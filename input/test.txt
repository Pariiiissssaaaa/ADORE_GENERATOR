to sum up why i would n't return : 1. very impatient hostesses - she asked `` how many ? ''
definitely their strong point .
oh yes the food - outrageously great ! fairly priced place not far from the strip .
drinks are also great .
i love barros ! reasonably priced , delicious , quality , pizza !
great little place to get away .
we were able to place the drink on our tab before 6 , then they served it when we were ready .
the bartender did n't know the beers they had on tap and seemed pretty out of it .
we just moved to las vegas and found this great sub shop .
definitely a very rich dish , and very yummy ! a friend of mine had the `` super avocado brunch '' and enjoyed it as well .
serving sizes are huge , staff is friendly . love going here and the wait is usually short every time i happen to go
this was a great atmosphere to be in , especially after a long day of traveling .
the lighting and decoration or lack of give a cold sterile atmosphere .
the slice of pork i got was way too salty tho , and that was my only negative .
decor is weird , though .
seemed very cheap considering the pricey restaurant .
the prices are very reasonable .
our server was nice , but we waited about 20 minutes to place our order and after that , more than 50 minutes to get our meals . it also took more than 15 minutes to get our check after we were done eating .
i really like the look and feel of this place . when the weather is nice , the patio is a great place to meet friends .
thank you jason for the great service !
very reasonably priced and great food .
my big problem was the ambience ... dusty dried flowers and picture frames ... filthy carpet , and do not use the restroom .
favorite cafe in the area ! the food always tastes home-made , fresh , and delicious .
the servers were very attentive .
the decor is pleasant but the darkness in the restaurant ( 7:30pm ) , reading the menu requires night vision goggles and makes the decor nearly invisible to appreciate .
it was interesting and reasonably cheap .
the only worker was making smoothies , which i understand , but at least he could have said something like `` i 'll be right with you guys '' .
just a heads up they do n't have liquor , only wine and beer .
the only negative , if you need the restroom bring a flashlight the lighting is really dim .
i opened my burrito and noticed the ends were n't even wrapped so it fell apart in my hands , the chicken was burned .
as for the drinks : -after all , the bar was just calling out to me and although i had hoped to see more beers on tap , unfortunately , a majority of their beer list was bottled .
i have experienced better . ( insert farting noise here )
i had the lemongrass collins and the whiskey berries jubilee . i loved that they were both flavorful without being sweet .
every table was dirty , the floor was disgusting with trash and food everywhere , and the men 's toilet was overflowing all over the floor .
it was pretty good but just had a single piece of pork belly , just one bite which was pretty disappointing .
i really liked their california veggie sandwich , which had delightfully unexpected sunflower seeds . my spouse had assorted chicken sandwiches as well as the charlie tuna sub and really liked those .
great concept for a pasta place quick and easy pasta they prepare the food fresh .
in addition , the chicken had some unidentifiable black material on the cut edge ( see picture ) .
the patio was a nice escape from the loud music .
the only response was `` you know what you did . you 're in the wrong bathroom '' i was confused .
apparently finding out what kind of drinks we wanted , getting us rung up , and moved along was more important . there was a small line behind me , but those customers can wait just as i had to wait for those who were in front of me .
a total of 5 in an order which is pricey but didnt mind paying for .
they have a huge selection of happy hour drinks and food .
i think the bartender may only be good at pouring beer .
the service was great the staff is super friendly and attentive .
it is really tasty , pretty decoration . the price is little bit expensive but it 's reasonable .
i got the vegetable curry and it was absolutely delicious .
small place but comfortable and intimate .
prices are very reasonable .
negatives - the only negative i can think of is the lighting is a bit dull and dated .
no atmosphere , poor lighting , so many things wrong .
the staff is always kind & they 're always quick even if it is packed .
their lunch deal is reasonable at $ 8 and comes with a great soup .
we ate here twice ; sangrias are fruity , mojitos are refreshing .
calamari were light and crispy . the chicken milanese was tender and flavorful .
making the location bigger was a welcome change . my favorite fast mexican place in the valley .
it was decent , but the pineapples were canned i believe .
i found it to be strange and thought i just got a bad bite , but it was all ridiculously hot and honestly just devoid of all flavor . i was not impressed .
and , even though i specified twice when ordering that this was a `` for here '' order , they still managed to put the drinks in paper cups ... .then proceeded to just dump that into a mug and call it good !
the patio is lovely this time of year .
the bathroom ( ladies room ) was disgusting and very messy .
coming in at around $ 11.50 the price was not bad .
it 's a good place to hang out , have some drinks , and relax .
i got my beer and i ordered dos equis but they brought another kind , but beer was beer and need beer in me .
also did n't enjoy the sauce that goes in all the sandwiches , bland and makes the sandwich really soggy .
given that price range one should expect that decent average size , at least for what they term as a special .
prices in casinos are always inflated so it obviously is n't going to be cheap but we still ate cheaper and better than senior frogs
needless to say , their pho is quite impressive , and i enjoyed their lemongrass tofu appetizer as well .
the ceviche mixto was stale and the only thing you could taste is the lemon juice .
love the decor and vibe the environment sets off . very casual but modern .
if you are not sure what to get i suggest the pre-fixe menu for $ 65 a person .
we went in and enjoyed the happy hour on almost all drinks .
thought the name meant beer or good drinks . beers were pricey .
would love to visit it again .
they were just awful and i do not think the tequila was patron .
i never have to force myself to drink anything with tequila in it , but their house margarita just did n't taste right .
to be fair it was , but not good enough to justify the price .
craft cocktail , i got the garden of eden , with grey goose was refreshing .
i hate to write reviews like this , but i just received the shittiest service at this place .
best brisket , by far , that i 've ever had . absolutely amazing ribs .
collards - they were old and tasteless .
plenty of vegetarian and vegan options too , definitely go try it if you have time and love indian food .
once we got over that hurdle he tried to explain that they have a `` special '' way of processing the vouchers that seemed like it was designed to alter what is stated on the voucher .
points for the decor though - the chandeliers were very pretty albeit seemed a little out of place .
the drinks are perfect .
the chicken is always juicy and vegetables are always fresh and with the spicy garlic sauce it is a completely wonderful sandwich .
great hh selection , too , between the drinks and food .
the frosting is n't too sweet and almost has a cream cheese flavor to it ?
they make a great product and charge a fair price .
you start off with a bottle of complementary and refreshing barley tea to be consumed out of tin bowls .
they have a great selection of wine and cocktails .
i had great luck with the wine recommendations .
very nice patio dining area with plenty of umbrellas for shade . the indoor dining area is very open with great decor .
sorry i expected better service when your spending $ 60 dollars for a steak .
we were here in vegas and the customer service was outstanding . shouts out to manny for making our late breafast a great experience .
good thing it is at a bar and i could get an ice cold draft beer .
the yelp event was wonderful , so we convinced friends to join us for brunch .
the ambiance reminded me a bit of a mountain lodge that is a favorite of ours .
i 've been trying replicate it at home but so far have n't been able to make it as good .
my husband loves spicy food and is a particular fan of the pork . i love the chicken and adore the side dishes of rice and beans , which are seasoned in a unique way and accompanied with the most delicious ( and fattening ) hand made tortillas !
they had a pretty decent beer selection from what i recall . additionally they offered wine selections .
love the art , music , vibe , food & everything about this business .
delicious food . reasonable prices .
the potions are fantastic and the wine list is extensive .
everything that i tried was either overcooked or bland except for the fried chicken wings and ice cream which ended up being most of what i ate .
the chicken had a little bit too much fat under the friend skin but that was beside me .
in total , we were there for 1hr and 45 minutes .
very fresh and reasonably priced .
i have been here a few times now , and it 's been pretty good !
not crazy about the overhead lighting - even though they 've gelled it in pretty colors , it still feels harsh .
i found the price a bit high , for the over all level of service and ambience you would expect if i 'm dishing out 50 per person .
we were craving some ethiopian and in cleveland is difficult to find , so we were glad to learn that zoma opened a month ago or so .
this did n't add up since other tables around me ( with 2+ people ) were being served ahead of me and had more complicated orders .
it was huge , so although i did n't pay for this one i would n't hesitate for pay for it another time .
i 've tried both the mild and intense and they are both good .
great variety in wine .
the food here was bland and tasteless .
the woman who takes the orders for take out food was horrible .
we ordered a hamburger , chicken and walnut salads , quesadilla and portabella mushroom pizza . all were yummy !
a little ghetto , but smart .
the lady at check in informed us that we could upgrade to the newly refurbished room for only $ 10 .
my boyfriend ordered the pesto pizza with shrimp and tomatoes on it and said that despite the fact that each slice was dripping with oil , it was a positive in his books .
very decent food at reasonable prices .
great service . very good sushi !
i ordered the roasted chicken dinner , and the chicken was mushy . the salad , potatoes , and rice were average , but the meat was very unappetizing .
it was cozy , it had a rustic vibe with the crates and tequila bottles in the background and was totally my style !
extremely disappointed in the service .
when my wrap came , the beef was neither hot nor cold , just luke warm .
the decor looked modern , and the atmosphere felt pretty classy .
my favorite item was the garlic knots .
: ( just goes to show how much customer service really matters , what 's the point of having food food if you ca n't get it to your customers efficiently , it took him 1 hour to get 2 street tacos and a burrito : / ..
however , the service was excellent and friendly !
originally i would 've paid $ 54 but with the card i paid $ 32 which is awesome .
my water was only filled at the end of the meal after i asked . when the check came the server shorted me on change .
the servers were so friendly and attentive and the food was great . we were also pleasantly surprised by the very reasonable prices .
it is my understanding that they are coming out with a new menu today , so it will be nice to see what has been added .
nice wines by the glass , great sparkling water , and great portions .
waitress was quick to advise us to say chef will only cook medium only as stated on the menu he decided to get it anyway .
it was very cool to walk through the kitchen on the way to the private room .
i asked the waiter if it was the right thing and he said yes ... i was surprised that something so tiny was priced that high .
the blueberry vodka lemonade was so refreshing on a hot summer day !
teriyaki was very very average , the rice underneath was all mushy .
but i 've been living in montreal for a while now and i miss that homey , nostalgic feeling of tacos , and i heard about this taco spot not too far from our place , so why not .
great food and wine at very reasonable prices .
really good happy hour ! both for food and drinks .
you can never go wrong with the classic mac and cheese pizza , but all of ian 's slices are incredible .
the egg on the baked pork chop rice was almost raw , like it was just cracked on top . pork chop was very fatty and i really hate when they give you a center cut pork chop that is dry !
they have decent food and decent prices .
first of all , all the decor is so homey and adorable with so much detail !
the only thing i do n't like was the cash only policy , i drove to atm first before i went .
any time a server delivers your margarita with , `` i 'm a terrible bartender because i like drinking too much .
service was good and prices very reasonable .
very , very filling , and very reasonably priced .
nothing fancy , though , and the walls and carpeting in the hallways were especially worn and in need of replacement .
i have eaten here many times and its great every time .
we also ordered two glasses of sangria and it was wonderful .
reasonable prices and great service too .
i love their mango margarita on the rocks .
biscuits were so hard and not eatable .
the place was more expensive than i thought it would be . i think the price range should be adjusted to moderate $ $ .
it 's just quite expensive .
also the chicken for their all you can eat special was not very fresh or hot .
for the prices that they charge , i expected far better service .
i have order from this place before and the pizza was never bad , i do n't know if was the type of pizza i ordered which was the bbq chicken pizza but i will never order it again , the chicken was over cooked the sauce on the pizza was dry it was by far very bland .
the table to our left was a very nice couple that offered to move seats so we could add to our group but we told them that was a very nice offer but not necessary because there was room elsewhere .
such a nice neighborhood bar .
great food deals , but portions are small . very small .
the prices were very reasonable .
the place was packed , i 'm sure because it 's quick service and delicious .
the margarita was n't anything special either .
it was actually really awful .
the staff make you feel welcome and they are very attentive .
we finished with a bottle of wine for desert that was just perfect .
seemed that the margaritas were the specialty but was not impressed , plus it came in a beer pint glass.. ?
they had a pretty decent beer selection from what i recall . additionally they offered wine selections .
she told us about the happy hour and when we ordered just one appetizer , she told us it 'd be like $ 2 more for another one ( $ 5 deal for two appetizers ) .
nachos and no beer does not make me happy .
the two tables near the window are very cute and offer a nice alternative to a traditional table or sitting at a bar .
i am generally easy to please but when you are paying $ 75 for a seven course meal , i expect fantastic not good .
a gross hole-in-the-wall that was bad as its tacky ambience and ugly surroundings .
when the fries on it 's own costs $ 7 on the menu .
for five dollars i felt like this was extremely overpriced and expected a lot more quality for a restaurant in chagrin falls .
the prices were fair too .
our server seemed sorry about it .
i had a purple haze beer to drink which was also great .
they have a bar and some high tables along with booths .
had nachos which were surprisingly meh . bar tap choice was kind of limited , and they did n't have all on tap .
food was good , service was terrible . feeling rushed the 35-40 minutes we were there was not very accommodating .
the ugly - too many tables in such less space . i felt horribly claustrophobic inside especially with the lights being so dim .
with roaring fireplaces , fountains , and stone architecture , this is a very pretty place to walk around .
the place is beautiful .
no problem , i thought . wrong .
this is a charming restaurant attached to an inn and bar in little italy , so points for the location and decor .
the pictures of the restaurant , do n't do justice - it looks and feels much more elegant in person .
was disappointed when i could n't get a blueberry blizzard , ok fine but really was n't impressed with how the lady behind the counter treated me like my request was absurd and then get impatient when i was like ok give me two seconds to decide what i want .
great beers and a nice wine list .
our server was super polite and kept the drinks coming ( plus they have slushy ice for their drinks woohoo ! )
portions are huge , great value .
the dish that i usually got and thought was the best i had ever had at a thai restaurant , was suddenly the worst .
if you find yourself in corktown , stop by . you 'll be glad you did ...
the drinks were delicious .
the cornbread was absolutely delicious .
the price point and value are pretty good .
it 's really not terrible - the 6 ounce tenderloin is $ 13 and it 's okay steak .
this room has la casual livingroom feel .
it 's a positive , progressive environment but i do think there is some room for improvement .
not sure what happened but food was soggy , or burnt , cold , and definitely not worth the trip .
the beef noodle soup was good . beef was tender .
prices were moderate for two close to $ 40 with unlimited coffee .
i do n't think anyone does really especially if we all know that you 're only paying $ 15- $ 20 for your dinner .
we had margaritas and beer , and the beer was the only thing with any alchohol content .
let 's not forget that it is very reasonably priced .
an overhead ceiling fan would have made the entire difference ... just a note .
loved the industrial looking interior .
i pay $ 25 bucks for ayce and yet i ca n't choose or eat anything freely .
fairly large bar area . no smoking is nice too .
for the money not a great value , as the rating says `` meh , i 've experienced better '' had the following : appetizer : rare tuna which was sliced too thin .
pretty ok selection of beer bottles and draught which is what i was after .
was drinking bottle beer so hard to not get that right .
after a couple $ 5 glasses of wine and some delicious calamari , i headed up to the main dining room .
spicy and delicious is a great description of this place . cozy , with quiet but upbeat music on the background and a wonderful fusion of asian cuisine .
but the bartenders were pretty poor at mixing a good margarita .
there was hardly any carmelized sugar on top , and the custard was very bland .
came out to a little over $ 30 including 2 sodas , delicious and worth ever penny .
last night i tried the sushi roll which was tasty , satisfying and beautifully presented .
the food was ok. it was good , definitely not bad . i was just expecting a bit more of a southwestern flavor .
the ramen comes in a huge size and is verry authentic .
the space is nice but a bit too busy , with a furniture shop and a bit of a confusing seating arrangement .
the price was ridiculous $ 30 for a k are one topping and 16 wings but whatever we were hungry .
we were planning on getting a bottle of wine but ended up feeling too hot to drink alcohol .
but again not sure about the $ 6 basket .
the value of the pizza is amazing considering how high the quality is . delicious fresh crust and toppings .
great colours and presentation , but not the best sorbet i had .
a server finally came out and we ordered our drinks . after 15 min of waiting we still did not have our drinks .
i did love the decor and layout though and the service was really good .
cheap good quality food , great value and you get pretty large portions for the price .
we were so frustrated and annoyed with the lack of attention , and the ridiculous process of `` splitting checks '' , that we did not even end up following the rest of our plans that night , and instead went home .
the environment was pretty unique and what makes this place cool .
condado has always been one of my favorite spots in the city .
i started with the rock shrimp which were lightly fried in a delicious batter with an equally good dipping sauce .
i know i could n't have been the first person to be confused by the layout .
i also got a vodka water and it was very strong .
it only cost me $ 6.49 for the whole meal including a small drink .
the garlic knots which are good and the ever so amazing arugula and prosciutto pizza to which i add a side of burrata cheese .
the small order can feed two . pbr is only $ 1 here .
it has a nice louisiana ambiance without trying too hard to fit a theme .
the food , however , is bland and is terrible bbq , even for the northeast .
the food was mediocre .
makes it uncomfortable to relax and eat .
the prices are very fair .
they had a nice thanksgiving style menu including a ton of traditional side dishes .
food is pretty good for the price .
it does n't stretch very far for the cost .
decent prices as well .
the wine is naturally also quite expensive , but some of the cheaper vintages of italian wine they carry offer are of superb quality for around 50 dollars .
good selection . excellent prices on wine list .
meh , ok , not great .
however the beer was cold , and they had smithwick 's on tap .
only thing was the seating this time , i felt the lighting was terrible , like i was in an interrogation room .
soggy greens and over processed and fried vegan food . i seriously felt sick after this .
the wings were great and the service was awesome . we went for a late night going away party for my manager and they were attentive , polite , and fun .
unfortunately the chicken was overcooked , tough and pretty tasteless .
i love this place .
total for $ 11 and change including a drink .
two the pizza is bigger and does provide more flavor . in the price range of $ 5 for a pizza it would be tough to find a better pie .
i love sushi and the salmon choice i ordered hit my palette and taste buds just right .
it 's a pretty tiny location , but i 've never had to wait over 5-10 minutes .
price was reasonable as well .
go for happy hour and meet friendly bartenders , happy hour taste treats and drinks .
the atmosphere and workers can make or break a food spot , and for this jersey mike 's the place is kept clean and the three dudes working we chill .
why the hell does lunch at a fast food court cost $ 16 ?
incredible experience from service to food , cocktails and wine .
the scallop roll is my favorite roll of all rolls .
it was loud and sort of clubby , but that 's part of the experience .
good food , reasonable prices .
i would not do that again as the atmosphere is not pleasant , harsh lighting and no decor .
the country fried steak breakfast , with chocolate pancakes cooked with bacon inside and topped with a full can of whip cream is the perfect way to end a perfect night . generous portions , and endless cups of coffee .
service was outstanding . great happy hour food and drink specials .
i split a delicious crispy chicken salad seasoned with rosemary with a friend , who ordered the butternut squash ravioli to share with me .
it was a great spot for lunch !
not 1 , but 2 times `` the kitchen was overwhelmed and lost the ticket . '' the server was anything but attentive .
the lemon chicken was barely edible .
the food though i thought could have been more for a $ 5 `` happy hour '' price .
had chicken udon which was good ... i never had udon before so i have nothing to compare it to ... .
we asked what was in the margaritas as in what kind of tequila and the bartender responded `` everything is tequila based like every margarita '' .
this location is super friendly .
now granted , $ 30 is n't a lot of money , especially in vegas , but it 's the principal right ? you get told one price , that should be the price .
last of all , my waiter ... started off pretty creepy ... like gon na poison your food and then you wake up in a basement type of creepy .
the interior is nothing like i 've ever seen before especially the bathroom- so cool !
the ambiance was sort of weird upstairs too , as there was a huge tv with sports .
the restaurant location is in a hip and vibrant area , but with dim lighting ( which i love ) ... i have been very pleased with the service .
disappointing all around . beer was ho-hum .
this place is great !
the workers were nice i guess , the food wasnt very good . everything about the place just seemed so damn old the wallpaper plates , ceiling , and decor .
with strip prices i feel like the prices here are reasonable .
poutine 's are done well , burgers were also good . their cheesecake is amazing !
i 'm glad i stopped by .
for starters , they have a fantastic wine list .
restaurant is clean and well kept though , so that is always nice .
so good . and the mini carrot on top feels oh so healthy .
the decor seems to be somewhat childish .
i have to say since the redesign of the space corner alley is much more attractive and welcoming from the exterior , but the bowling lanes are quite bright with all the windows now .
the only thing i was n't into was the decor , i can see the charm in it but it felt dusty and old without charm .
i should n't go into a restaurant and be afraid to complain .
cool place with good atmosphere !
gallagher 's really is top notch if you want a good steak in las vegas .
the food is not that great or cheap .
blueberry beignet : super sweet , not as fluffy as nola and wish it came out at the end as a dessert !
quality food and clean environment . their lunch specials are a total bargain .
sadly the mojito was better than the beer .
the draft beer was totally flat . pretty awful .
very new restaurant so some kinks to work out .
come on by for a visit , you 'll be glad you did !
family owned since 1991 it says on the menu , and a nice clean place with some outdoor seating too .
we love coming here for brunch .
great place , and super awesome people .
our new favorite neighborhood restaurant and favorite italian restaurant .
i got some creamy raspberry and vodka concoction , which was delicious .
bathroom was dirty with flickering lights , crayon marks on the walls , and a sink that did n't work .
i 've had pho at a few places but this is by far my favorite !
however the beer was cold , and they had smithwick 's on tap .
fresh , soft and crisp where necessary , the bread was simply fantastic !
everyone is insanely nice here and they always make a point of making you feel welcome .
staff is nice as well .
the beer was cold , they have jameson and a tequila on draft and they serve tacos late .
restaurant is a bit loud so be prepared .
the venue is new and really nice now .
my scallops were good , though i felt like the bacon strips were gratuitous and made the dish feel cheaper than it actually was .
we waited 45 minutes for a table , and were seated in the most awkward spot : between the bar and the stairs going down to the bathroom .
the staff was all great and did what they could to make our night perfect !
friendly staff ! my friend loves the generous pour on their wines ( especially during happy hour ) .
drive thu was the slowest i 've seen in my entire life , and i was given a disingenuous apology from the staff who noted that an employee `` just walked out '' .
this place is right by my office and i ate here 3x so far .
the draft beer was totally flat . pretty awful .
reasonable prices on beer as well .
at lunch this dish is only $ 10 .
the ladies bathroom was very cold and smelled funny . the men 's room urinal was broken and the toilets were dirty .
the different spices used to season the veggies on the sub were fantastic !
and the frozen margarita did n't seem to have hardly any tequila .
i had the duck curry and the sticky rice and they were both delicious . the prices were very reasonable .
once we got our food , the chicken fries were very bad . they had a bad aftertaste and seemed to have more breading then chicken .
this makes this dish very greasy in a way that i rejected it after one bite - may be that is ok for a real korean type dish but unfortunately , not for me .
we were the only table she had to tend to for half of our visit there and she would not acknowledge our needs .
this was kind of amusing .
the sushi area was good since they had fresh salmon and tuna for you to eat .
kind but like all salesmen trying to get you to order tequila , drinks , ( at 11 am ) beer , margaritas , dessert ? anything ?
but over charging for chicken that has been over breaded and full of oil , will not have us returning there again .
it could look nicer if the lights were n't so harsh .
i paid $ 5.59 for a half salad and while good , incredibly overpriced .
i found the prices a little high ( $ 16 for a salad ?
service was fast . the staff was super nice !
prices are reasonable too .
mens bathroom apparently was a nightmare ( took away a star ) vomit in sink , urine and feces on floor : / womens bathroom was fine .
great food at a reasonable price .
great view . food is ok. nice place to enjoy with a couple friends .
i also am addicted to the rose water tea .
would recommend . prices are good , not cheap but not pricey .
the lady was super rude on the phone , she kept cutting me and it seemed like she had better things to do at that moment , she barely paid attention to what i was saying and guess what ?
they both were just a little bland but still had good flavor .
that was kind of creepy .
they are priced very fair .
i am excited to visit again and can only hope to have adrian the second time around !
pizza , calamari , and mussels are delicious !
it was refreshing and awesome .
great selection of wines , too !
the hostess seemed in a horrible mood too , so as we sat down we had a bad taste in our mouth and were worried it was going to be a disastrous meal .
excellent flavor on all the tacos . i also had the guac and chips which was tasty .
the idea of paying $ 5 to play some used board games seems pretty steep to me as well . a max of $ 2 seems more appropriate to me , or better yet , just make the games part of the visit , especially when the coffee is so highly priced , that should be pricing in the cost of the game play .
we got there a little early so we sat in the lounge its very nice , it also has great view of the city .
and pretty damn good also for $ 12 or $ 14 , that atleast did come with french fries .
david . wonderful suggestions , excellent knowledge on the menu .
delicious ! we 've driven past this place 1,000 times and never noticed it .
this place is da bomb ... interesting combinations you can mix and match . i had the chile relleno , egg foo young , jerk fried rice and imperial chicken which is fantastic .
in terms of the fried noodles and rice , the prices are very reasonable , ranging from $ 5- $ 7 , and you will not be disappointed , they are absolutely amazing .
i chose white and was pleasantly surprised to get a gin and thyme collins . my favorite liquor with a very unique herb-y , sweet taste .
lighting in the rooms were terrible - ladies , good luck applying makeup - men , best of luck shaving !
while living in vegas , it was one of my favorite restaurants .
the atmosphere is pretty calm .
the only thing i did n't care for was their chicken alfredo tortellini .
total damage for xl : $ 35 this is n't the best pizza i 've tried but it 's one of the top places in markham .
the apology i received is appreciated but unfortunately does not make up for this horrible experience .
unfortunately , unlike the original , they do not have any good lunch deals and after spending $ 30 for two people on pizza and a side salad , they charged $ 1 for sides of ranch .
if that can be fixed , i would completely recommend this resturant ... but now no . sad because the food is good .
it was replaced with another draft beer that was n't that great either .
i thought the glasses of wine were pretty pricey .
i have been so excited about amelie 's coming to south charlotte for months .
i ordered the cora special , the bacon was the kind you put in the microwave at home , the pancake was a weird spongy material , however the eggs were good and the home fries so-so .
the food speaks for itself , fresh burgers with ultra fresh toppings with a unique bun and sauce .
started with lemon drop martinis and a dirty martini , made via our server 's recommended vodka .
i sought out the server who was overtly rude and flippant .
the fries had a clean crisp flavor and were perfectly salted .
the ambiance was lovely .
like the dark knight ; ) you know what i mean !
so sushi 7/10 ; fish very fresh , but so so so thin , i barely tasted the fish unless i take it out of the roll .
decor is nice and modern with a red and black theme , as well as pretty chandeliers all around . the place was clean overall and nice ambience for a group dinner .
price is good . food is good .
of the spicy miso chips with tuna tartar - excellent !
i got fried chicken which was seasoned well . the other person order bake chicken which was also seasoned well !
i felt as i observed around that we were the closest table near the kitchen that it was obvious we were large and our server needed help running drinks from the bartender it was n't that busy that someone especially higher up in management would consider coming by to help and support the waiter .
i love the watermelon and grapefruit beers .
the lighting was a bit dim , but still enough light that i was n't squinting .
ordered chicken pad thai to go and i did n't notice until i got home that they put tofu instead of chicken .
always a great time .
meal size , on one hand they 're charging you premium prices but one entree is only good for one person , funny is n't it .
i understand the absence of newspaper , but now it is a thin square of processed mystery crap with lots of awful breading .
we ordered a side if meatballs that were doused in sauce which were good but they did n't serve or offer bread .
a small town s $ 7.49 , totally reasonable considering its huge .
the wings were tasty especially when i added hot sauce and i really loved the peanut butter pie !
the ambiance was very nice , not dark where i could n't see the menu but not glaring bright either .
i gave this one a three stars mostly because we ordered a pitcher or margarita and honestly i did not taste any tequila .
no good . clean but weird decor .
prices are outrageous for the quality of food but that 's a function of vegas .
tasty pizza but was disgusted at the nasty flies in the kitchen near all the topping .
some of the most bland food i have ever eaten .
great prices too , $ 8 for the salad .
the music is so loud we had to shout to hear each other .
my only complaint was the bbq sauce was kinda average .
attend only when necessary .
anyway , it was nothing special for $ 23 .
taj downtown is a much better deal at only 4 $ more . save your money .
we sat on the patio directly across from the bellagio fountains and we loved the ambiance !
ladies , careful when wearing heels ... the floor is slick , or maybe it 's how i walk .
the water was disgusting , tasted like dish water .
i really enjoyed this place for lunch and dinner .
roof top dining is awesome .
they have a really cheap daily special , but normal lunch specials are fair enough on price .
they had tons of different options for a reasonable price of $ 12.00 restaurant is very clean and staff are nice .
this is one of our favorite place .
i really liked the potstickers and ample pours of wine ! ; ) my coworker was also really happy with the service .
i do n't mean if the decor is tacky or outdated .
get the dinner deal for 4 for only $ 62 .
the prices are also very reasonable .
bathroom was dirty with flickering lights , crayon marks on the walls , and a sink that did n't work .
they do a decent job for their style pizza sandwiches salads .
expensive for what you get .
the room was old and tiny which i could have dealt with too but the wallpaper in bathroom was filthy . the entire bathroom was dirty .
the staff was nice and polite but the music is way too loud to enjoy a normal conversation . i 'd go back ... .
the pad see ew taste like eating a noodle with fish sauce , the general chicken tasted like a cardboard box that was stuffed with rice in the bottom , you could hardly reach , because they stuffed the chicken and veggies on top it literally looked like poop !
bartender was cute and genuinely friendly .
spectacular taste and generous portions . service was extraordinary .
they heard me mention our anniversary and they all wished us a happy anniversary .
the beer is cold and i have mixed drinks about feelings .
the prices were cheap for quality .
not a fan of the color scheme or the lighting -- it just does n't give me that warm , fuzzy feeling i like in a neighborhood joint .
only thing i missed was a garlic mayo . but the rest was so good , i did n't even miss it .
the place had a great vibe of music decor and service .
the only drink i got was a white wine sangria and it was delicious .
they were extremely gracious and helpful from the get go . the bar area was perfect for our event and the watershed has a great casual atmosphere .
the decor is pretty basic and they let people write on the walls .
the total for the 4 of us was around $ 60 .
we loved the inside bar , the outside courtyard with beautiful twinkle lights at night , the luscious and decadent lobby , and the interesting rooms that are out of the ordinary .
the bathroom was beautiful and spotless but i 'll just say this : i hate bathroom attendants . that is all .
great friendly service . enjoyed !
prices are really fair , quality is decent , and service is nice .
it 's clean , safe and reasonably priced .
and recommended all the right drinks .
we did tell the hostess and another gentleman that our service was slow today and all they said that they were sorry .
the prices are really good too .
together with the dingy furniture and shabby decor , i was seriously worried about food poisoning . the service was pretty bad too .
the hand towels in the bathroom had stains on them , the water from the sink had a horrible smell , ugh .
neither of my beers were apparently classified for happy hour .
prices are very reasonable .
i just want to say i would be careful about purchasing any coupons affiliated with this restaurant .
too bad no beer though .
for those who are complaining about this place , keep in mind it 's only been one week of opening .
the martinis in the bar are awesome .
bolgogi everything ! super affordable and generous , delicious fusion combinations .
all you can eat , all you can drink ( beer , wine , champagne ) , and it was great !
the only thing i do n't like as much is the décor ( except the hanging lights ) .
do n't know if it 's a glitch in their lighting or the electrical service , but it got a bit annoying .
i would say you get what you pay for but for a total of $ 160 for one night , this was a complete rip off .
with some subtle lighting this place would be great but i felt like i was in a parking lot - you could not turn towards the one light without getting a painful beam of light in your eyes .
not only do they have this ridiculous , unethical , undetectable rule , but they became extremely rude and angry when i calmly challenged this action .
i liked the fried cheese one , but felt the beans overpowered the saltiness of the cheese so made it kind of bland . the churros i thought were great , especially because of the caramel sauce that comes with it .
cheap , fast , good . you can have duck for a very reasonable price here .
at the end of my meal , i paid + tipped the waiter , and then tried to give him some constructive criticism about how the food quality was poor compared to the prices .
the corkage was $ 50 for one bottle , which i consider to be a real scam . that is insulting .
the most disappointing thing though was that i could n't taste the tequila in my margarita and when i ordered two more shots to add the bartender got offended . would never recommend
the food is okay . the markup on the bar is very high .
went on a wednesday . loved the martini specials and varieties .
it 's terrible . it tastes like crappy ice cream ...
had the rose lychee martini ; hands down he best drink i 've ever had .
the gravy they add is a little weird for my taste , it 's not sweet or sour , it 's more of a bitter taste .
this drink was light and refreshing and definitely not weak .
good music , trendy atmosphere and good crowd .
it would be nice if they could get rid of the tags in the men 's room , the graffiti is just kind of ugly and detracts from the rest of the place .
i kind of enjoy how tacky the taste in decoration is .
which turned out to be bitter , we also had the black chicken soup , which was not done very well .
after a couple of weeks of ridiculous training ( including more homework than college ) , she was then put to work .
absolutely love this place !
we have been here twice and have enjoyed both visits .
we also had 2 bottles of a great sangiovese our waiter recommended .
salad was huge and very fresh . grilled chicken is very tasty .
drinks and wine were good , although pricey .
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
+ good food , reasonable price .
the decor is a bit gaudy , but i 'm fairly certain that 's by design .
in their defense , the bottled beer was good .
it was still an amazing drink .
loved the drinks as well !
the prices here are pretty unbeatable and food is great .
this one is worse than the normal puke & choke .
the food was wonderful . perfectly seasoned and prepared .
the decor is abysmal ; it looks like an applebees that has n't nailed all of the crap to the walls yet .
the manager here ( possibly owner ) is a complete asshole .
this place is a bit pricey but not ridiculous .
i had to ask for additional lemon for the table - i 'm not sure why they insist on bringing one slice at a time .
we had a couple of the house margaritas during happy hour and they were sweet but tart .
price and food is very nice .
all in all , neither great nor terrible ... just meh
after such a bad experience you would think they would also cover the one glass of wine and pint of beer but nope !
we even ordered some jalapeño bombers that were served individually in shot glasses that were really hot and fresh .
china go-go ... do n't be turned off by the simple and relatively awkward decor .
the food was delicious .
i think everyone at our table had either wine or beer ( they have an ok beer selection , but nothing fancy , and only bottles ) .
everything is very high quality and for what you get , the prices are very good . the happy hour and lunch specials are really good deals .
maggiano 's provides the greatest dollar for dollar value in scottsdale .
first impression , really dark and sexy ( for lack of a better word ) .
they are dripping with juice and dressing ( which makes it good ) but if you do n't eat it rather soon it will be soggy .
if you are looking for really cheap ( average ) drinks for happy hour , then mi pueblo is a bargain .
love the apps and drinks .
all u can eat high quality food for only $ 15 lunch and $ 20 dinner .
even though it was late and they were getting ready to close , he was in no hurry and had such a great attitude .
the price was vegas expensive for horrible food .
their philly cheese steaks and calzones are cooked properly and taste wonderful .
the drinks are also incredible . would recommend the lillet rose martini and bavette 's punch .
but we were able to catch views of the pool .
for a fine dining restaurant this surprised me ... the drinks were overpriced but luckily we received two free drink tickets with our meal as we were walking around the hotel , so that made up for some of the disappointment .
if this restaurant was inside the venetian or bellagio , the meals would easily be $ 150 per person .
the bartender made me a perfect mojito and my friends got christmas ale on tap .
very quick service and decent prices .
the bottled beer was n't as cold as we like it .
it is so addictive with the sauce and just fried goodness.. i could eat two portions of these on my own .
the restaurant itself looks nice , although the interior plywood siding gives it an `` unfinished '' feeling that i was n't very fond of .
he said i could but it would be more expensive . not sure why the other guy says no .
do n't get me wrong , the food was great , but the restaurant itself was seriously lacking the df grandeur with it 's low tiled ceiling and lack of windows .
the service is always very pleasant and the atmosphere is really good . always play good music , you do n't feel rushed to get out and the restaurant is very comfortable .
i ended up shaking some hot sauce over it .
if i were to base the review only on the service and how friendly the employees are , then i would give it more stars .
pretty cool , but not cool enough for me to come back .
the dragon balls are a must ! they have a lot of other unique items .
also the bathroom stinks and is kinda dirty .
service was great and quick !
the fresh vegetables were also perfectly cooked .
the bartender was nice and made a good drink .
great place for a late night snack .
we love eating here !
$ 30 ( some change ) for two people is not bad for all you can eat .
good eats and lots of food for a reasonable price .
my lunch was ok. i was so excited by the menu , but the food was a little bland , a little lukewarm .
food was decent and reasonable prices .
the so called famous chicken fried steak was too bland and mostly batter . they also ran out of bbq ribs on a saturday night which is apparently due to lack of planning i suppose .
walking in and seeing different colored lights , a screen with images that changed such as faces and lips and white sheer drapes hanging , made it sexy and pretty .
the sushi here is very good .
it 's hard not to like slices .
they have tv 's in every direction to watch whatever game is on and great contemporary music keeping the place exciting .
the meat was tough with a hint of fishy smell .
the only reason to come is to drink beer out of the schooner glasses but alas they only have crap beer on tap .
the decor is light and airy . the colors are happy .
a sorry sure would have helped the situation .
the price was very reasonable .
night shift girls are unprofessional . side conversations are more important to them than assisting their costumers ... so sad .
very authentic and the prices are more than reasonable .
i only ordered a salad & was thrilled to be able to put as many toppings on as i liked . i did n't however like that the meats were ice cold i.e .
the gazpacho was great !
the workers are so nice and the vibe inside and out is really cool and relaxing !
i also recommend trying the pasta dishes spaghetti and meatballs are great they have rich marinara sauce and the meatballs are flavorful and large .
had shrimps and clams and they both taste bad . they did n't even taste fresh .
i recommend it for a happy hour .
was tasty and the greens were refreshing .
bright and cozy atmosphere .
from the fire place upon entering , to the darker wood decor in the dining room , and the $ 18 sirloin with a huge baked potato , you really ca n't go wrong .
the prices are excellent .
the burritos are huge and pack great flavor and a low price of $ 5 .
prices are right on .
price is ridiculous for the food .
the owner and his staff are always very friendly . gino 's is one of my favorite places to grab a quick lunch .
i wanted to eat seafood so bad , and i stumbled upon this new joint on yelp !
interesting cocktail selections with premium spirits and fresh squeezed juices and house made syrups . i loved the seasonal sangria .
went here during `` restaurant week '' where their normal prix fix menu ( $ 44 ) was $ 30 .
extra charges for unnecessary changes , in addition to a bad experience in the winter time requesting a seat indoors and not in the tent area where it was freezing .
everything else tasted good , but the breading on the chicken was so hard it actually hurt my teeth .
to begin with the tables , booths , fake plants and sagging ceiling tiles are any combination of worn out , dirty or sticky .
however experienced worst service that day .
i also got a cadillac margarita that tasted like they just lazily put the alcohol and margarita mix .
it was hard finding it , it was random where it is at , ghetto feeling casino that felt dingy dirty etc.. interior decor of the restaurant was lack luster ... .
i personally do n't eat much meat ( besides chicken ) so i had this fried tofu sandwich thing ( not sure what its called ) which appeared on the restaurant menu but not on their online menu ... which i recommend they update !
it was ok beer was not that great tasting you ca n't even buy a small glass of beer without buying a flight .
our server was pleasant , ambience was enjoyable .
weak drinks , there i said it .
a good value for the money .
the mac and cheese on it 's own was nice and creamy with a lovely light panko bread crumb crust on the top .
nice little cozy cafe .
the pizza that was ordered was n't good but the salmon meal was apparently very good .
after we were seated we were in a somewhat awkward spot along the hallway to the bathroom . across from the wine wall which was nice décor but the constant stream of people and tight quarters to the table behind us was not the romantic date night atmosphere we had anticipated .
this is curious because we received them about 2 minutes after they were ordered .
he 's creepy , not classy , not sophisticated , and forced his way into our table 's conversation .
an excellent starter spiedini : skewers of hot prosciutto wrapped around italian fontina cheese over a bed of arugula .
i think there were only 3 or 4 beers offered , draft and bottled .
not a huge beer drinker but this was pleasant : malty with hints of citrus .
the place has a cool tiki bar atmosphere .
i came here two days in a row because dang this place has some great food !
after about 5 minutes a woman came and asked gruffly what was wrong with the dish .
to drink i had a coconut water coffee with chocolate ; interesting combination but it was perfect .
a beautiful , hip , and industrial look give this newish casino more charm than any other downtown . i can not wait to throw my wedding here in mere weeks !
it tastes really bland . except the peanut sauce , i ca n't taste anything else .
very very reasonable price ! they are big and not expensive .
the waffles were cold , dry and bland .
the decorations are interesting . the inside is amazing .
it 's very cheap .
price : most dishes are between $ 5.50 to $ 7.50 , pretty reasonable for the amount of food .
it was easy for the waitress to split the bill which included splitting the price of the bottle of wine we had .
barbecue with rice a very simple but delicious meal . portion size is pretty good and i tastes great .
great place to rest your feet , grab some fresh baked treats , and sip some coffee or iced tea . go upstairs for a great view of the plaza below .
always a go to spot when we 're looking for a delicious manhatten or margarita for 5 bucks during happy hour .
the crust was very flimsy and again tasted raw and very very difficult to chew .
in regards to drinks , the pomegranate soju is enjoyable as well as cass , korea 's no . 1 beer .
they have everything and then some . the food quality is excellent .
the only beer they had was budweiser .
food was affordable and quite good for the price .
there were dead bugs in the bathroom light , tiling in the shower falling apart , sprinkler a over the bathroom mirror had no cover , you could see up into the ceiling .
i finally got my drink , the soda was flat , and when i got my food , the buns were stale and the fried were old and cold .
sucks for pictures , pretty dark .
the service is fine . the food is good and reasonably priced .
really , for the price it should be amazing or the sizes should be increased .
i had a mule to start off with for a drink and it was unique .
15 dollars for a large pizza that was mediocre at best . 15 bucks .
the valentino 's is our norm - it has a great combination of flavors with a little bite from the peppercinis . the caprese salad is also a favorite - the house dressing is awesome !
this place is below ordinary and expensive .
this place is awesome !
i absolutely hated their choice of glassware . wine served in tumbler glasses and martinis served in a weird sort of snifter .
on a different note , the men 's bathroom was very messy and there was no soap or paper towels anywhere .
the only beer they had was budweiser .
just had lunch here , tiny bit of a wait , but totally worth it . mini quesadillas , soooo delicious !
the `` og '' margarita was n't bad in flavor , but did n't have any indication that any tequila was in it .
the portions are good and the taste is excellent .
it kind of tasted like a spicy salmon cake smothered in sauce .
very expensive drinks -- we paid $ 32 for 5 coronas .
the pork stew is really good and my husband really enjoyed the chili relleno .
it could look nicer if the lights were n't so harsh .
my teriyaki was drenched in sauce , loosing any other flavours in the dish . my friend took general tao and we struggled to find the chicken .
that 's high even by the strip prices .
yum ! i so hope this place stays open for good !
top it all off with a yelp check-in offer of 5 free shots ( yep , 5 ! )
i usually stick to the shrimp because it 's my favorite but there oysters and soft shell crab is another of my favorites !
they do n't serve hard alcohol but have beer and wine .
i got a glass of some other kind of beer in a nasty glass .
overall , the food was fine and certainly a good-sized meal for only $ 14 .
the food was not fresh and the house special duck failed miserably in comparison to what i remember when i ordered it a few months ago , and it did n't even taste like duck ( i would n't be surprised if it was just chicken and they just added duck sauce ) .
instead of getting that version i could only get a plain waffle with strawberries on the side .
additionally i was very surprised that they had a cocktail selection .
it was very thin and flavorful .
for appetizers , the seafood pancake is amazing .
prices are also very reasonable .
staff is friendly . the pool area is awesome .
disappointed they did n't have liquor but only wine or beer - had to order sangria .
this horrible attitude does n't surprise me coming from employees , but the owner 's was just as bad .
great value selection and service . i recommend this buffet .
both of us ordered the sangria ( he did n't love it so yay two cocktails for me !
when i think of a `` buffet '' i think of dry , cheap food that has been sitting under a heat lamp for hours .
the noodles are delicious and the broth in the beef packs quite a flavor punch . pair that with some of the potstickers and you 've got a pretty solid trip to flavor town .
it was just a very dirty bathroom .
when we finally decided to leave one of the servers decided to take her tip from my friends cash and returned her change with no receipt for verification .
stemmed like a typical bar with too many beers available , but did have my lame beer if choice coors light .
what a great find on our way from lv .
ok - it 's mandu , hard to mess up husband actually liked his pbs which is unusual .
pizza taste was mediocre - not a new favourite or anything . similar to other reviews , crust was more burnt that i 'd preferred .
food is not great but very cheap .
the decor is nice , although i 'm a bit thrown off by faucets and bathroom theme .
the food was bland .
the food was mediocre at best . there was a weird aftertaste for the pretzels and cheese dip .
prices are really good too .
the very high cost is the only thing making this a 4 instead of a 5
stay here , you will love it !
outside is equally beautiful , including tables and chairs that surround firepits .
their salsa and hot sauce is amazing as well . the beef tacos , cheese enchiladas are yummy too !
i am originally from california and have been waiting for a poke place to open in the scottsdale/phoenix area so once i heard of this place opening i had to come try it !
great food and cheap cheap cheap .
watermelon juice - very refreshing on a hot summer day , but nothing too special .
this was rubbery , chewy and bland .
the hamburger was dry and tasteless . it is served on a huge bun , which was fresh but way too much bread , and the philly cheese steak unfortunately was not any more appetizing .
shrimp and muscles were good too .
the prices are reasonable as well .
under $ 16 for two people to have an incredibly filling and delicious meal ?
the lighting was n't too bright or too dim , just right .
beer choices were weak , wine choices were fine .
we also ordered shots of the coffee patron & baileys : strong but good !
i love their pinakbet ( vegetable dish ) and their inihaw na baboy ( grilled pork ) .
the girls had skinny margaritas that came in what looked like `` toy '' glasses and had hardly any tequila .
the butter chicken on the other hand , not so much .
small place but pretty intimate which i like .
my sandwich came with a tomato on it ( which i dislike reg raw tomatoes ) but it was easy to take off so i did n't complain .
the atmosphere for the restaurant is super chill .
they have a great affordable lunch buffet which is always freshly stocked and yummy .
attentive , polite and gracious .
not only that the food is over priced .
there is also a shelf full of hot sauces , the choices and combinations are endless !
also the happy hour is fantastic with half off margaritas .
service is generally bad and the food is mediocre ... never going back .
it 's the little details that sets frank 's kitchen apart from the other ( very ) good spots along college . from the warm and genuine welcome , the gorgeous , but understated decor , the little hooks for my purse at the bar ( should be standard everywhere ) , to the attentive and smart service , dinner on a thursday night was remarkable .
decor : it 's so colourful ( not in a tacky `` ugly betty '' way ) i love it !
great times and drinks .
the designer did a great job in selecting the light fixtures , colour scheme , furniture , etc .
the chicken was salty and there 's a spice that they add to the chicken that gives it an off taste .
outstanding flavor , and really cool to get to eat the type of food that 's on the tv show .
the margarita was terrible and we ordered the chicken wings and they were tiny and chewy .
that the staff was so kind and helpful and was not in any way annoyed by this inconvenience .
it 's surprisingly light , and comes in a ton of different varieties .
food is not stellar the atmosphere is kind of gloomy like eating in a basement .
our server was beyond courteous and made some awesome recomendations for both food and beverages !
when we did get the right food it was good like einstein 's should be .
some chicken pieces felt off and a little chewy .
the ambiance is amazing with the cirque ceilings .
when drunk , finding the bathroom at remedy 's is like a mini maze .
the decor is bright and dramatic with a blatant disregard for subtly , and yet is perfectly muted so that even the worst hang-over would be welcomed by it 's glowing neon .
the walls have splatter of food , there is trash on the ground , stains on the ground , and it just looks dirty .
a very disappointing mother 's day was spent here waiting and waiting for our food to be served .
i highly recommend this place if staying in the area !
the place is pricey as with most high end restaurants in vegas but not ridiculous like guy savoy or robuchon .
this place was great !
the mushroom side dish was bland and the sweet potato fries were mainly the little pieces you get at the bottom of the bag - for the price disappointing .
awesome martinis and good service .
came here on a wednesday night with a friend , and we were surprised to be seated right away on the patio .
it 's expensive but not a bad value .
the service took forever . the food was mediocre .
the florescent lights are not only stained , filthy and flashing , but also different colors .
surprisingly , this is more than the college bar . the food is served fresh and fast , and the prices are moderate .
all you can drink for $ 2.50 , fresh and delicious .
now mind you it costs a pretty penny to dine here , so do n't expect huge portions .
of course you 'd expect this from a $ 19 burger but still cheap in vegas .
the reviewer who said he paid $ 7 for a little burger is wrong -- it 's $ 5.29 for the little hamburger and $ 5.99 for the little cheeseburger , not counting premium fixings ( as of this review ) .
they serve decently priced food that is fine .
and this might sound weird but the lighting was perfect .
the drink specials on jameson were great .
and the sad thing is , it 's usually cold and dry when you get it .
the glass of house merlot was good .
the lunch special is a steal at 5 bucks !
terribly salty `` lobster roll '' on greasy bread . undercooked fries .
prices are n't cheap , but are decent for what you get .
food prices and drink prices were pretty reasonable .
this is our favorite date night spot .
their happy hour is absolutely amazing . their mojitos and sangria are off the charts !
the last names was peeling off on the wall , even with tapes and pins on , it 's obvious and looking ugly on my photos .
they do n't serve hard alcohol but have beer and wine .
service was awful and the restaurant was slow !
whether this spot is slammed on a friday night , or you check it out during lunch hour , you will be pleased with the quality of the food and service .
a weak beer selection with the bar running out of the crafts ?
all the curtains were down too which made it unnecessarily dark . mediocre .
my fiancé and i enjoyed eating here very much and found the employees to be immensely helpful and friendly .
i have never been treated so badly in a restaurant before .
i only had beer .
the decor is nice , the patio very comfortable , even on hot evenings , it 's in my neighborhood , and the food , when you finally get it , is good . the big problem i have is the terrible service .
i pretty much stick to my beer basics so i ordered a corona bottle .
dessert was good with a nice selection of tarts and cakes .
so incredibly overpriced $ 30 for all you can eat .
all around a tasty , reasonably priced establishment .
stemmed like a typical bar with too many beers available , but did have my lame beer if choice coors light .
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
over time , we have tried almost everything on the menu , and found every dish to be unique and creative , with the greatest , most complex but enjoyable flavors imaginable .
the restaurant is obviously short of staff . i only saw 2 waiters running in and out through the entire place .
the food was delicious , filling and reasonably priced .
customer service is excellent , and everyone is super friendly !
would recommend with spot to anyone looking to have lunch with a friend or by yourself : )
the comments about frederick douglas ... now those are right on .
the pizza is delicious , not unlike the yucky cheap $ 5 little caeser stuff.. & i love their buffalo wings ! usually they are a hit or miss with me , but theirs is delicious !
a little on the bland side .
the chicken tostada was ok but it came with a pathetic amount of sour cream and they left off the guacamole i ordered .
when paying almost $ 20 for chicken strips you expect over the top .
pizza was great . crust was perfect .
the margarita had hardly any alcohol in it , though .
$ 16 for a bad sub is just ridiculous .
we had margaritas and beer , and the beer was the only thing with any alchohol content .
sorry , do n't feel comfortable giving 5 stars to a place with dirty floors and sinking ceilings .
the `` thing '' on the ceiling ... well , i 'm not sure of its purpose .
i had the elderflower martini without the sugar rim , nice but pricey ( along with most martinis in vegas ) .
no complaints on not having a full glass of beer .
the waitress serving on the other hand is atrocious .
i got a glass of some other kind of beer in a nasty glass .
seating is also pretty good and i really like the casual atmosphere of the restaurant .
with everything ala carte , you can easily spend $ 60 to $ 75 dollars for a complete dinner .
also nice fruity and refreshing drinks with a nice kick .
great tasting lebanese food with many vegetarian options .
called them up and their attitude was horrible . this was a delivery order .
everything is very reasonably priced .
stick to the beer ... the bartender did n't know how to make an manhattan and produced an overly strong , undrinkable concoction .
the ambiance is fun and inviting with a relaxing , casual beach vibe .
and they only cost $ 5 . i recommend getting the bacon .
if anything , i liked that fact that our server was n't bothering us every five minutes or trying to get us out of there .
the prices are all reasonable especially the daily specials and the $ 7.99 dinners .
room was nice , but expected more . hallway was dirty , bathroom ceiling had hair stuck to it , ( gross ) , no coffee maker or refrigerator .
the beer selection was solid , but i would n't come here for cocktail or anything . beer and shots only .
if i spend $ 100 on lunch for 3 people , it should be somewhat decent .
extremely dirty and the hot chocolate gives you diarrhea . wet floor and the bathroom has no toilet paper .
the decor was pretty casual . i had expected something a bit more fancy given the location and the `` sushi lounge '' name .
it 's all easily affordable and you can relax in their clean and modern seating area while they make their food .
customer service is horrible .
price per person was under $ 10 , and portion sizes were awesome .
i called ahead to make sure it was kid-friendly ... the woman on the phone said there was no kids menu ( totally fine ) but that there were plenty of high chairs so come on in .
would like a bit more meat if possible , for the price charged .
this was kind of amusing .
it is by no means swanky -- i thought that the kind of tacky dolphin theme was fun and it felt clean .
the beer was decent and drinkable .
unfortunately , they have no beers .
drinks outrageously priced , menu small selection and very pricey .
the bar tender did n't know the beers on tap , which were only 8 beers .
love the ambiance , decor and vibe of the place . a great hangout !
the staff here was so very very friendly !
the tomato sauce was spread so thin we could hardly tell that it was on the pie and the pepperoni was near non-existent .
well drinks are pretty weak , so i stick to beers .
great food and wine .
all the noodles in soup were flavourful and rich with generous sized portions , and the one i got had a good amount of fish slices and fish cake , which was great !
the place has a great wine list with a sommelier that is very good recommendations .
only bad took 30 minutes to get our burgers but she explained and apologized due to having a party .
only negative thing i 'll say is the bathroom area was dirty ! the hallway to the bathroom was pretty gross .
great food , great , friendly staff , great covered lakeside outdoor dining terrace with fireplace .
and yes , she either bought us a round or forgot to put it in , but since she did n't say anything `` like , hey , i bought this round , sorry for the service issues '' , i have to assume she forgot .
draft beer was not as cold as it should be , order bottles . crappy music .
i was only notified that there was an issue with the cooling system because i asked them to turn up the air .
my steak was like it was cooked that morning - tough , then microwaved at 5 o'clock in the afternoon .
the price was high for the amount of food and quality versus competitors .
courteous to our family .
i was drinking their buca bella specialty drink , quite refreshing .
my buddy and i had a pretty good time here late one sunday night .
dinner was n't too bad , it came out to under $ 100 per person .
the design in this restaurant is breathtaking !
liquor cheap at the bar - happy hour all day !
the servants just kept us there and did n't even have time to get us hot tea .
cocktails & wine selection are both also fantastic .
the rabbit dish is good .
the couch was nice ... pretty new with a chaise on the end .
sadly the mojito was better than the beer .
i enjoyed the happy hour beer pricing .
but taste wise it was pretty decent .
love bryan 's bbq one of my favorite places to go . highly recommend this place to everyone .
i usually get a beer and as much as i enjoy a cold mug of beer i do wish i could get a cold pint glass of beer .
this place is amazing , j the owner is very friendly and can help you make a decision on the menu . since i found this place my fiancé and i have been coming back here every other day for smoothies and great wraps !
good beer , wine and mixed drinks and great service .
not to mention the decor and the bar is outstanding .
quick , good food at decent prices ?
it was very thick and disgustingly sweet .
lovely restaurant with attentive and pleasant staff .
i believe my total was about $ 7.00 .
towels everywhere , questionable fluids on the floor , just completely dirty .
it 's got some weird industrial theme going on , but it does n't feel too dirty .
we started by waiting 30-40 mins to be seated , not bad .
pretty expensive for a burger joint , nothing extraordinary on the menu . brisket meal was n't worth the $ 22 but it is vegas
came for dinner new year 's eve with friends and had a great meal .
overrated . very expensive , very average food .
they also only have beer , no wine at all .
the food is outstanding ! pastas , fish , it 's all authentic and delicious .
our normal server was out sick so idk who they got to cover .
it is the most expensive buffet you are going to find in vegas and probably anywhere at $ 50 before 3pm and then it jumps to $ 60 after 3pm .
grilled cheese on it 's own is already amazing . the entree comes with a summer salad that is just as wonderful -- the fruits and dressing all go so well together with the veggies .
there 's a surge of new boba spots opening up lately !
the beer is cold and i have mixed drinks about feelings .
the service is also pretty good for a place with such low prices .
beers were not even close to full and wine poor was average .
this is probably a pretty basic selection of thai food , and like i said , it all tasted good .
no music playing , no one talking , somewhat uncomfortable feeling .
something to keep in mind : a giant steak burrito at chipotle is $ 7.50 , but at foosia you should expect to pay a couple dollars more , granted , for a healthier food item .
prices are too high for alcohol and food .
the four of us each had a drink beehive ( came in a mason jar ) , moscow mule , & blueberry something- all awesome .
pretty hipster vibe overall , but really enjoyed it .
not a good place for wine , but about 30 draft beers .
food is good as well drink and reasonably priced .
the only thing i do n't like as much is the décor ( except the hanging lights ) .
pretty good but not worth the price
the bathroom is in serious need of an update and lighting .
if i had paid the dinner price i may had been upset but at lunch it only costs $ 10 .
good food , reasonable prices and nice ambiance .
nice , almost swanky but casual setting instead of the predictable sports bar concept .
do n't use the bathroom and do n't expect a clean interior .
i had a brickworks cider which was light and refreshing .
that was kind of creepy .
the food was amazing and served hot .
every time we leave , we talk about how rude the counter staff is .
draft beer was not as cold as it should be , order bottles . crappy music .
great cocktails , but no draft beer . need i say more ?
the unlimited beer/wine was nice , but there was only one craft beer on tap , which was disappointing .
sad that men do n't have enough manners to remove their hats , hence the sign telling you that your parents failed .
the bartender did n't know the beers they had on tap and seemed pretty out of it .
i do n't eat cheesecake and when i ask the man ... hmm i mean apathetic adolescent behind the counter which cheesecake he 'd recommend he seemed a little annoyed by my question and without looking at me said he did n't like cheesecake .
goes without saying this place will be my new lunch go to for sure !
i love this place , when you walk in you get that awesome feeling like you just walked in to a family members house .
i had the shrimp and scallop combo with fries and gravy - i love gravy on the fries !
the soups are wonderful and the desserts and absolutely delicious .
unfortunately he was disappointed because the beer taps were frozen and they could n't pour and beers !
however , the appetizers i ordered were average at best . the guacamole was very bland .
the presentation of the chive & ricotta gnocchi was not very appetizing , but tasted decent and the charcuterie board was mediocre - it did n't really standout from any other board .
i came in here with a broken ipad mini and they only charged me $ 100 , which is way cheaper than other repair shops that charge you about $ 200+ .
i was pleased that the buffet came with open bar ( on select beer & wine ) .
the hostess , although very nice , seemed overwhelmed . good food for the money , but oftentimes too crowded .
very friendly and courteous people .
it was ok. not sure i was a fan of the pretzel crust or the onion dip that came along with them , but ... they were alright .
the backyard patio is peaceful and charming .
and the price is great .
i really like the chicken korma and do n't forget the garlic naan .
recommend sitting on the deck , the live band provided great atmosphere .
prices are very reasonable .
the food is delicious and the atmosphere is relaxed .
this disgusted me so much ( more for the lack of caring on the part of management than the actual dirt itself ) that i am going to get our group to meet elsewhere .
somewhat full bar not just beer and wine they do have liquor as well .
i do n't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine .
i indulged in an italian greyhound cocktail - light and refreshing .
the only let down was that there was no beer on tap .
i did not ask for any special tequila .
the food is really reasonably priced , and it 's a great atmosphere .
good ambience , which is what you pay for .
even though we had a party of 20 the food arrived correctly and hot . our server , will , was on top of it .
i highly recommend this place !
the drink menu was extensive with a lot of unique margaritas .
the prices are very reasonable for lunch .
the only thing that was remotely the way i liked wad the egg .
the place was pretty busy- sunday night at dinner time .
waitress really peppy and attentive .
the place seemed nice , but i do n't understand the whole dim lighting thing in restaurants .
drinks were a little weak but draft beers worked well enough .
not sure who came up with the whacked cocktail menu but fortunately they have a good selection of craft beer on tap .
that is significantly lower in price .
they did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it 's not all about crappy beer .
recommended a seasonal ipa and i loved it . my girlfriend loved her dw margarita , i hustled a few sips .
what a great place ! i work nearby and have been to zoe 's two times this week .
and it 's pretty cheap !
i did n't see one decent beer on tap or in the coolers .
of course , the pizza is fantastic as well .
instead of seating the customer himself this manager decided it would be more important to seat a single customer .
the decor was very nice , but cluttered with flags and other strange things .
the price is relatively good , in the $ 10- $ 15 range you would expect .
the meat was mediocre at best . the sandwhich sucked .
disappointing all around . beer was ho-hum .
this is by far our favorite restaurant in the valley .
sat at the bar , ordered a cold negro modelo - they only offer it on draft .
the chicken has great taste , the sauce is flavorful and has a southern soulful flavor .
however , the service was absolutely horrible , which is unacceptable if you 're paying $ 30 per person .
the ceiling tiles are in bad shape , with lots broken and stained . the whole ceiling looks bad .
it is not cheap but the food is good quality .
$ 30 for 2 people seems high for what they offer .
very nice new owners , they also will do half rolls which is totally nice ! sushi is fresh !
the staff was vey pushy when i was looking over the menu and no one even waiting behind me , in fact there was only one other person in the store .
brunch will run you a little over $ 30 per person which , honestly , you 're mostly paying for is the name `` bellagio '' .
two out of the four meals were ok but two were pretty bad .
i get the transaction was n't through them but the mistake was all them and the attitude was horrible .
first impressions : dark but intimate lighting ; nice ambiance ; a bit loud ; smells yummy .
not classy , i know .
( too bad i got take out ) the lighting is quite dim .
not too sweet , refreshing , and not a lot of alcohol .
my mojito was flavorful , but not strong .
pretty decent prices , too .
it 's kind of awkward .
the service is inexperienced still .
after rolling by a ton of places lit up with fancy signs and neon lights , pulled up to this restaurant not expecting much . how wrong was i .
my panini was okay , but had a weird after taste .
i would n't eat here everyday , but i definitely plan to return .
i examined it closely and sure enough it was one .
the pretzel was bland and somewhat hard . the cheese dip was okay .
the flavor was fine , but a little bland , and there was not much in the way of chicken or shrimp .
my favorite soup i 've ever had is here : the jamaican chicken curry soup . it 's a neon green like teenage mutant ninja turtle ooze , but has consistently had a perfect flavor .
great place to sit on a quiet patio for breakfast/brunch .
all the food is delicious .
place was pretty busy and the wait staff was keeping everyone happy and cheery .
you would never guess that this gorgeous outdoor space was hidden in this area .
i asked for a reason because i was just tired and not drunk but they offered no explanation .
the beer menu was pretty weak . they did n't have much on tap and the bottle selection was just as poor .
nice , relaxing decorations .
very slow service so do n't go when you are in a hurry . the food is okay .
everything i ever had here is super legit . the bronzino is for champions .
the prices are reasonable . the drinks are made well .
my girlfriend and i were really excited to try the burgers here .
its true it has a nice atmosphere . kind of a cozy place and has the `` feel '' of a french bistro .
the menu boasted flash fried corned beef ( sounded delicious ) , but the corned beef on the sandwich lacked any flavor and the person i was with thought it was mushy . the bread was the worst part of the sandwich - it tasted bad .
highly recommend the calamari and the evil jungle princess ( beef ) .
the mojito was right on point !
the chicken dish tasted like it was something that you pick up in the frozen food aisle of the grocery store .
the customer service was great as well !
seriously they were like dried paper .
i want to say the meatball is around 23 bucks or something so if you had a couple drinks and the meatball you could get out of here for less than 50 $ per person which is vegas is pretty cheap and the atmosphere is def upscale .
good food but terrible service .
even though it was lunch time i had a vesper martini which was good .
on the other hand though , their breakfast menu is pretty cheap and reasonable .
loved the lobster blta - it was a great mix of flavor ! the chop chop salad was also tasty and served in a large portion - had enough for a snack that night !
very good falafel ! not fried to death and dry , but moist and flavorful !
we paid approximately $ 90 including tip for 2 entrees , and 2 drinks which is pretty unreasonable for a fast food chain restaurant .
do n't come here expecting intimate conversation - the music is always blaring . other than that , the food is cheap and delicious ( especially the donuts ) .
the server we had was also very rude .
great place to take your girlfriend for dessert and chocolatey martinis .
the cost winds up being $ 15 - $ 20 per person for a full meal .
everyone had a great dinner .
it 's my burger fix , not only are the burgers great , the fries are awesome and topped with a bubblegum milkshake . there are lots of menu options , i also enjoyed the beef dip here , and fish and chips .
cute coffee place , this place can get a bit crowded .
nice atmosphere on a sunday evening on the patio .
the servers were very nice and prompt , the wait was n't too bad but it would be great if they could fit in more chairs or put benches outside .
do n't delay on trying this restaurant out ! you wo n't be disappointed !
the beer order was wrong ( after we told her the correct one 3 times and she still kept getting them confused ) and she then asks if it would still be ok to take the wrong one , we responded no .
it was a large open area which was nice and unlimited beer and wine although no one in our party really drinks .
location is slightly awkward inside with bad lighting but not too bad .
the cheese ravioli ( with meatballs ) is also a good choice and it comes with a side of garlic bread .
the staff here are always nice and around when you need them .
the breading appeared thicker than i normally like , but the squid was fresh and it was tasty .
the layout is kind of odd though .
great wine and menu .
a little pricey but you do pay for the nice ambience .
i know they were arguing because they got my order wrong which they did make right immediately but i felt bad that they were yelling at each other .
the skewers are decently sized and pretty cheap at $ 1.50 each , and a whole pitcher of beer is only $ 7 which is the cheapest i 've ever seen in toronto .
my friend and i both got sparkling lemonades and they were amazing .
i enjoyed a mango tango mojito and loved it ... super tasty and went down way too smooth ! nice atmosphere , friendly bartenders and a great , extensive cocktail menu .
the crab puffs were deliciously warm and creamy with a light sweet and sour .
just a heads up they do n't have liquor , only wine and beer .
i ordered the chicken pad thai which i usually do and even though it still tasted delicious , quantity has reduced significantly . i was starving before i got here and was quite disappointed .
when drunk , finding the bathroom at remedy 's is like a mini maze .
the price itself is a bit shocking .
the service was really good . the food was hot and fresh.. the price was reasonable .
decent pizza place , but they are kind of the worst with up charges if you order online ?
the carpet in the hallways was pretty dirty , and the wallpaper scraped up . the room was modern , but too dark and lighting was definitely desired .
eddie makes the best sushi and always greats us when we arrive . he remembers details about our family and makes us feel welcome .
the lounge space they set us up in was perfect and spacious , great for an event .
this is one of my friends ' go-tos for after work cool downs .
the prices were also reasonable .
nice decor on inside .
i 'm so mad they have $ 16 of my money .
if you hate waiting , be content with the fact that you wo n't be the only one waiting .
food was amazing . fast , friendly , and comfortable restaurant .
their sushi is cheap , in small portions , and well its cheap !
the pork meat was so dry , and the corn part was kind of dry as well .
the ribeye , chicken and pork were high quality and the sake was the perfect addition to the meal .
well drinks are pretty weak , so i stick to beers .
the meat was smelly and food was not delicious . i ordered tempura shrimp for a starter but it was fried in a very old oil and it was horrible tasting .
and they have some good beers for the pitcher not .
gave 4 stars because the decor was too boring and lighting was too bright .
this place is great !
not a single `` sorry '' , or apologize for overlooking our order . we even came in thinking we 'd get better customer service , but we did n't .
i would suggest : lobster mashed potatoes crab crab cakes black truffle gnocchi chilean sea bass if you want a fancy dinner and you 're dressed to impress , this would be a lovely place to hit up .
the price is reasonable .
i tried three drinks , including the mint apple , one with blue curacao and lychee ( delicious ! )
whether for dinner , happy hour or margarita mondays , this place will not disappoint !
it was one of the tastiest fried chicken i ever had . the chicken i believe was marinated and so juicy and flavourful and the skin was nice and crispy .
not worth the price sorry .
the only burger i spent more than $ 30 on .
excellent dogs and sensational homemade chips great additions included in price .
from the tremendous clutter of all the weird decor to some odd items like a statue of a topless women ?
not having beer descriptions in a beer bar is just wrong .
the sushi here is absolutely delicious .
my bad , i should have checked but please explain to me why the chicken , steak and shrimp were so over cooked and dry ?
and so reasonably priced !
i would definitely dine here again . great food , service , and atmosphere .
the prices are reasonable for the quality of food . the tacos are okay .
service was great and prices reasonable .
the service is fast and the staff is friendly .
service was spot on . food was great .
the fried pickles were fantastic .
they have a lot of beers on tap but i got a weird look when i asked for a beer list .
perfect match of flavor and texture .
stemmed like a typical bar with too many beers available , but did have my lame beer if choice coors light .
i do n't mind paying good money for a great meal . but not good for the price .
pretty authentic , and reasonably priced .
horrible lighting , very cute painting on wall , the food is not bad , but for the price ... it should be better .
the waitress was nice and we did n't have to wait long for the check .
service is decent . price is reasonable .
anyway , i took advantage of the happy hour beer specials , but unfortunately i really hated the second beer ( something by deschutes that i think might have been skunked ) .
my only complaint is the place is a bit loud .
i have tried numerous items including cannoli , cookies , cake , and their highly touted pizza .
there were a few people out in the patio area , but we were the only people dining indoors .
craft beers were about 5-6 which is n't too bad .
the food here is very reasonably priced .
( good thing the pizza was n't hot i guess . )
nate and the staff was wonderful .
the food was good , but my dish arrived cold .
tiny dance floor , no seating for dancers , lighting wrong , atmosphere `` created in haste '' , bad , bad , bad .
even the margaritas were bad ( pre-mixed ) .
to be honest we stopped coming because the service and a particular waitress was just so rude .
entrance is kind of odd , just a heads up .
not that i drink beer but they have huge beer selection , over a 130 beers on tap .
the servers were very attentive and the customer service was great- the restaurant manager greeted us as well and immediately took care of my undercooked pasta situation and took it off my bill .
they are also giving samples of a garlic dip for french fries and that was pretty great too .
explained it was most likely an issue of over seasoning on the `` line . ''
in addition to thin crust , wood-fired pizza , the salads , sauces and bread are outstanding . the owner mans the pizza oven and the wait staff is as top notch as the food .
burger had no real outstanding flavor that makes it great .
atmosphere is nothing special , just tucked in an office building lobby , but the food makes up for it .
came to around $ 22 cad which for airports is n't that bad .
the bed was hard as a rock and the bathroom had ugly overhead fluorescent lighting and could have easily been a bathroom at a mediocre motel .
all the bad bbq my wife ordered was soaked in awful bbq sauce to hide the crap .
i gave it 4 stars cause of the food . only reason why i did n't give it a 5 was because the customer service was awful .
had a lobster mac and cheese for appetizer which looked good but ended up having a bland flavor .
the lighting inside is very dim , to the point of almost using my cell phone light to read the menu .
the cake was stale and hard .
the quail was fantastic ! 3. entree - i thought the entrees was very good .
the inside of the restaurant was pretty big with an upscale casual vibe and cool decorations .
i had the chef special and a glass of moscato .
portions were served family style and a lot of it , veg was awesome and who knew so many types of beets existed .
they always have exotic beverages here , like desert pear , pomegranate , or chipotle pineapple lemonade , margaritas , and mojitos . refreshing and trendy !
it was very nice . i really liked the fact that the '' candied '' walnuts were not heavily crusted in sugar .
gave 4 stars because the decor was too boring and lighting was too bright .
it was reasonably priced too !
the quality of the wines is outstanding at very reasonable prices .
choice of beers was n't to bad .
i also got the drink between you & me which was a light , fruity concoction .
but expect to pay its a bit pricey for dinner try the lunch menu its a bit more reasonable .
the floor was wet and dirty , and no tp or paper towels in the women 's room .
prices are very reasonable .
sure enough happy hour was a go !
not sure why some say the decor was upscale .
we had some strong and spicy grapefruit drink , some vodka drinks and then ended up sharing whatever giant bowl is meant for two .
we sat at the bar and i had a moscow mule which was great - one of the better versions i 've had !
it came out to be around $ 50 per person including tip , which wouldve been fine if the food was amazing .
also , you ca n't come here without trying one of their delicious cocktails ( i had one with a rum created by the restaurant ) - so yummy !
the breading was heavy and once it got cold , it did n't taste very good .
the margarita was n't anything special either .
pool area is a really sad place .
they have a good tequila list though i was n't drinking tonight .
puke under tables , women 's bathroom horrible , smell , glasses in sink ... .
they had a great deal on some bottles of wines , so we split a bottle and i was happy with our choice .
seemed that the margaritas were the specialty but was not impressed , plus it came in a beer pint glass.. ?
very glad i found this place !
love them ! must try !
the prices are decent .
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
i had a tall beer on draft , and some nachos which were actually pretty good .
we asked what was in the margaritas as in what kind of tequila and the bartender responded `` everything is tequila based like every margarita '' .
i mean , i guess the decor makes it upscale ?
they are cheap and good .
third member had margarita chicken that was dried out and tough .
it was very clean and everyone is so nice .
i was a bit disappointed that the waiter did n't come to fill up our glasses until i asked them to do so .
their pizzas are delicious .
the waiter mentioned that they let the sangria sit a few days to allow the fruity flavors to come out , quite delicious .
i found the hostess to be a bit short , she was clearly overwhelmed but honestly , that should not affect how she treats people .
everyone is very pleasant that works there .
reasonably priced and good value for money .
the food is disgusting and cold here .
thought the name meant beer or good drinks . beers were pricey .
but when we wiped off the peppers , they were more doable - if only they did n't smell like fish bellies , they might have been ok. the beef chow mein however stinks so bad no one would touch it .
so disappointing . they get 2 stars for a clean space and efficient service , but only someone who has never had good authentic roti would think that oily mushy mess of potato , bland curry and meager servings of shrimp in one case , chicken in the other ( barely discernible ) was good .
cheap too , which is nice .
the room was mediocre at best . the floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded .
serving staff was nice .
amazing ! we 're from seattle and used to great sushi so it takes a lot to impress us- we 're impressed !
lunch menu is pretty standard and decently priced
it was a deliciously sweet drink .
honestly , it was pretty tasteless and forgettable .
this location is very clean and friendly .
every single item ordered was delicious , containing fresh ingredients , and generous portions for the price .
sake wine was good , too !
this was great . clean !
be prepared for loud noises coming from all corners of the building , live music sounding all around ... and there 's a slide to keep hyper kids busy while you eat !
the drinks are also amazing .
windows open for a nice breeze . blood mary special and football is a great way to start a sunday .
the duck and pear is also another favorite of ours , all on spelt crust which is a great option .
only downside , they switched our beers at table , but all beer is good beer anyway .
service is superb and the wine list and drinks are great .
it was tasty but not worth the $ 27 for the plate . the sushi was mediocre nothing special .
the total bill was $ 40 which is really high all considering for lunch .
the 3 dipping sauces for my filet were worthy of an equal division of attention and the table to the rights ordering of a $ 700 glass of scotch wad a nice touch .
just beware of the bathroom , it 's a little bit creepy .
if you do n't mind spending $ 10 for a burger lunch , this place is great .
our servers are always friendly and our food is cooked to perfection . great branch of primanti 's !
i absolutely love mother 's dumpling ! they have some great options for vegetarians and prices are good !
and the ranch that came with had a really sour , nasty taste to it .
reasonably priced also . love it .
i 've had pretty good experiences so far , so when me and my date were looking for a dinner option on a recent saturday night , i suggested having dinner here .
i do n't know if they were out or if they even offer that normally .
prices are just plain ridiculous .
i did n't try the beer , but it looked like decent alcohol choices .
what little i did taste was bland and unflavorful ( nothing a little salt and ketchup ca n't fix ) .
met a friend here during happy hour and was pleasantly impressed with the ambiance despite being in a mall .
the place is nothing fancy ; it 's a sports bar . so if you are looking for a place to drink and shoot some pool this would be a great place for you .
i 've been to blue 32 three times now ( twice at this location ) and i 've been impressed every time .
off the wall food , with good taste and an amazingly good price . a college town needs a good place to score cheap food , with cheap drinks .
i also ordered the sangria which i was not happy with at all and i usually love sangria .
weird that the men 's one person bathroom has a big gap in the door .
great atmosphere . cozy little place .
the price is very reasonable too .
the satay is done perfectly with beef or chicken and a peanut sauce .
in the span of 15 minutes , we were asked 5 different times by 5 different servers what we 'd like to drink . when we finally got our drinks , we experienced a similar situation with the food order .
pretty decor , but we found the lighting odd .
server was very nice . restaurant was nice and clean .
prices are great too .
was n't offered any water or chips while waiting so i missed all the hospitality everyone else received in these reviews . when the order arrived , i received a smile and a sorry .
there is plenty of seating , and the restaurant is well lit by natural light during the day .
great menu and portion sizes .
food was amazing and great drink specials !
great service and attentive staff .
the menu looked good , we thought the beer selection was good , especially having 12 draft beers .
i was so extremely disappointed . not only was all three pizzas i ordered burnt , so was everyone else in the restaurant .
what bar does n't have coors light ? did not have it in bottle or draft .
went during happy hour and found that the happy hour menu was eliminated and the drinks were no bargain .
it 's just `` good '' . i will say that the avocado smoothie here tasted like i was drinking liquid cardboard lol .
my steak was n't the best , considering the $ $ $ i paid . many others had a very good experience .
delicious but over priced .
their rooftop patio is unique in all of downtown !
prices are very reasonable as well .
overall , the layout of the restaurant is pretty cute .
the prices are very reasonable .
the lighting inside is very dim , to the point of almost using my cell phone light to read the menu .
nice variety of cocktails and wine . excellent espresso .
no margaritas . just beer and wine : -/ what 's a girl to do .
everything was pretty good except they use the tiniest little burger patties .
the service is good and the drinks are reasonably priced especially for the area .
the kind hostesses reread our order to make sure everything was correct and went in the back to get us even more peanut sauce .
they are pretty good and reasonably priced .
the price is reasonable too .
great live music ! nice atmosphere and staff .
soup was normal nothing special cause is probably just boiled water with vege and meat .
and they have great drinks .
it was marinated in a strong ponzu sauce and basically took on that flavor with a very gelatinous texture .
clean and great staff !
we will keep going there and will start enjoying the patio again come november ... .lol keep up the good work guys .
i would go here more often if the prices were n't so high . $ 16 for a lunch is more than i care to spend everyday .
it is right on mill avenue and the outdoor seating is a great place .
you wo n't be disappointed !
not really expensive either .
over priced and they serve you a coffee that is not full to the brim and charge $ 13 for it .
definitely a $ - 1 dollar sign ; not sure why someone put four dollar signs .
i 'm sad to realize , only because i 'm moving out of vegas next week , that i had n't found this place sooner .
i did n't see one decent beer on tap or in the coolers .
the prices are reasonable as well .
the value for the money was outstanding , and the 30 minute wait on a sunday to get seated reflected it .
waiter got snotty when i asked to take back the cold enchiladas that were cold because he was helping an old couple figure out the pay at the table machine for 10 minutes !
like for real , it 's almost creepy .
the ac was pretty loud though and the interior design looked a little out dated but it 's tolerable and not much of an eye sore .
this would be ideal for a small study group , book club , or just a spot to meet up .
i was looking for a light appetizer with a great glass of wine .
if the special is advertised as being $ 5 ... then charge me $ 5 .
in my opinion , it didnt really taste like matcha so i was a bit disappointed but i like how it wasnt overly sweet . the mango drink was interesting because it was sour but it had an after taste ( like an artificial taste ) .
atmosphere is casual but very nice , food is great . service is good as the wait staff checked on us quite often .
perhaps it was an old batch but not impressed with either items . too dry .
the atmosphere was great , with a beautiful view of the golf course 's first tee .
the spicy beef salad was also yummy . beef was tender and dressing on the salad had a nice heat , nothing too overwhelming .
a dish + a cold drink is about $ 7 total which is a really good price if you 're looking for a cheap , tasty and filling lunch .
it is expensive for a $ 10 combo .
the soup was not terrible but it was not a lick the bowl good either .
the hot sauce had no taste , and the soup was n't overly msg like .
i noticed a decent beer selection but was disappointed to hear that they had no drink specials .
you 're not paying for bad quality food , it is delicious despite the price !
hard to beat for the price !
the chairs are kind of weird ... all metal , but that 's to go with the theme i suppose .
they have a pretty good beer list , though nothing on draft .
great sushi ! always so fresh and a wonderful little place to go out with a friend , boyfriend or family member .
could n't wait to try this restaurant with its weird name and kitschy deco .
went somewhere else . the food we did get was good .
the prices are so very reasonable too .
it included all items on the menu even from the kitchen and bud light and saki .
one of my favorite and must go to stops when visiting ohio city .
i am not interested in returning as once i have a perception of a person , place or thing any follow up experience would be tainted and would be unfair to try as i would not want to add negativity towards your restaurant .
sorry but i agree with the price of a taco for $ 7 .
the potato skins and peperoni rolls are great .
not expensive but a little annoying .
dinner for two was $ 25 , i would say that 's a pretty good deal !
the sangria by the pitcher is awesome !
ironically , martinis are $ 11 , which is 2 shots of alcohol typically , so the math does n't add up and the gouging is surely chasing away business .
nice wine selection as well .
i had the dragon roll and it was great !
great food . reasonable prices .
the food is dirt cheap and very good .
place was on point , service was great , food was too , top notch expierence , went for a private xmas company party , and they had no problem accommodating us , ( 30+ ) , we totally booked in advance too ( please dont expect to walk in with 30+ unannounced '' ) tho i bet you they would have problem if you did .
i was a bit disappointed that they did n't have draught beer but enjoyed the selection of cans and bottles .
it was barely warm , and it tasted like it had been microwaved .
food is ok , the server , laurie never bothered to ask us to tell our drinks and forgot our chips and guacamole and did n't take it off our bill . i told her she never have is chips and guacamole and she said `` oh sorry '' .
got the chicken cutlet wanted curry sauce nope i got a salty thick gravy ... . cutlet was so over cook the meat looked plastic .
a good price at $ 2 a piece as well .
we often only spend about $ 40 on sushi .
both were tremendous . second time we had some appetizers which were equally good .
good drinks but very strong .
and even though the hallways scream 1960s , i even liked the low ceilings because i 've never felt so tall .
as it was my first time there , had a good welcome by staff of carlos ' n charlie 's .
would 've liked to see some drafts but nonetheless , the bottled beer selection was great .
it was kind of strange tasting .
i honestly could eat grimaldi 's multiple times a week and never get tired of it !
we ordered i believe 7 dishes for a total of just under $ 60 .
restaurant was only at 20 % capacity so there must be some management issue .
rather tasteless . the crust was ok , the sausage really had very little flavor .
first of all it was ridiculous expensive ... 2 large pizza 's and wings $ 55.00 .
great margarita for a night cap as well !
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
cool atmosphere to just chill , hang out and people watch . the frozen hot chocolate is yummy .
everything was super white and shiny with marble tables ... so it kind of felt like i was in a washroom .
the food comes in huge portions .
i picked at it , and hardly ate it .
we ordered a pitcher of pear margarita , and although i am not a huge margarita fan , this concoction was good and i certainly had my share . we also ordered the appetizer sampler .
the only not great thing was the margarita which seemed over-priced with a poor pour of tequila .
the beer list was disappointing .
the rice on the rolls had a weird texture to them .
nice wine list and cocktails list as well .
at $ 60 per person , it does n't even equate to a good value compared to eating at some of the finer dining establishments .
the desserts were just ok , and the service was appalling .
they are strong , high quality , and reasonably priced .
i had the chicken parmesan and was sad that i could n't finish it all .
the combination of the flavours went together perfectly .
my wife had le thai noodles chef special which was also very good .
we were in town for 3 nights staying very near lbs .
this is always a great place to bring the family when they are in town .
that is $ 10 for an entire stash .
after being contacted by the manager , i 'm adding two stars because they addressed the issue ( hostess ) with me , but more importantly with her .
all great . cheap prices .
the service was good and prices reasonable .
good food at the cheap price .
my friend was furious and i was appalled by the discourteous service this waitress gave us .
the food was hot . a little too hot as the food was sticking to the bottom of the plastic containers it was held in .
i would recommend the district - kind of a arnold palmer sweetened with prickly pear juice .
food was so so . drinks were delish - love their bellinis .
the food is alright , the beer is cheap .
however , they play the f*cking music so loud that it 's almost impossible to have a conversation .
the donut is fluffy and fresh , with a wonderful balance of frosting .
everything was tasty and cooked perfectly .
the bottled beer was nice and cold but my friend thought the tap beer was not nearly cold enough .
the burrito is very large , a great deal for $ 4.99 .
the prices were very reasonable for the quality .
everything i have ever ordered has been fantastic wings , cheese sticks , subs , pasta dishes .
regardless the inside was just as cute and cozy .
everything is cooked to order , and the fresh fish is always excellent .
i asked for a blended margarita and was told they only do on the rocks . what kind of bar does n't have a blender ?
was in town for business quickly and this place had a ton of great reviews , that they certainly lives up to . i recommend stopping in here for lunch and grabbing just about anything on the menu !
they only have four beers on tap , everything else was bottles .
ambiance and location are good .
food prices are cheap .
the men 's bathroom weirdly enough had a really high urinal . was a little unsettling actually , but restroom was clean .
the service was fantastic ( sat at the bar ) and all the important details were attended to . had a glass of amazing zin .
beer wise , stick to bottles .
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
i did not ask for any special tequila .
i do n't drink but they had a huge selection of wine and beer .
we were each served with three different shots of sake to go along with the meal .
i absolutely love this place .
but the grilled chicken breast and hyderabadi biryani is the best that i have had in north america .
price wise , i 'd say it 's about average with the desserts being about $ 6 .
some of us ordered the specialty drinks while others went off menu , so everything from a fancy martini to a basic gin and tonic were all balanced perfectly .
3 ) their scrambles are always delicious .
i ordered a terrific house side salad and i combined 2 specialty pizzas into a 1/2 and 1/2 .
pork buns and chicken wings were quite good . i especially liked the spicy chicken wings , it 's juicy and spicy .
sorry i am not paying $ 25 for a half full lunch when the food court gives a full meal , equal quality meal for 1/3 of the price .
i was not disappointed .
yes you can get expensive items on a buffet on the strip , but the cost is 3x what you will pay here .
bathroom is a decent size ... .the full length mirror in the bathroom is really nice , but they do n't have any other mirrors in the room other than the two in the bathroom ... ..which was weird ... .
it took a little longer than expected , so once we noticed people that ordered after us got there food we spoke up . once they realized they accidentally skipped us they immediately apologized and worked hard to make our food as soon as possible .
that 's cool - unless you write `` freaky fast '' all over your walls ; - )
here 's my impression : decor : pretty sterile and unwelcoming .
the cheesecake was attractive , but the texture was kinda spongey and dry and weird .
the restaurant itself is very clean and hip looking .
gorgeous ambiance and happy hour ! love the food and drink cocktails are each special !
i thought it was fine , but nothing special .
everything was amazing , from the craft cocktails , to the bruschetta , salad , burgers and wine list .
also , great price .
since we only ordered 2 entrees and it was $ 50+ too expensive and not enough food .
if you are looking to make a good impression with someone , whether it is a date or just your mom , you should bring the person to three birds in lakewood on a nice evening and sit on the patio .
the waitress then proceeded to say that she would be `` nice '' and bring the charge down to $ 6 since we were not aware of the fee .
amazing value for the low price point .
very good price for downtown .
the meat was yummy but everything else just seemed very mediocre .
however , they have excellent pulled pork , and the mac and cheese is really good , too .
it looks good but all these hard surfaces make it noisy , with sound bouncing around all over .
but there were other food items available like ramen , korean chicken fries , etc .
this is a nice cafe to relax and enjoy the various amount of items that are used to decorate the place . it makes for an ideal place of getting a drink while studying .
food is great and reasonably priced .
great selection on everything . it is $ 15 for all you can drink sangrias , beer , wine and mimosas .
we visited this place many times because it is so adorable : the place itself is lovely , great decor inside and a beautiful patio . the staff looks out of a fashion magazine : all of them are so good looking and hip that you end up feeling inadequate ( but this is a good thing though ) .
it was replaced with another draft beer that was n't that great either .
wine list was solid and we enjoyed a nice bottle of primitivo .
only gripes are the little details in the room were overlooked ... loose faucet handles , disgusting bath mat , moldy looking grout between bath tiles ... these really kept me from giving it 4 or 5 stars .
when the check was given to us it was wrong ... and if we 're paying 400 for dinner , i most definitely expect the check to be right .
great beer . great wine .
tough and full of fat and no taste !
i could n't imagine paying the full price of $ 22 and being happy !
the lighting is just absolutely horrific .
prices are reasonable as well .
my husband and i come here about twice a month and my friends and i recently starting coming for happy hour too .
the prices are great .
i highly recommend this restaurant .
arrive in time for happy hour prices and enjoy the best martini !
the staff was very courteous and helpful .
but it is only $ 19 and not $ 50 so i ca n't be too picky .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
prices were pretty reasonable as well .
it seems popular and the prices are good but i 'd rather spend my $ elsewhere .
reasonably priced , delicious food .
love it.. then i chose the rice pudding as dessert.. everything was great and elegant .
we ordered bottled beers -- their beer selection is good , i will give them that .
and did i mention that the margarita was very weak ? i think the bartender forgot the tequila .
be sure to go on a sunny day and sit on the roof top patio .
decent . not expensive .
the setup is nice , quiet ( during early hours ) , and cozy .
room was dirty , lots of hair , drips on ceiling while showering , bathroom sink did not drain at all , noisy , carpet was stained , room smelled badly of smoke , not sure how it 's actually non smoking .
food was really good and cheap .
minor cons - bathroom is pretty ghetto looking . it just needs more lighting and a working sensor on the paper towels .
cool atmosphere with farm to table style food .
the ambiance and dining experience was great though . the server was nice and patient and recommended some of his favourites .
definitely a happy hour not to be missed !
it was summertime when i visited this place and they had the window wall up . it was n't crowded at all so we were able to get a spot close to the windows .
i love the atmosphere .
not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses , that were more like scotch glasses , only knock .
and for almost $ 50 ? ridiculous .
we came on monday the 6th and were greeted by a nice young man who seated us in a booth .
i am rarely in the junction but take advantage when i am there .
beer was nice big but no cold glass .
nice view of mountains from bar . very nice patio
lastly , the chicken i friend in a pan had a weird film on it after i cooked it .
if you get the ci saves offer ( $ 15 for $ 30 ) this place is an excellent value .
complete boring place with no atmosphere or personality absolutely no pictures on any walls . boring !
not sure why there are 4 dollar signs here for 60 bucks we ate to our sushi hearts desire .
poor service and mediocre food .
my boyfriend and i ordered bottles of mgd beer , which is a pretty common beer .
disappointed in this especially considering the prices you pay at steak restaurants .
really reasonably priced as well
just a great place to sit down with your laptop and kill some time .
they were awesome , i apologized and said not to worry .
the shrimp was overly salty and the batter was bland . the sauce was n't even good .
the cocktails and wine list is yummy , the food is good , but not great .
carol the owner is awesome and the staff has the best customer service around !
6 pack for 19 bucks is n't horrible for beer .
the first glace is cute , what girl does n't like hearts and bright colors ?
a lot of the decor looked kinda cheap and like it would look much better in dim lighting .
prices are very fair .
we sat at the bar and were greeted right away .
the 2 bottled beers were quite good though .
they 'd be okay hot with a good sauce but they were hard to eat on their own .
our guacamole was good and had expensive ingredients , however it cost $ 18 , and tacos are about $ 7 each so i thought it was a lot .
it is the perfect mix of classy and cozy that makes it perfect for either a date or a dinner with family and friend .
they cook it fresh and hot .
i got the classic pizza and it was n't my personal favorite ... but my husband got the lobster & shrimp mac and cheese and we give it two huge thumbs up !
nice restaurant with ordinary indoor looking but great outdoor environment . they have more tables in the backyard than indoor !
we ordered all of the vegetables and they were all disappointing with the exception of the potatoes .
the outside dining is very casual and charming .
i heard this place was amazing .
great wine as well .
baked ziti is ok but kind of dry not good for take home .
they do n't give a crap about service .
food is reasonably priced for a sit-down restaurant .
the chicken was warm and crispy and flavored well .
minimalist interior , i mean seriously .
tried the three taco plate with shrimp , brisket and pork . all were delicious , but i will be insisting my friends try the brisket .
the food is amazing -- burgers , sandwiches , salads , pizza , gelato , desserts , and beer/wine .
plus , the prices are very reasonable .
there is a big salad bar with all kinds of good things and there are plenty of other kinds of meat that they bring around to your table including chicken , pork , and lamb .
this was my first time staying off the strip and i was n't sure i 'd enjoy being away from the hustle and bustle of vegas but the pool area was so relaxed and clean and the casino area was great .
but dust , tacky wall art and poorly patched booth seats just ruin the ambiance .
the lighting leading up is pretty poor as well .
i think there were circumstances that made some of their wait staff unavailable for a bit but it was still unfortunate .
i got a sake bomb for $ 5 and was very happy with the service .
only bottled beer , nothing on tap was a bit of a downer .
it was absolutely disgusting .
the spa is very clean and the staff was super friendly .
i usually get the omelet breakfast which comes with your choice of ingredients , hash browns and two pancakes . it 's the perfect combination of savory and sweet .
the decor is a little tired , hole in the wall - but not horribly off putting .
the bathroom is in serious need of an update and lighting .
the pint and a pound are a great value . the prices are reasonable and portions more than adequate .
notable was that the waiter never offered an apology or explanation which goes a long way to soothing a customer who is unhappy .
it took them two minutes to bring out a replacement , but it was still cold inside .
chicken madras was extremely salty and dry even though it was drenched in sauce .
the bright lights of the place kept any sort of rowdiness down .
the pricing is n't bad either .
our tablecloth was already dirty when we sat down for the 1st time . there was fallen meat around our table .
enjoyable , especially in the company of others , as i was n't really looking to be crying in my corner of the couch the whole meal .
service was awful and bordered on rude .
was a great meal for 4 , around $ 10- $ 12 a person once you break it down .
great music . great for a night out with friends .
it appeared the waiters were busing their own tables , which makes zero sense .
nice food , reasonably priced .
the presentation was beautiful and the icing was perfectly balanced and the flavor of the cake was excellent .
man i love this location .
the peach crepes are my favorite and are stuffed and drizzled with caramel and almonds .
i 've also had their sandwiches and pizzas ( the bbq chicken 's pretty good ) and been satisfied with whatever choice i make .
their prices are quite reasonable with spending about $ 10 each time .
you wo n't be disappointed .
bad idea ! margaritas were ok but not booze in them !
it 's certainly too expensive for the quality plus the tip that you need to pay at this place .
the purpose of paying high dollar is that the quality was supposed to be higher .
pricing is also fair .
draft beer selection was not extensive , but they offered tastings ( poured more than fairly ) and the beers they had were really good .
great help on wine selection and appetizers for happy hour !
the beer selection was decent for canned beers but the only had one brand on tap and the one i wanted was out .
music is loud , and combined with the people , it forms a incoherent droning sound that can make it difficult to understand what 's being said .
the food is excellent . the atmosphere and layout is top-notch .
plus , their happy hour drinks are out of this world .
try fattoush if you want real good hummus .
we were also impressed by their cocktails and wine selection .
to start the bottomless mimosas are $ 15 or $ 7 each , which personally is a little high .
the drink menu is impressive and many of the drinks come in very large mason jars .
we went on a wednesday , and were happy to hear it was half price wine bottle night !
i had the gin gin mule cocktail to start and the bartender has done a great job to create a refreshing blend of lime and ginger ale with an ice cube surrounding a mint leaf .
the potato salad and baked beans are also delicious .
first off , the entrance is kind of awkward .
i was extremely taken back by the service , the waiters were rather rude and it seemed like the customer 's time had absolutely no value . i would not recommend this restaurant to friends and family .
great food at very reasonable prices .
awesome food at a very reasonable price .
the first impression walking into the restaurant with all the graffiti and writing on the walls , not impressed .
good drink menu as well .
this is a great place to go to after work .
got it as a level 1. at first it was kind of bland and watery .
their sushi is amazing but you have to try their spicy noodle soup .
it was sweet with a small bite of alcohol at the end of my sips .
the wait staff will cater to your every need and will make sure your lunch or dinner is to your liking .
we chose to sit in the shaded area to avoid sunburn and when we asked to be moved to the sunny area because it got cold , they kept giving us the runaround about the chairs that were there were reserved and not available , when no one even showed up .
food is priced right .
the restaurant has an absurdly tacky interior . a shame , really .
beer selection was good , but a gastropub should have unique vessels for drinks . cider in a guinness pint glass is just ... .wrong .
food is delicious and reasonably price .
i tried the sesame chicken but it was like little rocks , my knife could n't cut them . i did n't mind the pepper steak but it was heavily seasoned and had a weird after taste .
the interior design is excellent , and the food is great .
do n't bother getting a bagel here . you 'll be disappointed .
the waitress did n't even look me in the eye when i asked her a question but tended to everyone else nicely , lol .
first let 's start with the drinks , the happy hour specials were 1/2 off all drinks ... all drinks ! i had a cocktail that was a beet infused vodka .
if you order the full roll , prices are $ 16 and $ 18 .
i 'm always afraid to go to this dd because they rarely get my order correct , so i rarely go as well .
a plethora of negative signs : `` bathrooms only for patrons . ''
while the service was good the food was not . shrimp scampi was bland .
do n't get me wrong , the food was great , but the restaurant itself was seriously lacking the df grandeur with it 's low tiled ceiling and lack of windows .
and the live music is always free .
there are a couple of different ramen choices as well as different entrees and sides .
i tasted a wing during the route home and it was dry , so i tasted two more after arriving home and all of the wings were dry .
i was interested in trying the deep fried boiled egg but it was n't that good . it was a little dry and over cooked .
the lighting and decoration or lack of give a cold sterile atmosphere .
i ordered a noodle dish that turns out to be very disgusting .
bright , quiet , spacious and clean .
cheapest of the cheap .
they were all very good and reasonably priced .
also prices are super reasonable .
the waiter came out and charged me the full price .
service both times was friendly and very quick , and the space is amazing -- open and bright with a great little stage .
it was a welcome departure from the noisy bar/restaurant atmosphere in most southside restaurants .
there was barely any chicken inside and the scoop of rice was minimal .
i came here for the first time the other day and i was pleasantly surprised .
men 's room was not even close to clean with tissues in shoved in all facilities and no paper towels or hand dryers and no hand soap .
the room was old and tiny which i could have dealt with too but the wallpaper in bathroom was filthy . the entire bathroom was dirty .
the host guy was funny to watch , but not at all effective in getting tables turned and seated , and seems to believe his low level job gives him a pass to be rude to customers .
theirs is very good and did n't give me any health issues associated with cheap food or chemicals ( headache , belly ache , etc ) .
it 's beyond bland .
following this we dealt with only the manager and only saw the waiter again for our bill .
not total hipster but it was just a weird setting .
upon ordering we asked if we could substitute simple items or add a biscuit on the side and those options were not available , even if we were willing to pay extra . a comment was made that if we sub or ask for things on the side the cook would be mad .
giving them two stars just coz the interior is sort of cute .
their thali meals are great value .
expensive lunch ( $ 78 which was the lunch , a glass of wine and iced tea ) but according to my husband , he 'd like to return he enjoyed it so much .
it was okay the interior decorations was very amusing .
plus the prices were quite fair .
everything on the menu is fairly priced .
the price you pay for a combo meal is higher than it used to be and more than you pay for lunch around town . it would be great if amados offered a lunch special .
i 'm glad i did because i could barely finish it with all the vegetables and rice that came with it .
the bright fluorescent lights indicate they have nothing to hide . the pho is incredible .
the house margarita was n't bad either .
the bartender started with a great manhattan then super recommendation on wine .
opting for the indoor main dining room experience was delightful .
indoor seating has nice , clean and comfortable chairs and couches . nice covered seating outside as well .
not sure why people rave about the margaritas , i think they either have no tequila , or it 's severly watered down .
if i could give this place a negative star i would ! horrible service !
the venue was comfortable , but loud .
chicken was tender but i didnt like the coating . over salted but what fried chicken is n't .
but only thing i did n't like was the lighting , it seemed kinda dark .
they looked very shiny , in a strange way , but not as if they were excessively greasy and tasted terrible .
this is a new restaurant in town and so it was packed for a week night as the town is starving for new and good dining options .
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
the waitresses were rude from beginning to end .
i do not order tap beer there , the selection is very weak anyway .
sad we waited so long to try it .
breakdown : decor : nicely done , made me feel comfortable , `` warehouse chique '' i guess you could call it .
reasonable prices on food and drinks .
the price for food was a little on the pricey side for what you get but that is probably what good ingredients cost .
i really enjoyed my experience .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
the decor , the glasses , the tablecloths i mean everything was identical .
the energy , lighting and cleanliness was awful .
ambience was a bit dark and sleepy . music a little too loud sometimes .
my sister also raved about how this place has really good ramen so we decided to go on the weekend .
i do find it amusing how `` hipster '' the establishment seeks to feel with tattooed employees and rustic decor ... yet much of the clientele is overtly b & t , sigh ( not dive 's fault ) .
in concept the idea seems classy . in practice it 's creepy .
delicious and a great value at $ 10.95 .
the entire bill was about $ 20 including tip so i 'd say it was priced pretty good .
overall : this place is great for a drive thru only , as i would n't recommend dining on the patio .
all were super tasty and authentic .
my fried chicken was cooked perfectly , and the mac and cheese is probably the best i 've ever had .
the server was very pleasant , helpful , and checked with us at the right times .
somewhat full bar not just beer and wine they do have liquor as well .
food is cheap and beer is cheap on weekdays .
if only the walls could talk .
the egg , chorizo and jalapeno peppers were cooked perfectly . great flavor with just the right amount of heat !
and had an attitude about putting the order in and was annoyed when we complained about the cold food .
bathroom ( singular ) were dingy but clean for the most part .
new hang out spot for las vegas locals for sure .
the beer tasted normal but at some $ 8 the price is getting up there .
the first drink they brought me was in a tall beer glass and was disgusting because it was premade syrupy , sugary margarita mix .
we had the burrata , lasagna and cannelloni . all were amazing !
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
unfortunately i had gorged myself in fondue so was unable to eat hardly any of it .
the bourbon list is fantastic , as well as the cocktails .
decent wine list and a good drink menu .
the price was decent compared to the more expensive ones at other 5* hotels on the strip .
the burger was pretty small for $ 20 .
we do n't mind spending $ $ $ on food , but it better be good .
everything i have had from here is excellent , the staff are friendly and have even gotten to know me over the past couple of weeks and memorized my order .
not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses , that were more like scotch glasses , only knock .
the food was great as always , but we felt a little shafted by our experience waiting in line for 20 minutes to be forgotten , and told an offer we thought existed would n't .
also a one off thing but the overhead light on the table was like a 10k watt surgical spotlight . it actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright .
but there 's not a whole lot of substance to hold up all that pretentious vibe .
their breads are right out of the oven . the cheeses are fresh and rich with flavor .
the only not great thing was the margarita which seemed over-priced with a poor pour of tequila .
decent price and quick service .
the paninis are all reasonably priced at around $ 7 each , and of very high quality , especially the meat .
even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it .
i do n't know how you mess up chicken fingers but they were dry and chewy .
my family and i were looking for a nice breakfast place .
let 's start with the seafood pancake , it had a good amount of seafood in it but it was thick and soggy .
it 's a very nice plants surrounding the tables .
the restaurant also had an extensive wine list with some very nice wines .
out suite had a washer and dryer , full kitchen great view and good view .
it was perfectly blended alongside the limoncello that they use as part of the margarita .
especially since they rushed the new plate out and the potatoes were completely under cooked and still raw .
the drink prices are fair , and the food is great !
the service was helpful , and the wine list could n't have been better . the napa cabernet by the glass is amazing !
the coconut drink is so refreshing as well .
cronuts - tasted great , but $ 36 for a dozen was steep , no discount for buying a whole dozen either .
people were comfortable , studying , and hanging out .
he was very nice and helpful .
there is a nice outside eating area with the nice lighting .
nice wine menu and yummy cocktails .
jig took some walls out etc n were left with a very large open space n the noise level is absurd .
i grabbed a chocolate croissant that was pretty darn delicious - basically it was a fresh croissant that was cut in half and there were chocolate chips inside ( or that 's what they looked like ) .
hipster vibe , minimalistic decor , a menu with about 10 good breakfast choices .
honestly just stick with the roasted pork and duck and you 're set !
there was nothing but crust in several spots , bland as hell , and lame .
the ambience and price points are hard to beat .
the bistro is larger than it looks & decorated nicely inside , but the food was the true star .
the modern decor is very trendy .
service was n't bad . there were no crutons in my chicken ceaser salad which i thought was odd .
i think the bartender may only be good at pouring beer .
to start with , we had to wait for 40mins before anyone approached us to take our order , which was ridiculous given that the restaurant was hardly crowded . we ordered 1 soup , 1 appetizer + 4 entrees and waited a further 35 mins post which a different waitress approached us and asked to place an order again !
prices are good also .
oh yeah ... did i mention how strong our drinks were ; - )
drinks were average ... i had a couple skinny margs and they tasted pretty watered down , nothing special .
this is not the kind of service one expects at a $ 75- $ 100 .
the vibe was trendy and fun with upbeat music and mood lighting .
it 's a brunch spot , a market , a craft cocktail bar , a sexy place to eat , and ( on weekends ) a dance club .
had the spicy tofu stew and wow , big winner , you should pick this !
i think the bartender may only be good at pouring beer .
girl at the register did n't know what she was doing and the entire atmosphere in the restaurant was tense !
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
the price for dinner is a lot more expensive then other dinner ayce .
the sangria is very refreshing .
no music , tired looking table & chairs .
unfortunately , they have no beers .
curry sauce was very bland and not spicy at all .
food was so tasty and the portions were a good size .
i love this place .
and that martini was pretty good and the bartenders were quite friendly .
pricing is extremely high for what it is .
weird decor and bad food .
the veggies on the side tasted just ok nothing special and flavorless .
now , it seems that $ 2 would not be a high price to pay for customer satisfaction , but it was too steep of a price to pay for the manager on duty that night .
good price for 10 wings at $ 8 , available in medium or hot .
the ribs were very good and lean . the tots and hush puppy 's crispy and had good flavor .
it was also pretty bland .
we did order some margaritas and again they were n't bad just your typical margarita .
they got 2/3 pizzas wrong and the third just did n't taste good . super disappointed
delivery is good but can sometimes take a minute due to the high demand .
great food and drinks .
coupled the dishes with a good bottle of merlot wine and it was heaven again .
so , that $ 30.00 has cost you a couple of hundred so far .
the margarita chicken is good , but the sides suck and seem old and stale . same with the burger , decent but the fries are usually bad .
this place left me feeling confused . it 's so beautiful and shiny , but so beautiful and shiny that it made me feel dirty and cheap .
we tried the steak quesadillas and the chicken nachos . the steak quesidillas were good .
carmon 's is a dingy little restaurant that has cute `` authentic '' touches here and there - fans that look like jet engines , mismatched salt and pepper sets , crappy paper menus shoved onto a clipboard , an antique cash register - but their menu lacks a certain something .
because our food was so long in coming i did not order a replacement entree which would likely not arrive until after our party had finished eating .
( too bad i got take out ) the lighting is quite dim .
great appetizers , and good pescetarian options , nice value . plus the deserts are super bomb .
on a 44 dollar meal that 's a pretty big screw up .
the food is terrible , 26 bucks down the drain for an order of chicken tenders , soda and a dip sandwich .
the red neon decor was so loud , i thought that i was color blind when i got away from the intense glow .
decent course , reasonable cost and the staff is nice .
since it 's impossible to have $ 13 mistaken for $ 21 , it was obvious that this was done intentionally .
the bathroom is dirty , dirty toilets , walls are nasty , no soap & the water barely trickles out if the faucet .
it came with a ranch sauce but did n't need it as the breading on it was enough flavor . it was perfect amount for me to much on , reminded me of fries : )
it 's not traditional , but very creative and quite tasty .
when our food finally arrived after a significant wait , especially for it being a non-peak time , it was lukewarm .
i went with a glass of malbec , which was a good choice .
everything is fried `` to order '' and boxed up piping hot which was excellent .
food is very reasonably priced and also pretty good quality .
the mixed drinks were nicely made , rather strong too !
given that this is an izakaya and the price is a steep premium , this is pretty disappointing .
first and foremost i got blackberry sangria , which was actually very good .
the worst customer service of all time .
welcome to the neighbourhood !
the decor was straight out of sex and the city and , needless to say , outdated and tacky .
it 's cheap and delicious .
you get great food for a very reasonable price .
great customer service , their staff is awesome and the food is ready quick !
i had the caesar salad , scallops , wellington , au gratin and brussels sprouts . everything was delicious .
i also thought it was expensive , $ 15.50 for a 10 '' two topping pizza .
not bad and they had a great selection of beers on tap and mixed drinks and wine .
when our uber driver dropped us off he said be careful after dark and under no circumstances walk alone this is the ghetto of the strip and and will be robbed .
the prices are extremely reasonable .
prices are super cheap too .
somewhat small menu but very good food . great margaritas , $ 9 on mondays .
the flavors and tenderness of the meat was incredible .
i 'm glad they opened this place up right by me .
such a fun , funky little wine bar . kind of a hippie feel , with groovy music .
the waiter asked us what we wanted for dessert numerous times , annoying us each time even though we politely explained that we needed some time to think and read it each time .
the only thing i do n't like as much is the décor ( except the hanging lights ) .
there is no food better than fresh grilled meat , crispy veggies , perfectly flavored rice , israeli salad and hot pita bread . i 'm impressed by how casual it is yet how delicious .
the whole decor was beautiful and the restaurants were good for vegas . the rooms were comfortable and clean .
all the martinis were half off and we liked the koi and dirty martinis .
perfect way to relax after a hard day .
now it 's just a tourist trap with fast food quality food at outrageous prices , even for the strip .
hardly any tequila in it .
it 's super disappointing that hotels with this much security can provide such poor customer service .
however , if i am going to pay $ 60 for a steak , a la carte , i might add , it had better be good .
got our food , it was cold . all the meat was salty .
we finally had to ask one of the nice bussers if we even had a server .
it was like eating a plate of spaghetti with one serving of marinara sauce lol .
normal prices , not overcharged .
it was also nice to be able to sit outside and be able to have a view of las vegas strip .
both pork and shrimp egg rolls were amazing !
we walked into a loud and dark atmosphere .
all this could be forgiven if not for the terrible service .
do n't expect a lavish layout lol .
the price is pretty high for a pizza .
wine was great pairing with the meal and toasting for the bride .
definitely hit this place when lemon is bartending , he 's great !
it had good flavour , was not overly salty and i was n't thirsty even after drinking a lot of the broth so that was good .
the decor was miserable and gaudy .
it turns out the bill is 38 dollars . most importantly , it tasted so bad ... .
the place is incredibly small , which adds to the intimate atmosphere , though for their own sake i wish they had more space .
it 's reasonably priced and comes out fast .
the food however , is just outrageously expensive for what you get .
typically this is a great spot to visit when you want to relax and enjoy the evening , the hookah is really great here and the drinks rock too !
the beef burro was plenty of beef but dry and nothing else no flavor at all , beans and rice were also dry , no amount of salsa could help .
it is almost impossible to spend under $ 10 for lunch there .
did i mention the prices are reasonable ?
the shrimp ceviche was cooked in a horrible lime sauce and just barely edible .
and we got all of that for only $ 20 per person .
finally when she decided to honor the customers with her time , she ignored me and went to the guy who came in after me .
i 'm giving it a 4 star because i felt like the decor was a little cheesey ... the food is amazing ... it deserves matching surroundings .
they have a lot of beers on tap but i got a weird look when i asked for a beer list .
the kicker , was that the people who ordered behind me got 2 free smoothies cards for having to wait , and all i got was `` sorry you had to wait for half an hour while your food was already ready , that should not have happened . ''
nice place ... family run .
5 ) club level heavy base `` serenade '' by white snake , guns and roses and unknown others over the sound system was just plain annoying and weird for a nice supper .
nothing else and i free soda all for $ 17 .
it was not a good value and cost almost $ 60 for two adults , one child for lunch .
my only objection was the price of this tiny pie , 12 '' pizza pie for $ 20 .
how does it get better . sure you can have a $ 60.00 foie gras burger , or you can order the same burger and add on foie gras for $ 20 which makes it only a $ 35 burger !
outrageous pricing for what u get to eat .
small criticism : the lighting was a little harsh , but as i did takeout ( and lighting is n't all together that important ) , this does n't really count as much of a negative in my mind .
the decoration and interior really suck unfortunately .
to be honest the decor is bizarre .
this was a surprising and delightful find ... and i 'm lucky that it 's so close to home .
i explained i was tired and wanted to get to my room that i paid for through expedia and if not within 20 minutes of arrival i was going to call them to get a refund .
customer service is n't important apparently !
our pastas looked beautiful , but had no taste . it was so bland .
beer and wine was unlimited , but they were serving only one type of beer .
kind but like all salesmen trying to get you to order tequila , drinks , ( at 11 am ) beer , margaritas , dessert ? anything ?
then , when i asked her what kind of ports she had , she responded that if i did n't know what i wanted , she was going to give me the most expensive drink she had .
also , make sure to get the discounted meal vouchers from the ticket shops on the strip ; you will pay half price for your meal and that 's a huge savings when you consider the normal prices of $ 50 and up for a meal !
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
they also have great drink specials .
they have a full wine menu !
good food for the price you 're paying .
but these surprise additions brought the total to over $ 135 per person .
the smell was amazing and the flavor did not disappoint . the noodles were perfect both in consistency & portion size .
( the outside patio with the waterfall was also nice but it was too cold to sit outside ) .
again , these items were finger-lickin ' delicious .
on top of that , it was the most expensive thing we ordered and was not filling at all .
it was tasty and pricing is reasonable .
they also have these giant cocktails that are like $ 30- $ 40 each .
only downside , they switched our beers at table , but all beer is good beer anyway .
however the waitresses seem to be cold .
it was bland . so was the gravy .
though the restaurant is very warm and inviting it was a beautiful night and we dined on the back terrace .
my fav breakfast place in town . they will draw cute hearts or flowers in your capuccino and the atmosphere is absolutely stunning !
it sure is n't cheap though !
prices are too pricey or high for the lack of service .
after 20 minutes , we tried ordering some drinks from the bartender who , in turn , was rude to us .
it was n't very busy when i went , around 4 tables total in the restaurant .
they have a take 2 special for $ 8.29 .
i also found some of the items to be bland .
drinks were also great , i had the blackberry mojito and my husband got the martinez . both were great !
dark , dingy and dirty were the words that came to mind .
also had the aperol spritz which was a beautiful drink with grapefruit and prosecco .
this is a cool place .
because of the extended hours and labor costs the sandwiches are easily 2 $ over priced .
not sure indian food should be $ 25 a plate . or sushi for $ 15 .
they helped us discover the perfect bottle of wine for us .
the food is amazingly delicious .
for $ 85 t-bone , that 's pathetic ,
the curry pan was toasty , crunchy but still light and fluffy .
packed , loud , lots of 20s and 30s dressed up if you 're into that kind of thing . my conversations consisted of nodding and smiling pretending i could hear what people were saying because its that loud .
i actually enjoyed the music there ( both variety and volume . )
all in all , a good place to eat good fish tacos and coconut shrimp .
kind of comes off tacky .
i 'm not one to complain , especially since it was n't the manager 's fault .
the waiter was very friendly when he was finally able to take our drink orders , but it probably took a good 20 minutes for drinks to arrive and our water took another 15. we ordered dinner then .
the cake had some kind of crust that was so hard i needed a sharp knife to cut it .
a true gem in summerlin .
everyone took care of everyone whether you were their customer or not which is always a great bonus !
the beer , wine and cocktail list looks amazing .
decent ayce , it 's nothing spectacular but it 's the price you pay for . drinks are not included in the ayce price .
the atmosphere is cozy and friendly with great music
the food presentation is unique and creative .
the pizza is wonderful , my personal fav is the bistro bacon salad .
excellent service and great half bottles of wine .
i mean , i guess the decor makes it upscale ?
our waiter was friendly , but inexperienced or untrained . he lacked knowledge about the food and kept referring to a notepad .
it took a good 10 minutes for my eyes to adjust to the cave-like lighting .
lunch prices were better than reasonable .
the one savior was the grilled cheese which was delicious .
the interior 's nothing fancy but it was n't uncomfortable and was fun to read some of the signs on the wall .
this , however , was inexcusably bland .
the price is cheap though .
the dutch crunch bread is really good .
i was disappointed they did n't offer any beer on draft .
the stuffed pretzels were great and the buffalo cauliflower very different and great for vegetarians .
draft beer selection was not extensive , but they offered tastings ( poured more than fairly ) and the beers they had were really good .
great prices as well .
the soup was full of seafood and was delicious !
my only concern for the room was that all the lighting were programmed in uniform so if you were to turn on the lights in the bathroom , the lights in the rest of the room would light up as well .
i love this place !
cocktails were also lovely and balanced , and for the amount we ate and drank , our bill was more than reasonable .
and $ 21 for chicken parmesan being 1 pounded out chicken breast and a cup of spaghetti way overpriced .
good customer service and their prices are fairly cheap .
the total came to $ 13 , not too shabby considering the portions .
the pizza buffet is very inexpensive and has a great variety .
we shared a bottle of malbec that was reasonably priced .
got very deep taste to it .
the drinks were n't `` weak '' !
i had wanted to try this place for some time . i had family in town and decided it was the perfect opportunity to check it out and i am so glad we did .
keep up the good work , guys .
unfortunately the service was quite slow , so be prepared to wait a while longer even after claiming your table .
the sweet potato fries were pretty good , but the calamari was burnt & inedible .
i was warned ... `` do n't get fooled by the pretty colors and sparkly lights ! ''
it 's very chill and comfortable .
it 's perfect for studying , reading and long conversation .
i only wish we had one here in in md .
lgo is such a great place to grab brekkie , lunch , dinner , or to hangout and get some work done !
the filet was subpar ; very salty , but edible . the sides were nothing exceptional .
the mayo seemed and tasted weird .
drinks are also superb .
lunch special is with reasonable price , and the service is good .
i was imagining a more romantic type of vibe but the bright pink paint was n't my thing .
the look was there , displayed nicely on the plates ; however , taste was lacking .
the rooms are a bit dated and good luck doing any makeup in that room because there 's zero lighting .
decent souvlaki for a great price . great place to fed the kids for cheap and it beats mcdonald 's ( which is n't that much cheaper ) .
the teriyaki sauce was watery and had a weird taste .
prices are extremely reasonable .
only reviewing the drinks here- expensive and the margarita tasted like there was n't any tequila in it .
i was quite confused as to why it happened .
the draft beer was totally flat . pretty awful .
and it 's decently good .
amazing service ! we had sara , who is hands-down one of the most attentive and friendly servers i 've ever had .
we got so tired of waiting for the check , that we just got up and went to the register to pay .
the baked goods ( brioche , croissant ) actually were excellent and the espresso was decent . lovely covered outdoor patio had heat lamps and a nice view of the pool area .
they were playing some old school jams definitely loved the ambience not too loud and not too bright inside .
food is decent price is right .
the rice was nothing special ; i would n't order it again .
and since this is a quick serve restaurant , she is your only contact and her attitude sets the tone for service .
i would say the price is moderate .
however , today , when i ordered a chopped cob salad , the bowl was extremely dirty .
it 's just awkward .
expensive and you get tiny portions , there is a sharing charge .
the green sauce is fantastic .
if you 're lucky , you 'll get a seat at the bar-like fixture and have a cooking show in front of you .
all food is excellent and price is great too . also the weekend breakfast is very good and includes your beverage for about $ 8.50 .
it was supposed to be sweet .
nevertheless clean and comfy place .
, there is a glass of wine with each plate of food that is excellently matched to the food .
i liked the comfy chairs around the bar , and there were tvs everywhere so it 'd be a great place for watching sports .
the experience is delightful and i would recommend this place for sure !
the wait staff remembered that i drank sweet tea !
they had a great wine menu with plenty by the glass to offer and their cocktails looked delicious as well .
the waitress forget about getting tortillas , does n't even know her own menu and idk she 's was just not paying attention at all , which i would understand if it was busy , but it was n't that night and there was just another table and a couple of ppl @ the bar .
the restaurant itself is . beautiful especially the bar .
late night special for $ 5 equates to $ 15 dollar a la carte from most restaraunts . a must for people who are out late after 12:00 am .
beers were not even close to full and wine poor was average .
late night for apps and drinks . great cocktail list .
i 'm only in the area on vacation so would probably try a different location for sushi next time .
if you like arnold palmers ( 1/2 and 1/2 ice tea and lemonade ) , they have a sun kissed ice tea which uses their tropical blend ice tea and lemonade -- easily my favorite part of the meal .
happy hour ! ladies the martinis here are to die for and are a great deal at happy hour .
once we got to our table , it felt like we were an afterthought to our server . she rarely checked on us and did n't seem to care about our experience .
prices were n't too bad especially for being on the strip . the total bill came out to around $ 40 .
good value for the money .
the tortillas were stale and the chicken was so bland .
i never know when that will show up , and it is still occasionally dirty upon sitting at a table .
the prices are slightly steep , not ridiculous , but it is enough that people comment about it .
want to make a water engineer angry ( my buddy ) ? do n't tell them you charge for tap water upfront , charge them after the fact and explain to them that you have the great filtration system ( q filtering ) .
the entire bathroom was filthy : no soap , no paper towels and the locks on the stalls are missing .
he never apologized for them or asked if we wanted something else . we requested them to go thinking he would comp us or at least only charge for 1. nope charged for both no discount and waited over 35 minutes for our food .
prices are pretty good . overall , a nice , little gem : )
the rice and cucumber salad were ok but nothing special .
pretty good for the price !
and they have some good beers for the pitcher not .
the room was impressive with sky light , living wall and `` waterfalls '' .
reasonably priced . good value .
everything was good but it was a touch expensive , clocking in at $ 65 for the two of us with tax + tip .
overall we thought the buns were about average ; not too outstanding in flavor nor was it terrible . personally i thought the bun itself was good , but they skimped out on the filling , especially for the ham and egg bun .
some find that really cool , i find it gimmicky .
the location is loud for sure its a country bar so understand that up front .
for me it looked like they were n't trying to hard to serve the four people that were there and in no wa could be equipped to handle a rush if any ever came .
prices are good , place is clean enough .
the chicken salad was full of fatty chicken pieces that should have been trimmed and thrown away .
great deal for cheap .
it is only $ 27 per person for all you can eat .
the decor is nothing fancy , but i 'm a huge comic book fan and i admired the numerous comic book figurines in the bar area .
the prices are reasonable .
taste wise , the ice cream was nothing special , it was like regular matcha ice cream you could buy from the supermarket .
i took a look at the beer list and was pretty impressed , as they had at least fifteen different beers on tap , plus i think that they had a bottled beer list as well .
the sauce is the perfect mix of sweet and tangy .
had a great dinner at 300 e. on a wednesday evening ( half-price wine by the bottle ) and found the entire experience outstanding .
food was amazing and reasonably priced , too .
if one is paying 22 bucks for sliders they better have some crack in it or something to justify that price or make it so flavorful that you feel justified paying that kinda money .
as for alcohol it 's bottled beer and a few selections of wine only here .
staff made us all feel very special .
viewed through that lens it 's a nice meal for less than 10 dollars .
also , it 's semi reasonably priced !
he also had extensive knowledge of the sake list and made great recommendations .
delicious food at very reasonable prices .
the prices are really decent .
place : no ambience , no personality almost depressing .
service was exemplary and the food outstanding . i had the filet and my husband the rack of lamb .
my only gripe - paying 20 $ for wi-fi , but that is pretty much the standard with all resorts .
our waitress was excellent and above and beyond as far as being attentive goes .
you pay wynn prices but all you end up with is mediocre food in small serving sizes . it 's more of a gimmick then anything .
we will continue to come back ! service was amazing and everyone is super friendly !
5 ) club level heavy base `` serenade '' by white snake , guns and roses and unknown others over the sound system was just plain annoying and weird for a nice supper .
sushi pizza ( salmon ) : it 's hard to go wrong with a fried rice patty dipped in soy and wasabi , but the topping was subpar .
head on over to salty to check out happy hour , just stick with the chips and salsa , a cold beer and maybe a quesadilla .
service : sorry to say but kind of slow i had to ask for water three times , and we were n't approached for almost ten mins .
the reuben rolls were delicious and the potato wedges were perfect for the third period .
lunch is $ 10 and the portions are decent .
i was drinking the magical lemonade , pretty sure it was lemonade and vodka but it was damn tasty .
the burrito would have been more enjoyable if there were n't any of the hard dried up rice inside of it . the beans were ok. were n't watery and runny like other places can be .
it 's a real coconut and it is simply delicious .
i think that the quality of the food justified the prices .
our hostess was polite and very attentive to our needs .
i hate it 's clean designer lite decor .
like the dark knight ; ) you know what i mean !
only pluses is that it was cheap ( ~ $ 150 for 3 nights over holidays ) , rooms were big , and close to encore and wynn .
i love bright ( some would say tacky , but whatever ) walls and glitter .
i love this place .
than all they can tell me was sorry you need to have a printed coupon .
for all of this , the price was a reasonable $ 9.99 !
black beans undercooked and hard . rice bland with a hint of orange color for `` spanish rice '' and best part you 're out $ 12 for a disgusting burrito .
of our creations the pimento mac and cheese with bacon , grilled onions and fry sauce was the favorite . we enjoyed the everything cream cheese on our second dog that also included bacon , siracha sauce , grilled onions and hot fries for a little crunch .
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
the food is good but the service is poor .
my husband and i both enjoyed the fillet mignon .
pretty much every time i go richard is working and he always makes my day by how nice and friendly he is ! not to mention he makes the best smoothies : )
overpriced , overhyped , but decent . expected stronger drinks for the price .
if you 're craving fresh authentic fish tacos the coastal trio was absolutely delicious !
they also have a good strawberry lemonade drink i would recommend .
i am sad that it is always packed because ahwatukee is a wasteland of nothing but chains , so this place is dubbed hip and different , and thus continues to be packed every weekend with soccer moms and their families .
- lamb & duck prosciutto dumplings i 'd recommend everything that i ordered : ) although the lamb & duck prosciutto dumplings were n't as special as the others .
i did n't see one decent beer on tap or in the coolers .
prices can get a bit steep but you certainly get what you pay for .
first of all , there was no host or no server at the front , which was quite awkward , there was already a party waiting in front of us.. also , we waited more than 25 minutes to get our margaritas .
reasonable prices for the quality of food .
great lunch deal for a reasonable price !
we each ordered a flight and had a bit of each of the summer brews ( except ginger cat ) - they were refreshing and light tasting .
i ordered a combination fried rice only to find out that the rice was only halfway cooked through . i was n't expecting much by stopping here , but i 'd appreciate it if they at least showed some effort towards food .
fish was dried out .
however , be prepared to spend a pretty penny on ice cream ( usually over 6 dollars ) .
i walked in and the place is a cute small little spot , but very clean and i like the look plus they have a couple of outside tables .
the pork belly looked and tasted like it was boiled and the overall flavor was pretty bland .
then i think she might have mumbled something but i did n't hear her , she finally made eye contact with me though so i went ahead and told her what i wanted .
love grabbing a big , cold glass of crisp cider ( strongbow on tap ) with any kind of hot , crusty pasty i 'm in the mood for : traditional hearty , zesty indian , spicy mexican , healthy !
i was served luke warm , dried out , hard eggplant `` disks '' that were covered with sauce .
live music is overwhelmingly loud when you 're sitting inside , but super cool to listen to nonetheless .
this manager from the start was very rude eating his food before getting my order .
at around $ 9 , it 's quite expensive for a burrito .
beef was well done and flavoured , perfectly moist .
the only not great thing was the margarita which seemed over-priced with a poor pour of tequila .
excellent meal . great sushi and wagyu seared steak was incredible .
a little disappointed . after spending over $ 25 for two calzones and salad .
off their az style menu , the black pepper chicken and twice cooked pork are simply amazing .
the only beer they had was budweiser .
price is super reasonable .
this place is great !
the atmosphere was great , except for the constant flickering of the track lighting ( it was quite distracting ) .
the location was clean and well kept .
this time i had the steamed mussels for an appetizer and they were delicious .
with her recommendation i tried one of their specialty drinks , the captains hurricane which was delicious and my friend decided on a strawberry mango yinzerita , which also was a great choice !
just make sure not to get burnt chicken , it ruins the taste .
very fresh fish , good ceviche .
- decor : the restaurant decor is so nice .
the layout and vibe of the place is great . the beer selection is one of the best i 've come across .
the atmosphere is trendy and fresh .
staff is always very sweet . i recommend this place to everyone .
they are friendly , quick and my order is always right .
( and baby change table in the rest room ) not a lot of ambiance as it was too loud and busy .
also , cheapest place in the city to go for drinks , for non alcoholic try their thai iced tea . delicious !
this is my wife 's favorite place to eat . good service and deliver as we 'll keep ordering even my kids love it .
not too sure why others are saying differently about the food .
the service was good ; neither overwhelming nor did i have to deal with a server abandoning me until check time .
the bar itself is nice but not worth the money bathrooms ... atrocious ... they stink ( pee and mildew ) , walls are falling apart , out of order ( photos attached ) ...
it was obviously just a communication issue and could 've been remedied easily .
it is so good . after you finish your wings , the slaw has soaked up flavors from the wings and it is out of this world amazing !
the prices are very reasonable , even on beer .
prices are too expensive .
it does n't taste that good with the food .
this is officially my new favorite sushi place they have the freshest fish available , i tried the salmon special and jesse 's special roll .
unfortunately there was a good 2 '' on either side of the burger + toppings of plain bun , rendering the open-faced concept quite questionable .
the worst parts , short black hair was found by two of us , in one of the childrens food .
just did not taste good .
i 'm willing to bet our margaritas had no tequila in them .
a nice , cool spot to go to .
i think she was 12. margaritas were hot and tasted like there was no tequila in it .
the brussel sprouts w scallions that came with the fried chicken were out of this world !
unfortunately , the flavor was n't there .
when we complained about the service again , the waiter was extremely unapologetic , and very adamantly said that although service was `` slower than usual '' , it is entirely normal for the dishes to take over 40 minutes from the point it was ordered to be delivered to your table .
the dough is perfect and chewy .
the beef brisket was decent , but it was served at damn near room temperature , and a tad on the dry side .
this is my favorite restaurant in vegas !
the drink selection is also great .
food was fresh and delicious ! the owner stopped by and was very friendly and personable .
great place to just hang out with friends for a relaxing night .
our room was dirty and dingy - the wall paint was chipped all over , there was a hole in the ceiling and the carpet between the bathroom and bedroom was frayed and coming up .
the food was good , but i would call this a $ $ restaurant . not that great of a value .
the beer selection is good , but pricey . the cheapest pints are $ 6.75 .
it 's very rubbery and bland and makes me feel like a dog chewing on a tire in a trailer park . their `` gourmet '' hot dog has a microwaved taste to it and is very dry .
the dishes are pretty delicious for such a cheap price - around 7 $ for each plate !
do n't come here expecting an intimate gathering .
food was way over priced , yeah i get it 's vegas , but still hurts to pay a $ 50 for only eating half of your food and drinking an over priced beer .
i highly recommend this place if you are visiting las vegas .
they were flavored well and had nice crispy edges . definitely recommend .
great day service by nice people .
the drinks were refreshing .
love buffet here . have some really good options including butter chicken , tikka masala and chai tea .
she said the food is good , but she doesnt understand why it 's so expensive .
the service is unbelievably good and the fish tacos are simply delicious . the pastry and ice cream selection are always fresh and top notch .
we pointed out the problem and the server was not surprised . she just took the bill and redid it the right way .
service is okay , food quality is below average and prices run a bit higher then is justified .
lights too bright , turn them down somewhat .
i felt totally distracted for some reason by the decor and ambiance .
i liked the atmosphere , the coziness and the warmth ( literally ) coming from the centrally located kitchen .
great prices as well .
always a pleasant experience on my frequent visits .
the beer is cold and i have mixed drinks about feelings .
finally tried this place after passing by many times .
no draft beer - but they have a good bottle selection .
it 's located right in front of the ka theater , so it 's convenient if you 're watching the show and you have the munchies .
i ate the chicken and waffles sandwich with the tots -- amazing !
i live in los angeles where we have no shortage of persian cuisine , but i have yet to find a restaurant this good .
prices are cheap too and the sizes of the drinks go with the price .
good value for price .
no decor except four walls painted flat black and lined with televisions on them.. using the tv 's for lighting i think is so you do n't see what the fake food is ... the beer was cold .
beer and margaritas available , not sure about any other alcohol .
husband had the tofu teriyaki bowl and he did n't think it was anything great , tofu was a little dried out .
even one of the draft beers was bad !
service wise , was lacking . found the servers to be pretty rude , cold , and unwelcoming .
let 's not even discuss the thin walls or `` blackout '' curtains .
very nice and expensive atmosphere , friendly and knowledgeable waiting staff .
what was especially impressive for me were the wine pairings .
price tag exceeded what i would normally pay for thai in a bar , but i am going to blame the $ $ $ on the location and the brand name of this restaurant and the reputation it carries .
the people who work there are pretty clearly uninterested in serving you and they do n't hide it .
on the upside they had an amazingly large tap selection along with a massive bottle offering .
the service was really fast and easy-going .
all in all , definitely a great place to come to for cheat day for sure .
when our food came out my food was cold , my wife 's chicken fried steak was under cooked the batter around it was still raw .
there are no more than 13 dishes in a sunday grand buffet for the price of $ 13 they are charging .
the price is reasonable and food rates good .
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
this place is great !
cost me $ 31.00 for a nothing special lunch .
when we tried to order drinks , the were out of the only draft beer , negro modelo ... and 3-4 of the bottle beers , and my 1st tequila choice ... then the bartender actually told me the hefeweizen bottle beer was `` just '' like the 2x ipa they were out of ... .really ?
as always great experience .
we thought this would be a good place to celebrate my brothers birthday since we have been to other locations and had good experiences .
the lobby looks good but get any further and you start to see the nasty ceiling tiles , cracked and stained drywall , broken faucets , moldy grout and broken furniture .
i do not hold that against chase 's however , it is extremely difficult to find good biscuits around here , and their effort is no worse than many . fortunately there are plenty of good things to make up for it .
- yes , the bathroom looks like something out of the scariest of scary movies .
the restaurant was empty the entire hour that we were there .
our server was super sweet and attentive .
there was nothing remarkable about this dish .
but i expect a bit more , in taste , not proportions , from a restaurant that charges $ 20 for a simple chicken item .
my trash can had a woman 's makeup debris ; i found a hair on the edge of the bed . the room itself just looks `` rough '' , chipped furniture , dirty cracks , oh and the patched wall in the entry !
i was quiet uncomfortable because the experience was true to what a blind person feels .
the congee however , is either way too salty or way too bland depending on when you go .
the jonas shrine in the bathroom hallway was a little creepy and confusing but apparently the owners are maybe kin ?
i had the blt salad for a starter and the big apple pizza for the entree , both tasted delicious !
i recommend the hummus plate . it was the perfect amount of food and the flavors blended perfectly together .
regardless , go there for late breakfast through lunch and you 'll be happy .
bartender was very attentive .
one kind of beer .
i 've had the beer here before and it 's great , so i opted for the frozen sangria with red wine , and that was delicious , fruity and very refreshing .
fair pricing , good food .
each dish was served hot , the plates were well sized , and a great value for the money .
we would have just ordered from papa johns or pizza hut if we knew we were going to wait for 20 minutes for something that normally takes 5-10 minutes which the cashier stated it would only take 5-10 minutes .
good selection of wine , i had their fillet mignon , several bottles of wine , and a nice sorbet desert .
the burgers come with a side of rosemary fries which are very delicious .
always excellent service and friendly folks even when the place is packed .
i honestly do n't know why i expected more from this place , i loved the interior design and lighting but the food did not satisfy me at all .
such a great place !
located in lawrenceville this brewery and restaurant has amazing food and beer while enjoying the beautiful church .
the prices are super cheap , and the meals are okay .
very good food with friendly 70s kinda atmosphere .
they did n't and the service was extremely rude , almost hostile .
the unlimited beer/wine was nice , but there was only one craft beer on tap , which was disappointing .
the food is pretty darn good and the show is good too . prices are pretty good .
the atmosphere was nice , although it did get pretty loud once the restaurant was full .
we sat by a window and had a great view of the strip .
prices are reasonable too .
only downside , they switched our beers at table , but all beer is good beer anyway .
sound just bounces off the hard walls and makes it very difficult to have a conversation .
the decor was dark but did n't feel creepy .
highly recommend the happy hour , they have amazing drinks !
the prices are cheap and you get nice sized portions .
the prices are cheap for vegas .
i ordered the chicken fajitas , and they were n't bad but it was nothing to rave about .
an outstanding meal for right around $ 10 .
it was a refreshing drink that went down a bit too easily without being cloyingly sweet .
most of the dishes were pretty ok but if you 're only paying 15 bucks , it 's good enough .
the cafe was quiet for most of the morning , which was great for studying and doing some work .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
my personal favorites include the chocolate mousse for dessert which must absolutely be tried and the calamari appetizer on the lunch menu .
sushi pizza that came with it was dry and tasted bland .
only gripes are the little details in the room were overlooked ... loose faucet handles , disgusting bath mat , moldy looking grout between bath tiles ... these really kept me from giving it 4 or 5 stars .
food is authentic , cooked to perfection .
the interior 's nothing fancy but it was n't uncomfortable and was fun to read some of the signs on the wall .
the high prices did not correlate to high quality food .
that typically i would have expected her to get the manager and try and rectify the situation because when all was said and done i did receive the wrong food it was not what i ordered .
oh and hats off to the sushi chef tonight for the new and delicious white tuna with the mint and the ponzu sauce , delicious !
$ 55 for two with tip , so very expensive for what you get .
the bathroom was actually scary and dark .
there were the normal beer options ( no craft ) and the wine was barefoot so nothing to write home about .
the decor looks like it is from a trendy burger joint . very industrial .
the lighting makes it very unappetizing . the `` waiters ? ''
the decor is rustic and a little old school , which i think is pretty cool . the atmosphere is cool and casual .
no . were they good ? no .
this place screams tacky in ways i never thought possible , and to make it even better , mirrored walls and ceilings amplify your ... experience .
it 's pretty much dim inside , talk about blind date .
i ordered the turkey burger and it was tough and dry .
service was attentive , friendly and not rushed .
salad was really great antipasto .
the restaurant itself has very new york style feel on the inside , the outside of the building hides the fact that it is a casual fancy place .
i also had the ramos gin fizz drink - it has a good flavour but a bit too creamy for me .
the prices are very reasonable .
the drinks are decently priced .
awesome little hole-in-the-wall place . the atmosphere is relaxed .
rooms : tired looking , stale decor , old school style , no ipod docks , big fat fax machine , difficult to locate lighting , difficult to locate power outlets , no wifi , mediocre bathroom amenities .
however the cost of the food compared to what you get is ridiculous . you can get salmon at any other place for a lot cheaper .
even though it is pretty difficult to screw up rice , it was n't served hot .
the server mentioned that on tuesdays they had a great happy hour ; half off of tapas .
love the food and wine selections . great malbec wine !
and they serve a nice variety of wines by the glass .
the chicken and potatoes were flavorless and bland .
they said it would be `` first come first served , '' which is ridiculous for a group this size on a friday night .
great food and drinks .
it was decorated in a really cheesy asian theme , replete with a creepy floating baby head that gave me the willies because its eyes were following me .
the decor was tacky to begin with and now its just looking tired and dusty .
the first time waited well over the estimated time by 45 minute , and when the guy finally came , not even an apology .
the restaurant is a restaurant bar that only seats 18. the line is along a walkway of slot machines .
they were out of corona so i had a beer on tap sorry do not remember name but it was good .
but only thing i did n't like was the lighting , it seemed kinda dark .
we stood there for over 10 minutes as several people walked by and said `` we 'll be right with you '' . there were two other couples standing there as well when finally someone came up and said oh i 'm sorry we 're closing & in an hour & ca n't seat you now .
the panninis are reasonably priced and are quite large .
i mean $ 3 bottles and $ 5 drinks .
it was ok beer was not that great tasting you ca n't even buy a small glass of beer without buying a flight .
random but the bathroom was clean .
the drinks were delicious and they did not skimp on the alcohol .
i also got a cadillac margarita that tasted like they just lazily put the alcohol and margarita mix .
my son and i both had the beef and broccoli and the beef was so tough you could not even chew it .
the room service is good quality and considering it 's a 5 star resort relatively reasonably price .
bad idea ! margaritas were ok but not booze in them !
it might just be the placement of the furniture , but there 's something that kind of feels ... awkward .
a great deal for the price , especially at lunch .
birthday brunch on the patio - pineapple mimosa ( they also offer oj or cranberry versions during weekend brunch ) & a painkiller ( rum , coconut , pineapple & oj ) were a great start .
they were packed full of flavorful , roasted vegetables and came with a side of rice and beans as well .
dry , breaded and deep fried did no favor to poor quality cod .
both were delicious and satisfying . the side of miso peas was addictive .
the food is decent and the prices are fair .
with some subtle lighting this place would be great but i felt like i was in a parking lot - you could not turn towards the one light without getting a painful beam of light in your eyes .
but a restaurant should not run out of popular items first thing in the morning mere minutes before a busy lunch hour .
they have an amazing selection of sushi and everything i have tried has been outstanding .
it 's not too expensive and you get more than what you pay for !
really great food here , reasonably priced .
i love love love this place .
i was very pleased with the 1/2 off glasses of wine special , and my bartender , jenny gave superb service !
i usually get a beer and as much as i enjoy a cold mug of beer i do wish i could get a cold pint glass of beer .
the only reason to come is to drink beer out of the schooner glasses but alas they only have crap beer on tap .
we decided to go to archie 's we always hear such good things about them and have n't been here in over two years .
and needless to say there should be a sense of urgency to move through your line .
i asked again if it was possible to have the sticky area directly in front of me wiped down and the bartender just kind of ignored me .
i highly recommend you try it !
this restaurant is massive and quite beautiful .
try this place & you 'll be a return customer for sure .
it 's ok , sides were n't good at all and the meat was n't very warm . it was pretty salty for me but some people like that .
give them a try , you wo n't be disappointed .
tried one of the omelettes which was delicious but the best thing here was their coffee .
what i did n't like about the theater was that the popcorn tasted stale and old , not hot , and the lady handed it to me in a bag that was all crumpled up at the bottom .
i did n't think it was possible to serve a bland soy sauce but somehow the sauce they serve with the potstickers was bland as hell .
friendly dealers and great atmosphere , not to mention it feels like you 're sitting gambling in paris !
it 's just sad when there 's a host/hostess stand and no one is there to welcome you .
the drinks were great !
comfortable environment that will draw you in to experience the best of your senses .
as a small business owner , i thought it would be good customer service to return my call with a simple pleasantry , thank you , or even possibly an apology for the mistake .
fantastic view of the strip .
protip : try the alcohol , it 's delicious !
i had a tall beer on draft , and some nachos which were actually pretty good .
i did no drink one , but apparently the margaritas were pretty good and not a bad deal by the pitcher .
the service is also noticeably pleasant , helpful and accommodating . just a great place for a relaxed dinner any night of the week .
did n't get a drink but looked like a nice selection of beers on tap .
the interior was a little dingy ... .it was poorly lit but did not have a `` fancy restaurant '' vibe ... it just felt ... uncomfortable to be eating chinese food .
we saw here walking about and at points just standing talking to her friends , which normally is not an issue but we were hungry and after 40 min we gave up trying to get her attention .
i love this place !
the interior is nostalgic , sure , but really just cluttered and painful to look at .
i would go everyday if i worked closer .
the beers were ok , nothing special .
they were drenched in oil and were not even close to bring appetizing .
the lighting is just absolutely horrific .
i checked this place out last week and i was highly impressed .
it 's down this weird concrete hallway that make you feel like you might get jumped or raped in there .
it was like someone took some chicken and the cheapest hot sauce they could find and put it into a food processor .
great food at reasonable prices in a city where everything is quite over priced .
the iced tea made with rose water is delicious .
the decor was a little dated and outright weird to say the least .
we also had their wings which was pretty good and juicy .
everything that you touch there , after walking on the carpet , gives you a nice , static electrical shock .
the cocktails we ordered were on the strong side . i was buzzed fairly quickly .
we ordered bottled beers -- their beer selection is good , i will give them that .
they had a nice crisp texture and the ranch was nice touch .
the room itself is showing its age , the tablecloths on the tables were ugly , lighting was incorrect and staff was seen dragging tray jacks and pushing around a rack of glasses on wheels to place dirty dishes on .
i have been there 3x so far .
i highly recommend the one with mushroom , garlic , arugula and goat cheese .
it was ok but nothing special for $ 20.00 . probably would not go again .
the prices are fair .
good salads , service was very friendly . the also have free carbonated water on tap which is nice : )
service is decent and prices are great .
i only found one small piece of fat which was n't off putting to me ( because it was melt in my mouth ) .
wine recommended with 2 different tastings was a great experience .
the grounds are gorgeous . the paths are beautifully landscaped with lots of private romantic nooks .
i just wish the place was more acoustically kind to not have conversations etc bouncing off the walls and ceiling .
anyways , great place .
there were so many road signs and posters on the wall , i 'm really not sure what color the walls were .
love the vibe of this place and a really great happy hour - 3 of us girls shared 5 $ 5 appetizers and drank $ 5 glasses of wine and we 're happy campers .
we started with the blackberry bourbon lemonade , which was definitely a heavy pour from the bar , always a good thing .
the lighting was totally off - it was way too bright .
we were warmly greeted during a rare arizona rain storm and the beautiful lobby space was a nice way to pass the time .
we sat there with drinks only for well over 40 minutes & not one person noticed we did n't get food .
customer service at this place is so bad .
their hummus with veggies is a very good portion for 3.99 as well .
beer - the beer selection was nothing special and they do n't serve it in a cold glass .
did n't get a drink but looked like a nice selection of beers on tap .
it 's well balanced . especially liked the broccoli pesto .
first time and what a pleasant surprise ! food and service was outstanding !
the black beans had some good flavours but were skimpy and nothing special .
great place to take your family !
the wrap was good , not great , but totally worth $ 5.99 . the salad was huge , delicious , and also a bargain at $ 5.99 .
not exactly exotic but certainly delicious and tasty .
the drink selection was so lame .
wow ! such a fun place to watch a movie at .
but as far as the price goes , i do n't believe it was to reasonable , we paid $ 37 for 2 adults , the buffet is $ 14.99 for dinner plus the drinks are an additional $ 2.50 each , most buffets in the valley include a drink & are even a little cheaper than they are .
i 've only been here once , i was recommended by my cousin to order the blush peach signature iced tea since i love anything rose !
overpriced ! i 'm willing to pay $ 25 for a sushi roll but it had better be good .
plus , the staff was very rude about it .
great food and drinks .
it was ok but nothing special .
it creates this intimate atmosphere where you would not want your noise level to go higher than a whisper .
the bathroom was disgusting and out of paper towels . the floors were dirty and it looked like the toilet had been leaking making the floor wet .
is the fighting over dramatic and corny ?
just an all around bad experience .
but taste was so so , inside was cold .
$ 40 for breakfast for 3 is pretty high , but we keep coming back .
the pancakes are delicious and the bacon is thick and flavorful .
this place has great stinky tofu , unfortunately everything else is just ok. also they suck at communicating , instead of one type of noodle ordered , they brought us two .
waiter started off nice but got rude near the end .
drinks and cocktails are on point with a varied and innovative cocktail list to please anyone .
i ordered the salmon burger with a salad , and although the food was n't as bad as i was expecting , it definitely was n't what i would call restaurant quality .
nice intimate setting & good for those w/ kids .
the thin slices of tuna were tender and fresh .
absolutely nothing special . food is mediocre and definitely not worth the expensive price tag .
such a great place !
prices are very reasonable for what you get .
they had a very small selection of it and they did n't taste that great either . however i did like their thai food there and it was pretty good !
and the total came out to around $ 75 for 2 people for a mediocre lunch .
so 2 was perfect . cocktails and beer were great too .
the food is decently priced ( for the strip ) with a meal costing around $ 20 per person ( not including alcohol ) .
the ambiance is superb ... the indoor/outdoor seating gives great options depending on the heat !
the tacos are only two dollars each , but they could be charging much more for the quality that they are .
solid place and nice ambiance and decor .
total price for the meal was over $ 14 .
the manager or the owner refused to come to talk to us and had the stupid servers come talk to us . obviously he or she had no guts to come talk to us .
it is right on the corner of the fashion show mall .
the only thing i do n't like as much is the décor ( except the hanging lights ) .
i substituted the drink for one of their twisted alcoholic drinks .
the decor was very simple yet effective in giving that `` wow '' factor .
2. the lighting in the bathroom is terrible .
first impression , really dark and sexy ( for lack of a better word ) .
while after another 30 minutes or so our food came out as cold as could be . we attempted to eat instead of asking for another super long wait for another meal .
i gave this one a three stars mostly because we ordered a pitcher or margarita and honestly i did not taste any tequila .
and as cocktail nerds we really enjoyed our hendricks g & ts ( served with cucumber ! ) and a deliciously on-point negroni .
i describe it as filipino food with a touch of exotic style .
but , i suppose the manager made up for it with how sincere he was when informed about what happened and giving us free dessert , which was delicious .
they serve organic which is why the prices are on the high side .
the décor is classy .
i was n't sure what role any of them played and the whole thing just seemed annoying and disorganized .
the sushi is of good quality and the price for the food is very reasonable . the lunch and dinner specials are really good value for the money .
the seaweed rice really has an overpowering taste of seaweed ( pretty good in my opinion ) but if you have an aversion to it i would avoid it .
beer - the beer selection was nothing special and they do n't serve it in a cold glass .
the interior 's nothing fancy but it was n't uncomfortable and was fun to read some of the signs on the wall .
cool urban decor filled with `` beautiful '' people dining inside , on the patio and working behind the counter !
pretty reasonably priced and the food was good .
this place was not particularly cheap either because you are looking to pay at least $ 20+ per person if you intend on doing their kbbq .
i was not disappointed with the food .
i bet they bought cheap noodle or boiled it for very long time .
the ambiance is nice , it is a unique trendy place
the decor is sleek , cheery , and innovative .
it is super tiny but i did n't have to wait long for a table of two .
the thin crust pizzas are amazing . i also love the pasta .
also , the women 's restroom was dirty and there were paper towels all over the floor .
we were so confused as to what the issue was .
restaurant is small but with a very intimate and quaint feel .
my order was ready withing 20 minutes , and the food was great .
firefly also has a pretty decent drink menu including a sparkling sangria cocktail that i ordered .
prices are very reasonable .
i loved this place ! we partied here on a friday night , and it was amazing .
i just wish the place was more acoustically kind to not have conversations etc bouncing off the walls and ceiling .
the salad is hefty and could easily be two meals .
the service was friendly and attentive , they have a great wine selection ( their house wine was a nice spanish wine ) and the pizza was good .
prices are cheap too .
our waitress was very knowledgeable about menu and all of the wines was able to make perfect suggestions so we allowed her to select all menu options . looking forward to visiting byblos again !
and way overpriced for the quality you get , which is pretty average .
service was so shitty today . party of two , i guess since i 'm heavy all the food kept coming to me when i kept waiting for my order , the server forgot to put the order in or all my hot orders came out cold .
love the decor of the place .
it 's a big space , and clean , but with that vague hint that maybe all of the patterns and colors are hiding uncomfortable amounts of dirty .
we were then forgotten about again and as my family was tired we went up to the host stand ourself to pay our bill .
there is a dock where people can hang out and swim and the view is pretty nice .
the prices are very reasonable for the food .
in their defense , the bottled beer was good .
our waitress was not great at refilling drinks and even forgot when asked .
as promised the service was slow , only somewhat friendly .
kind of like feet .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
my drink , iced tea , was the only thing that i really enjoyed .
for $ 5.50 maybe i 'm insane for buying it but i expected it to be good .
rooms were clean but possibly appeared that way because of the dim lighting .
i 'm not sure but does home made pasta really taste doughy ?
i got the greek salad one and it stated great . the eggplant was good and the kiddo liked the falafel .
cherry cider was fantastic . bartender dropped 2 drinks , but was a good sport about it .
make the kids wince under the horrible fluorescent lighting as they try to read the menu and massage their throbbing temples .
they have a special deal on the menu for a 20 '' with 5 toppings for a little under $ 20 .
3 - reasonable price .
nice staff , nice dining room .
i 'm 100 % ok with spending $ 85 on a great dinner , but the food was neither good enough nor filling enough to justify that price .
the prices are good too .
decent tacos , okay price , friendly .
the loft is a favorite because we can sit on the sofas , put our feet up on the ottomans and relax .
the decor was atrocious ( i would rather not have to look at a statue of a naked man while i am eating ) and the walls were covered in pictures of half-naked people and pin-up girls .
the only thing positive is the decor .
was lucky and did not have to wait to get a table .
service was very friendly ... however everything else was lacking . food was extremely disappointing , felt like i was eating boiled baby or old people food .
i ordered a mushroom pasta , and for being a mushroom lover , it was the only thing i could taste .
the drink selection was so lame .
check it out . you wo n't be disappointed .
i loved that they ( of course ) had a vegan menu and options but they also had great drinks like cucumber infused refreshing drinks and raspberry limeade . so delish !
excellent food , excellent service and the best happy hour -- glass of wine for $ 4 !
we were not difficult customers ( asks for little and do n't cause trouble ) and were just trying to have a nice meal just like everyone else , it makes me feel upset that we were treated poorly and differently than others .
but the ingredients appear to be great quality , so part of the reasoning for higher prices seems justified ( partly ) .
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
the value is good .
the music is incredibly loud at this place that you can not hear people talking at all .
i had a glass of pinot noir and a great chat with the bartender .
while we did not drink any booze , they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers , wine , and specialty cocktails .
prices are reasonable and there is a pretty good selection .
additionally everything of reasonably priced .
it was also reasonably priced , which is always a added bonus .
we met friends here for a `` beer & banter '' dinner ( 1 dinner of a 3 series of 5 course set menu meals paired with different breweries ) .
this has always been a family favorite for a good time .
we had a good time with the free wine .
my glass of wine was great .
i had a blueberry martini that was dreamy and for dinner i had the halibut entree which was also very good . their wine selection is very good ... i did have a glass of wine too because someone ordered a bottle of wine and i felt compelled to help him out : ) and from what i remember the service was also very good .
you 'd like a margarita ? you 'd like a happy hour margarita ?
the service was great and food was perfect temp and portion . i recommend the hummus .
the service eric provided at the bar was impeccable .
the prices are really good , especially considering the quality of the food .
the lighting was nice , i could see my food but was n't blinded by lights .
only downer : no outside seating .
the bbq here is awesome , lots of choices , everything done just right .
the pizza was awesome and the appetizer was also very good ! great place to have a drink and a slice of pizza .
the drink menu is vast !
if they truly wanted to earn my business back they would n't have chosen an offer that was as weak as possible .
they are cheap and friendly which is good for me .
strange i asked for ice as i wanted a chilled moscato that the original server told me was sweet & chilled . not sweet or chilled & the ice came once i was done with my wine !
the ambience is n't that great but why not get take out instead ?
weird sauce flavor . dislike .
i got a combo platter with brisket , pork and chicken .
the sauce is so sweet it 's almost like dessert .
at $ 14 it was expensive , but i liked the flavors .
i strongly recommend a vodka tasting flight ( best of the motherland is outstanding ) .
kind of silly ) and the flavored tea , whether mango or blackberry is yummy .
the portions are huge . chicken is fresh and juicy !
some ice cream is made in house which is impressive , the best i 've had is pistachio .
the atmosphere is very lively and energetic without being too loud , our whole table was able to have a conversation without feeling like we had to talk over music or too much noise .
i think the prices are reasonable for some delicious food .
the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute .
only thing i could complain about is it is a little higher priced .
also good here are the fish tacos ( they 're huge and delicioso ) ; tortas are bomb too .
the food is fantastic ! i highly recommend the pasta carbonara and shrimp napoli .
location is super fun , and the atmosphere of the place is very cool and modern .
the garlic prawns are so good and i always order them .
we ordered for pickup , even coming earlier than they said , but our food was still a bit cold .
prices are not cheap especially for the food .
the outdoor seating has a great view of the strip and all the people strolling by .
i 'm not an expert on interior design or anything like that , but it just did n't feel comfortable in there .
the only good thing about this place was the sangria which was a bit too pink for sangria but lots of alcohol in it !
long story short , we waited almost an hour only to finally realize that the hostess crossed out our names by accident so that we were never going to be called .
the seasoning and spices on the steak were n't all that special either .
terrible service . order wrong .
definitely a relaxed atmosphere plenty of motorcycle parking right up front .
very dry and not crispy .
sadly no - low quality , flavorless , dull and absolutely nothing special at all .
we also order the steak , and some rose ( with the help of the waiter ) to pair .
after tax it came to a little over $ 19 which is amazing .
also spicy but delicious as well .
if it was just this , i would probably not review them so badly but my first impression of this place was not great and does not improve after .
good selection of beer , wine ... not at all .
beer selection was weak as well , and their bottle menu was inaccurate .
we ordered a lucky peach mojito but instead of tasting like peach it was heavily ginger focused because of the ginger beer ( bit of a misleading name ) .
great food and comfortable , family-friendly ambiance !
the frrrozen hot chocolate drink had a more appealing and fun presentation served in a glass cup , which made the experience more enjoyable for me .
i do n't like having sloped walls or windows because it makes me feel claustrophobic .
i would highly recommend this place and will go again .
the drinks are strong and tasty .
i have some friends who live in vegas , so i always meet up with them sunday night after a wild vegas weekend and grab dinner before catching the first flight out mon morning .
great value for the price .
their sangria were good and refreshing !
no hot water or paper towels , dirty , and down a sketchy hallway .
beers are cheap for a restaurant .
however , you can te that the ingredients are fresh and good quality ( lots of butter ) .
i love gin so i 'm not to familiar with vodka so i asked the waiter to recommend a vodka that goes good with tonic .
i 've been to sunday brunch at mon village many times and it 's always been a great experience . we 've frequently booked a room for the extended family between 10 - 15 people of all ages and everyone leaves happy .
they had a good selection of beers and something i 'd never seen before , jameson on tap . i 'm very curious as to how liquor on tap works ( and why a mexican restaurant had whiskey on tap instead of tequila ) but we did n't have the time to stay and investigate .
we had my birthday dinner here and it was really good !
the prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality of food .
the fries were very thick and crispy and there was just enough gravy so that they did n't get too soggy without sacrificing the taste .
food was good . nothing fancy , but it is lower priced and you get what you pay for .
i felt that the place was a shithole disguised with nice decor .
they have a good wine list , so we ordered a napa cab .
our waitress was fantastic and so friendly .
i think this place has to be visited on your trip to vegas but i might be incredibly biased by the chili aspect .
the decor is pleasant but the darkness in the restaurant ( 7:30pm ) , reading the menu requires night vision goggles and makes the decor nearly invisible to appreciate .
it 's just kind of looks a little rundown and dirty .
the food was good , reasonably priced .
it was delicious and refreshing , too bad they charged me for a drink with alcohol $ 13.00 . i tasted my friends drink which was a virgin of the same kind .
pretty empty restaurant and waiting to be served or at least given a menu . hard to get the waiters attention for any additional requests or to get your table cleaned for dessert .
-prices are a tad high for food , but their craft beer prices are great .
they are reasonable as well on their prices .
it was awful . i ate maybe five bites and was done with it .
they had a good selection of bottled beers but nothing on tap .
sadly it was ice cold , and quite unenjoyable .
the cod was fresh and fried to perfection , the half portion of mahi mahi fries was pretty big , delicious although a little spicy .
the house made sangria was good .
happy hour food , drinks and prices were awesome !
i highly suggest this place .
aesthetic and atmosphere was super chill and inviting .
i did n't like paying $ 40 for mediocre stuff .
the beer glasses were n't even frothy , and the beers on tap that arrived were n't even cold .
this place is awesome .
i have been shopping at this giant eagle for a few weeks now .
all flavors are pretty basic , and bland but they serve their purpose .
i know it 's going for an authentic old-time appeal - but it 's dark , dirty and kinda icky feeling .
the summer rolls and potstickers were delicious . i had a salad tiger cry and my son a noodles entree with beef .
i asked if they changed there menu lately and she said no .
walking in , i felt a little intimidated by the overwhelming presence of stuff on the walls and trophies everywhere .
they had a good selection of beers and something i 'd never seen before , jameson on tap . i 'm very curious as to how liquor on tap works ( and why a mexican restaurant had whiskey on tap instead of tequila ) but we did n't have the time to stay and investigate .
draft beer selection was not extensive , but they offered tastings ( poured more than fairly ) and the beers they had were really good .
there was a hot dog shop and ample outdoor cozy seating which i enjoyed for a bit while people watching .
very nice ambiance too .
my wife had the chicken dish and it was dry and rubbery .
mmmm -miso sea bass satay ... so tender , buttery , delicious .
the sides were good as well .
great cocktails , but no draft beer . need i say more ?
i even once tried a pretty awesome jalapeno margarita but honestly i would rather drink the beer .
even though yelp says the price range is reasonable i thought it was expensive considering the quantity i received .
the owner went beyond and took responsibility for the mistake and tried to get us the missing platter but unfortunately there were no postmates drivers showing in our area at this point , being that it was 2am .
happy new year to the fantastic family running this place as they obviously take pride in their food and their service !
hallway leading to washrooms have some quirky notes , read them for laugh .
it 's pretty small , but cozy .
it is super filling and at a great price ( $ 19 ) .
my latest visit was on a weekend .
the food was good and fair priced .
i love poutines but it 's just not the food item you spend 13 $ on .
ordered a beer in the bottle as they only had the typical `` crap '' in my opinion on draft .
the bus person was very sorry .
over all i had a great experience here , the is price alright , it came to around 12 $ dollars per person .
while my own experience at feeney 's is in the past , one has to be impressed with a restauranteur who cares .
love their blizzards ! a little tricky to find but just drive around the mall till you see it !
it does n't have a cozy cabin feel .
food is delicious ! such great flavoring to the dishes .
just a bizarre design .
i 've had the chickpea burger , and shepherd 's pie and both were fantastic !
good service , and decent prices
they have a pretty good beer list , though nothing on draft .
this place needs a good manager . very long wait times , it 's dirty , and customers service is terrible .
and did i mention that the margarita was very weak ? i think the bartender forgot the tequila .
maybe if i came from a country with no clean water i would think any of this food had flavor but yuck it was all boring and dry the meats i had to chew like rubber . the seafood was like drinking the texas gulf .
after such a bad experience you would think they would also cover the one glass of wine and pint of beer but nope !
rude staff , horrible pizza w/ almost no toppings , refusal to correct wrong order , over priced .
the popovers are delicious and the jalapeno mashed potatoes are currently an addiction that i have yet to kick .
i did n't find anything special in here . my spicy miso ramen was good , but one of my friend asked for hot soup , and turned out to be a lukewarm soup in a super-hot bowl ... ... my friends were complaining on how bad their water tastes .
not muddled properly , and it tasted like gin not rum ... .let 's try the nachos ... .hmmm canned guac , canned jalapeño , and add chicken that is cold and cut up from the night before . at least the spotted beer glasses are cold ... .
i would highly recommend the soups , baklava , chicken lettuce wraps , and veggie platter !
so happy my roommate introduced me to this hidden gem .
i tried the lychee calpis soda drink and thought that was pretty good too .
beef salad is the worst .
we called back and they said it would be ready `` soon '' which finally gave us an update on grub hub saying it was finally on it 's way after an hour after placing the order .
reasonable prices , good food .
its too bad because as recent as a year ago we liked our visit , but things are going south here .
especially when there are so many other places to spend your hard earned $ $ $ so close by .
lamb kebob , shrimp kebob , and lamb kefta and none of them were really good .
glutton is cozier ; we really enjoyed the atmosphere .
good for a quick , cheap meal .
so your 8 dollar burger turns into a 13 dollar combo once you buy everything separately , so it is a little expensive for a burger joint .
the place is loud with some good music playing .
the food is a bit pricey and usually indian food is on the lower price point but this prices were justified in my opinion .
i was really happy to find such a wonderful restaurant nearby .
the only downside is revamping the cocktail and wine list .
his favorites are sweet heat and siracha ranch . my go to is honey bbq .
they only had sapporo on tap . there is a pretty nice selection of bottled beers but they 're terribly overpriced for a bottle .
each time i was there we were the only ones there and if there was to be others there im not sure how the only employee would have been able to handle it ... .
good food , and reasonably priced .
the appetizers were really good , only the quinoa balls stuffed with mozzarella left it quite bland if there was n't enough sauce on it .
we were looking for bbq and found this place on yelp . food was great .
the prices are super reasonable .
the decor and ambience is pretty charming , lots of brick and german beer signs .
it is a good deal , as it is around 6 bucks after tax .
in general , we found everything to be overly salty , to the point where it pretty much ruined the taste of everything .
they also have an great wine list including a very affordable house wine .
tequila selection was pretty good but the bartenders were clearly hired for other credentials than tequila knowledge , if you catch my drift .
the food tasted good .
it 's a very trendy place & if you do not mind a dj playing music in the background you should have a great time .
the lighting is pathetic .
great food , great atmosphere , good music !
the dinner menu is roughly 2-3 dollars more expensive than the lunch menu , which i thought was great .
i ordered a drink that was not on their menu , a vodka collins very light on the simple syrup .
the drinks are moderately priced , just like the food .
drink 2 glasses and you will be feeling great !
it 's not awful , but it 's not worth the high prices either .
also it 's outdoors so when the weather is extremely cold you will feel the chill and when its blazing hot in the summer you wo n't want to be outside .
their mustard sauce is perfect with it .
the service is always friendly and fast .
the cheesesteak gyro was huge and the `` meat '' was really tasty . and nice people too .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
it was fast , tasty , and reasonably priced .
first off food was undercooked the homefries were pretty much raw on the inside , bacon was awfully chewy .
my only complaint was that the soup was a little too oily .
keep up the good work brian !
and the treehouse looks like a great spot for the little ones .
the food is really good . price is fair .
poor service aside , i enjoyed my glass of shiraz and my sister enjoyed her dessert martini , which was made perfectly -- not too strong and not too sweet .
they have a great selection of wine .
the wine and dinner pairings on friday are really great too !
even if there is a mistake they fix it right away .
it 's cheap , tasty , and quick . the lunch specials are simple and good too .
she said that the owner decided to no longer honor groupon ? she explained that some people would only spend $ 22 and instructed me to call groupon for a refund .
it is also reasonably priced .
the ambience was nice , the seating pretty comfortable , too .
also the bathroom was kind of messy with paper towels strewn all over the floors .
i asked the bartender what kind of tequila it was , they had no clue !
their saving grace was the nice waitress who noticed me waiting forever and offered me a drink .
flavors of india serves up a decent lunch buffet .
the lunch special is delicious and reasonably priced .
the meal was fairly priced and a good value .
we were full by this point but i asked anyway `` what do you have for dessert ? ''
good bar to drink at ... but maybe not eat at
beer was cold but all the mixed drinks had almost no alcohol .
the bathroom set up is kind of awkward .
the wine list is also great .
; ) ( the cocktails by the way were wonderful , and worth the money )
no beer on tap , though , which is disappointing .
the choice of indoor or outdoor seating was nice , but if you ca n't do heat , know that it 's all open air , so there is no a/c to save you if it is too warm out for you .
the prices are reasonable and the food is pretty great .
i then ordered the enchiladas which were dry and flavorless , we also ordered the chicken fajitas there were 5 tiny pieces of meat .
not too spendy , good food at an honest price .
they have a tasting menu for $ 100 per person , but you only get 3-4 courses , which is not that great of a deal ; i 've eaten at restaurants in the bay area that are michelin starred for just about that , but with more food .
no but it 's a $ 12 a plate place - lighten up : ) beers are cold , food is hot , people are nice , price is cheap .
the chicken salad was ok. i think the best thing was the drinks in which the waiter suggested a lychee martini .
it is easy to miss this rooftop restaurant off of indian school but it is worth a stop if you are looking for great views and upscale bar food .
in the east coast , we only find fusion here so this was a pleasant surprise for us .
pita kitchen is surprising delicious .
the only thing is it was a little in the pricey end as it came out to $ 80 for two but you 're at the aria what did you expect ?
chicken meatballs , ny strip tataki , corn , kimchi , pork dumplings , etc .
beer and wine yes , hard booze no .
i do n't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible .
the draft and bottle beer selection is legit , but mostly focused on regional selections which was disappointing .
i 'm just not a fan of loud dance music at a wine bar .
yummy . the uptown girl is also a refreshing cocktail .
cool and hip and a low-key kinda place .
not bad and they had a great selection of beers on tap and mixed drinks and wine .
the drink selection was beyond impressive as well .
the restaurant also had good ambience and decor .
ordering feels a little awkward at first , due to its cafeteria-like style .
we had lamb , beef , turkey wrapped in bacon , and chicken .
my sister does n't even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style .
seriously ? i also asked the waitress if there was added oil in the beans to which she replied to , `` no '' .
ca n't go wrong for less than $ 20 for a filling brunch : )
i think the breakfast stuff seemed to turn out better than the lunch items with the exception of the fried potatoes which were still kind of hard .
for dessert i got the cheesecake , it was good but it appeared store bought .
pour a good cocktail .
does n't need to be fancy just the worn out booths were very uncomfortable .
however $ is on the high end considering the portion .
great food & drinks .
it was pretty clear they were friends of the owners or staff or something ( a waiter from a different section came over and sat with them for a few minutes ) ; but if i 've been waiting over 45 minutes for food and they saunter in and get put to priority , i 'm not overly impressed .
the mac and cheese was bland ( even with the addition of broccoli ) .
my friend and i went on a thursday so we took advantage of happy hour and the half off bottles of wine !
and only $ 10 !
the ladies bathroom was very cold and smelled funny . the men 's room urinal was broken and the toilets were dirty .
the remodel has brought in horrible disrespectful employees ... and the food sucks now .
server always remembers my order they 're very friendly .
the wine selection was abundant and had some decent selections . the food was great , especially the seafood .
the prices are a little high , but the food is great .
fresh fish is expensive !
beers , cocktails , happy hour and a killer staff .
i caved and got one of the specialty drinks because it did not appear that a glass of wine was part of the happy hour special .
great place for a date night or a girl 's night out !
the bbq ribs have been our favorite chinese ribs and they crispy chips and duck sauce have been a favorite as well .
prices are reasonable as well .
the food was reasonably priced and very good .
we were both so pleased with our food and service and will definitely make this our go to steak spot !
great place for a quick bite with reasonable prices .
the queso fundido was swimming in oil and somehow managed to be bland even though there was chorizo in it and it was made out of ... melted cheese .
food was bland , i 've had better food for cheaper .
i also got the beta which was a nice and light drink .
all of that at a really cheap price !
beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor . or at least the menu was .
51st floor view of las vegas was breathtaking view , the venue was not that packed on a tuesday night so it made it easy for us to move around the venue which was perfect .
good food and good value as well . go on tuesday for $ 5 sandwiches and discounted beer .
lighting was slightly dim , but i kind of like that vibe .
taken altogether the atmosphere was great , food is average , and cost for the complete package excessive - unless you are on someone 's expense account .
i had alaskan halibut which was cooked to perfection , and a gin and tonic that had a wonderfully healthy serving of gin . a great way to start a night .
sauce was nice and it included zucchini but i found the calamari a bit tough .
they are very rude and put up an attitude if you correct their mistakes , which they make frequently !
creepy bathroom all the way up the tiny staircase .
the margarita was weak but ok and there is no way to screw up a cold corona !
they also have really cool cocktails that were both light and refreshing .
the burgers were delicious and perfectly cooked the sides appetizing .
food was fantastic and so was the view .
i did not like having to wait over a half hour in line , only to have a really unpleasant rich couple be allowed to skip ahead of us just as we got to the front .
what a joke . only a moron would pay that for a mediocre bar in the middle of the city , and then pay $ 6 for a beer .
and the prices are pretty decent
loved the digital art screens and the large table was perfect for getting some work done .
drinks were a little weak but draft beers worked well enough .
slightly expensive for me .
not a ton of seating , and not a lot of outlets but a really nice pretty quiet space to study if on the go .
it 's also of note we , a party of four , were seated in a walkway seat enjoying the scenic view of the staff as they entered and exited the kitchen .
awesome customer service . i love this place and will be back soon .
i was disappointed they did n't offer any beer on draft .
i love this place , food is more then you can eat and very delish ! my first time eating here is in san diego , hands down this place is awesome !
if you are willing to go for a ~ $ 120 meal , it is great food .
olde york has a simple recipe , with good , flaky fish , a crispy batter , and most importantly , that is not too greasy .
take it from a real foodie , this place is terrible . if you have any food standards , you wo n't spend your money here .
was skipped in line after waiting an hour . was lied to saying my name was called twice.. almost walked out , glad i did n't the food was exceptional .
they have only a few beers on tap , a pretty good choice of bottled beer and a basic bar stock .
it is certainly not gourmet pizza but you do n't pay $ 20 for the pizza either .
the portion sizes were great for what you pay , like my gyro platter had an even amount of meat to salad to rice .
very clean and great service !
every time i 'm home in toronto , i make a point of stopping by to have their dragon b and chicken age .
wine was good . champagne was delicious .
the food was delicious as well , you have to try the fried calamari !
both were very good and the portion sizes were huge .
also my purple haze martini was superb ... i only needed one which is shocking for me . i 'm usually a two drink girl .
i got the brisket sandwich , which was great while my company enjoyed their plates as well ( hanger steak and scallops ) .
they had an excellent drink list and beer list in particular . service was attentive .
it 's pretty big on the inside and they also have a nice patio for outdoor seating w/the high tables and the lower tables .
it is far better and contains actual pieces of chicken .
i do n't know why , but the entrance feels weird , like its cluttered or just too confined .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
i got a kombucha cocktail which was awesome , i 've never had a kombucha cocktail before .
the service was very slow and the server did n't know the difference between a draft and bottled beer .
this little swanky underground club is so cute !
good italian food , nice atmosphere and very friendly owners and staff .
we finally got her over to our side and she wanted to charge us for our drinks- even though she had missed the green light on our machine because she had been busy chatting up other clients .
a little expensive but ok for the quality of food .
prices are very reasonable .
i do n't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible .
nice music , a quiet area , they also have a fireplace and outdoor seating .
other than a quick `` sorry '' we got nothing !
the prices are a little high , however my rule in life is you get what you pay for .
they have only a few beers on tap , a pretty good choice of bottled beer and a basic bar stock .
you get a fair amount of food for what you pay .
server was very attentive and service was quick .
the baked beans are a perfect complement to this , as well as the cheesy baked mac and cheese .
loved everything about the dishes .
i love the music since it creates a very cool atmosphere .
the selection was very poor as far as bottled beers and what was on tap .
when i say drinks i mean sodas - no special bar drink or something .
been coming here since day one , which was about 10 years ago . wow has it grown !
the price was awesome , $ 8 dollars for 6 type of beers .
i called to see if i could come in and pick it up and the girl who answered rudely told me that she 's positive that she gave it to the driver .
first impressions were nice decor and cool open kitchen area .
they also have an exceptional wine list ( by the glass ) .
for a $ 55 dinner i could have gone to a nice steakhouse and gotten a much better meal for the same price
great place for quick and cheap meal .
there was hardly any cheese .
decor does n't really make sense with fancy chandeliers and bright green chairs but that 's not the worst thing about this place .
instead of providing 2 meager pieces of fruits , a salad would be better .
the cocktails are good , those bartenders know their drinks !
beer selection good but server had no clue .
kinda price , but fair to the location
the food was alright , but there was very little chicken in our order and mostly bones and cartilage .
my husband and i had dinner and dessert here on valentines day ... the salad was interesting as well as tasty and my ahi was very good served on a bed of greens with a nice avocado sauce and other veggies .
i cant believe that he has never heard of this place . sometimes this is the only reason to make the drive from los angeles to vegas .
almost everything is under $ 10 and portions are pretty generous .
the price of the buffet has jumped up to $ 49 per person which is n't too bad however the menu items do n't justify the price we can all buy eggs sausage pancakes and waffles .
very good , consistent , reasonably priced food .
one final note , the light switch for the bathroom is on the outside wall , behind a gray electrical box , just follow the black arrow .
annoying . on this same note , the decor inside is really simple ( no problem there ) , but it also borders on uncomfortable .
fried rice was ordered without certain ingredients but it came with all .
amazing food , great service and wine list .
everything on the menu is great and reasonably priced .
the price for rooms during the off season are really reasonable and they have a beautiful pool with a water slide that overlooks the pristine golf course .
we also ordered the house margarita and specialty blood orange drink : strong on flavor and alcohol !
annoying . on this same note , the decor inside is really simple ( no problem there ) , but it also borders on uncomfortable .
$ 25 for a 3 course meal , it was pretty good !
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
the women 's bathroom was clean , just had a weird layout .
any time a server delivers your margarita with , `` i 'm a terrible bartender because i like drinking too much .
food , excellent , service beyond excellent , ambiance wonderful . we had kyle , very helpful and professional with a sweet smile .
i would love to have given them five stars , but our waitress was more interested in seating new clients than dropping our check .
all cocktails were made perfectly . steaks were cooked properly and sides ( risotto and sautéed spinach ) were delicious .
had nachos which were surprisingly meh . bar tap choice was kind of limited , and they did n't have all on tap .
weird they charge for fried rice but still got it .
no draft beer there but a nice cold bottle of corona .
the ambiance is really nice and comfortable .
i enjoyed this special girls night out made with firefly spiked tea and it was delicious .
was getting tired of paying $ 12 - $ 15 for a plate of thai food for lunch and leaving hungry .
it is a great amount of delicious food but it is priced a little high .
drink prices a little high though $ 23.00 seemed ... . well
highly recommend this place .
it was awesome how the cashier would talk to each customer as if he 's known them for a while .
i got a chicken quesadilla and a glass of the house chardonnay .
tried the pizza and they all looked dried out .
another note is the tiny awkward bathroom .
most dishes had little or no flavor . i was very disappointed .
it 's a seat yourself , cozy place .
awesome deli with a full breakfast menu and great salads .
has a big picture window with a nice outdoor view . good choice .
love this place ! i 've been here 2x 's now and had great food each time .
i had the super nachos and they were excellent . we also got an order of fries with jalapeño cream cheese , also very good .
i 'd highly recommend it for a date night or birthday celebration .
the slaw jazzed up the tacos ( since they were doubled corn tortillas with bland fish in the middle -- that 's it ) , but it was bitter and bland as well .
i liked the atmosphere of the restaurant too .
it was happy hour so we had the house margaritas .
drinks are yummy and served in the funnest glasses . great decor .
everyone was content with their food , but the poor service made the experience one i do n't care to repeat any time soon .
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
it was pretty distracting ... who does n't like cartoons !
if you do n't stop you will miss an great experience .
very friendly . good service .
note to management - please do n't confuse overwhelming noise with ambiance or being cool - it 's not .
really good food at a reasonable price !
i was not disappointed .
the pizza was no good though . the crust was undercooked and the sauce and cheese were both really bland .
everything is very reasonably priced as well .
they also have a nice selection of beverages in addition to the everyday fountain drinks and iced tea .
no tap beer , no blended drinks for a decent margaritas and out of steak for tacos .
my lunch was a lobster roll steel city style . my wife enjoyed crabcakes salad .
as for alcohol it 's bottled beer and a few selections of wine only here .
it was n't the cost that i had a problem with ; $ 35 for 2 is reasonable .
the prices are very reasonable .
their wine and craft beer selection is just right along with having cocktails that fit the happy hour vibe .
my only criticism was that the katsu was so thin that it seemed a bit too dry . the sauce was good though .
the only beer they had was budweiser .
they 're wine pour is generous and wine list is different .
i truly am not trying to be mean but this waitress is bad for business at least by my standards .
they have unlimited fries for $ 2 with meals so make sure you say unlimited and not small or large because those are $ 2/ $ 3 .
loved all the side dishes to try , pancake is amazing and i adore the kimchi .
great place , reasonable prices , considering it 's vegas and everything is expensive .
$ 5 for a big serving of food ! cash only .
the chicken they use for their food is delicious .
the food had good taste . the bad : the service was very sub-par .
if you 're a tequila fanatic they are extremely knowledgeable , and sold us multiple amazing margaritas .
staff is so amazing and friendly .
four words : happy hour and tapas ! everyday , from 4-6pm , customers can enjoy half-price tapas ( appetizers ) and $ 2 of beer and wine ( by the glass ) .
the kids that work here are always super nice .
only thing is that it 's a bit pricey paid 36 dollars for 2 hot dogs and 2 fries it was worth it !
together with the dingy furniture and shabby decor , i was seriously worried about food poisoning . the service was pretty bad too .
the bad news : the lighting was horrible , so bright you did n't even notice there were candles on the table .
the owners are very talkative , and come off as some of the most genuinely kind individuals i 've ever seen run a restaurant .
good size at an affordable price .
the soup was just good , not great but still good , i 'd say the same about the gyoza .
very reasonably priced and you can have a pint with your food .
the service tonight was not very good -the waiter pretty much ignored us .
i read a lot of great reviews about this place on yelp , so was excited to try it out .
we always sit up at the bar to have some appetizers and their incredible mango mojitos !
with a loud no , no toilets .
yes its kind of scary ; but omg .
the beer was good , but the margarita came with no more than an inch of the glass rim salted ( `` is n't that bartending 101 ?
very popular trendy restaurant . ambiance is very sexy and dark and seating is sectioned off so you can have a more intimate group experience .
the layout and scenery is beautiful . the staff is poorly trained the menu is boring and limited .
the food is good , but nothing to be bouncing off the walls about .
ordered the special medium any way , buy 2 for $ 6.99 each .
beer - the beer selection was nothing special and they do n't serve it in a cold glass .
the cocktails were not great but they had a full bar .
tried 3 different style meats and were tasty .
honestly it was almost a bit bland though , so maybe i should have tried the first spice .
the decor of this restaurant is so authentic its bright and colorful .
great little deli . very friendly staff take good care of customers and the food is fantastic
corned beef and hash was great , as well , with thick slices of beef and plenty of potatoes .
i live right next to this place so it 's convenient for me to stop by and get a drink when i 'm craving boba . i 'm so happy that there is a spot close to me and a quality place as well !
again , very disappointing .
the place is quite affordable , especially for a restaurant located in the venetian , the dishes usually average to a price of 13 to 15 dollars .
plus , the pricing was great !
the food is pretty good but the prices are too high .
it was also during happy hour so i got a margarita .
enjoyed a glass of wine and a beer with the sandwiches .
not cheap but not expensive .
the atmosphere was great , and we enjoyed the variety of music ( and accompanying music videos ) being played .
i love that they play music from the parking lot , it definitely adds a special touch !
my server was super nice .
the actual place is a little divey , although charming with its authentic thai sculptures and knick knacks .
the tab was typical las vegas strip expensive which is another reason it 's only ok in my book .
i was expecting a puréed soup ; also found it was a little luke warm .
the decor is kind of strange i do n't know why .
the decor is beautiful , patio looked great and lots of whiskey but beyond the appearance they fell flat .
decor is funky and it was a good date night place .
it was only about $ 11 !
the view is amazing .
hardly any salad inside them .
i only wished there was a little more rice or another starch , as there was so much sauce and it would have made the stew even better .
after such a bad experience you would think they would also cover the one glass of wine and pint of beer but nope !
yes , they were very pleasant but when you are spending almost $ 100 for dinner , you 'd expect a different calibre of service .
dinner price with a drink puts you right around $ 20 per person anyway .
the whole burrito was only $ 7.99 , so it seemed ridiculous to pay $ 6.50 for the sides .
the ugly : the food .
the place is a little bit in need of an update ; the decor is not bad or worn out , but the patterned carpet just makes it feel dated .
the other annoying thing was the bright fluorescent lighting from the kitchen that shines directly in the eyes of half the patrons .
i was told they have a good selection of beers on tap .
breakdown : decor : nicely done , made me feel comfortable , `` warehouse chique '' i guess you could call it .
there lunches are on average $ 7-9 . not bad considering the amount of food you get .
prices are pretty cheap here .
lots of menu choices ; hard to choose ... i recommend it highly .
the dessert was the worst display ever -- very little offering , disgusting stale looking desserts , and ice cream suck big time .
the food was amazing -- i 'm an avid salsa eater , and can be a bit picky , but it had the perfect bite ! i highly recommend the margarita infused with cucumber -- i had my reservations , but it was so refreshing , and offset the bitterness of the tequila perfectly .
prices are also very reasonable , which is nice .
and the prices are reasonable considering everything cost more in vegas !
eclectic , cozy , bohemian vibe , reminiscent of a small village gathering spot on the mediterranean . artsy , beautiful hand finished wood tables , great selection of coffee and tea .
the small specialty pizzas are 14 inches ( ! ) and only $ 10 which is an awesome deal .
steamers , ossobuco , the steak , the desserts , even the seafood is all amazing .
maybe it was because that chicken wowed my buds or maybe i did n't like the queso sauce on the burrito .
i went with the smoked salmon blt and was delighted .
for the price you pay this is horrible .
hidden gem ! great bbq spot that could fit in just as easily downtown .
a bowl of mediocre pasta for $ 15 ? definitely not worth it .
the salad with dressing is simple , light and so flavorful .
so far i 've tried the sangria and the house strawberry margaritas .
great vibe and decor although the lighting was so dim it caused eye strain and dried out my contacts .
the non alcoholic malt beverage was surprisingly delicious . the dishes all stand alone very well .
the fish is terrible quality and dangerous .
this is a nice , cheap , yummy mexican restaurant without any flashy side . it 's good food for a good price .
i was with a big group and nicole , our waitress , was superb . she was very pleasant and helpful .
almost forgot about my terrible coronarita ... cheap margarita mix in a normal drinking glass with a corona sticking out .
server was nice , ordered the citrus mint iced tea ... .wish i had n't .
memorial day breakfast , homemade everything bagel and egg bagel all the way with lox , cream cheese , red onion & capers . bagels were perfectly toasted , nicely constructed sandwich , fresh and delicious as always .
the steak was a bit bland that i needed steak sauce ( which i normally do n't use if the steak is flavorful ) .
the prices are reasonable about 7 dollars a slice without a drink , i believe it was an additional 2 dollars to add a drink .
only wished heineken was on tap , does have bottle tho .
hands down , currently my favorite boba place in las vegas !
they serve the kind of fries that have some kind of crispy coating on them that give the fries sort of a light breaded texture , not just cut potatoes .
sadly , the roll was an utter disappointment .
it 's the most expensive entree i have ever paid for .
they all were really delicious but the cold noodles really stood out for me .
they have a drink bible and an incredible wine list .
i really liked the vibe and atmosphere of the place , it is an upscale gastropub and definitely feels special .
food is fresh and authentic .
you will not be disappointed
certainly did n't justify the price .
been coming here weekly for the taco tuesday special around a year and still going strong !
everything about our visit to jojo 's was delightful .
there calzones are delicious . there pizza rocks and lots of specials every day !
the sandwich filled the whole plate and was delicious !
for $ 60 this should have been really good .
i love the cucumber martini . i love the bartenders .
food : the menu is diverse and well prepared dishes with great wine and drinks pairing .
good service , and relatively cheap prices .
used get the prime rib sandwich all the time but it 's just not as good as it was . very bland , the bread 's not the same either .
it was just mediocre and expensive for the quality .
i can not stress how terrible the service was .
the fish tacos were ok. i played $ 20 , max play in the machine and they only comped 1 beer . for $ 20 in ?
i had hummus and street tacos , both very good . we also shared a cornbread and it was ok. service was adequate .
i picked the fake meat off and was left with tomatoes and avocados , still good but not substantial .
my only concern though is the lighting .
but only for beer .
a good place for $ 30 but not $ 55
reservations are recommended , the patio outside is nice and relaxing .
only thing is that the bathroom there is kind of ghetto .
they were dried out and burnt . the fries and the so called burger were ice cold .
this plaza has a lot of different restaurants to choose from and boy do i regret coming here .
the service was outstanding . everyone on staff was pleasant and helpful .
great tasty food and atmosphere ! the owner has a high standard in keeping the restaurant clean and providing good service .
good food . cheap .
puke under tables , women 's bathroom horrible , smell , glasses in sink ... .
really clean and cute inside .
the service was top notch , everything we ordered was fantastic , great advice from the nerdy wine chick on a bottle in the $ 100 range .
their shaved ice is so bland that it does n't warrant the $ 7 price tag .
crust was burnt , the cheese was burnt , the entire thing was dry and , well , burnt .
this place is dimly lit , but not to the extreme where you can not read the menu without your server pulling out a pen light .
again portion here was great and the texture was amazing .
our service at the bar was fantastic and the margaritas were delicious : )
it was fresh and delicious as well .
not sure why people rave about the margaritas , i think they either have no tequila , or it 's severly watered down .
the place in general attempts to be a little classy , but they have childish menu signs , place mats , and dated picture frames .
the vegan guacamole and `` chicken '' fajitas were amazing ! the prices are very affordable .
it was about $ 50 for 2 for dinner . i only ate probably $ 15 at most , i failed at gluttony but made up for it with booze .
both times i have had the sashimi dinner ( delicious ) and the japango roll , which i highly recommend .
huh ? bartenders were ok ... though real slow getting me another beer .
i am disappointed as this is a gem downtown but i will talk a break from here due to the food quality .
bunners your not the only game in town , i will never spend my money there ever again .
amelie 's is an absolute must every time i go to charlotte now .
beer was nice big but no cold glass .
signed a once happy customer but so upset with the professionalism and how customers do n't matter
the crust is perfect for a pan crust pizza , fluffy , soft ... .
the babaganoush was `` omg go good '' .
very loud and cramped , was n't feeling the place at all .
what 's the deal with only 10 per serving .
i do n't think they even own a microwave or a freezer , because everything tastes really fresh and flavorful .
they have very nice wings , and a very cheap pool table . nice patio to sit .
the ice cold orange flavored beer was very refreshing : - ) our waiter , john , was simply amazing .
happy hour is worth checking out - discount drinks and appetizers that could easily make a meal .
where in town can you get a good meal for 2 people and the cost was $ 20.00 .
though.. i waited 30 minutes for my food.. not sure if i went on a bad day but was disappointing .
love the rustic , off the beaten path vibe .
drink prices reasonable too !
was drinking bottle beer so hard to not get that right .
my sides were horrendous as they were bland and cold as well .
i asked for a hefeweizen but no ; they have 30 beers on tap including 6 different ipas , but not a hefeweizen in the house .
good ambience and decent prices .
and their drinks are expensive so they would have made probably more money off drinks than the overly expensive food .
i would highly recommend the stuffed cabbage and the potato pancakes .
planning a nice night out , we decided to try rao 's and we were very pleased with our decision .
the beer selection is pretty good and the drinks are pretty cheap for toronto .
as an alternative , the radler from the cocktail menu is quite good with strong fruity notes mixed with a light weissbier .
always a great experience . the staff is friendly and hard working .
now , consider the fact that a matta 's meal will cost about $ 10 , for really bad food , in a take-out restaurant .
i had brown rice , and the flavor stood out noticeably against hunan chicken .
this is a nice touch and is always welcome in my book . worth a visit !
had a great two hours of fabulous food , wine parings and service .
i appreciated getting to sample the beer before i ordered a nice large mug .
he also recommended a very reasonable bottle of wine that was fantastic .
had the butter chicken pie and it was heavenly .
they had a decent draft selection and everyone said the margaritas were pretty good .
the drinks were good , i loved the blackberry sangria , my parent 's margaritas were top notch .
i gave it two stars because the crust was chewy and bland . the toppings on the pizza were bland as well .
food was good and reasonably priced .
prices are fair - a budget of $ 15 per person is plenty enough .
the place is pretty big and in a bustling area of mgm .
i think is not worth the try because it is dry and burnt with bland flavor .
it 's a bit far and of course , expensive but you get more than you expect for your money .
it was all pretty okay , but nothing remarkable .
but hey , you 'll only spend $ 20 including tips for a one course meal .
very clean and charming inside .
the food was delectable as usual and i especially enjoyed the refreshing iced green tea that they offer ( my bladder was working overtime to keep up with the multiple refills ) .
great food , charming , friendly , fast
i got the prime rib eggs benny , which was just ok. the beef was a bit too chewy for my liking and did n't really have much flavor . the home fries it came with were also pretty bland and the hollandaise was way too mustardy for me .
price range around 8-12 not too bad .
the lodge has a nice enough atmosphere with alot of seating , a non-smoking area for eating and pool tables .
the food was bland and mediocre at best . service was just okay .
i have never had such bad service .
it took about 30 minutes for our food to come out and the place was completely empty . but , when the food eventually came out , it was delicious !
i only tried the cheese ravioli , but it was by far the best ravioli i 've had in vegas .
i am so happy that we took a chance and tried this place .
they 've have bad customer service . i like filipino food do n't get me wrong only if they improve their service .
her response , `` sure , if you want to wait '' .
great wine and cocktail menu .
service was exceptional - genuinely friendly and happy staff will definitely be back
yes , i know its dancing water with stupid light bulbs shining through .
sat at the bar , damn , those seats are uncomfortable .
i did n't find it being that spicy at all , it was more like regular popcorn chicken with the taiwanese seasoning plus some spicy powder on top .
they are also a walk up window and only have a few outdoor stools and tables to dine at , so be sure to be dressed accordingly with the weather if you decided to stay and eat there .
we were given 2 free rounds of shots : a raspberry lemon drop and a chocolate cake , and both were delicious !
it is reasonably priced i think .
i got the wide flat noodles ( as opposed to the thin rice noodles ) so not sure if that made a huge difference because it was the flavor that did n't make me swoon . you can definitely physically feel the heat of the dish but i did n't think there was much flavor .
there conversation was annoying ; 4 hipsters droning on and on about stupid stuff .
late night at work , late from the gym , and hungry .
prices here are very reasonable .
there conversation was annoying ; 4 hipsters droning on and on about stupid stuff .
i do n't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine .
good food but horrible and slow service .
the lighting was a bit bright but what you gon na do ? i 'm too full to write a full review .
there is nowhere in the gta now a days you can get that amount of seafood that good for such a price , $ 15 pp .
we . he led in late saturday .
anyways , i tried the dish out and it tasted terrible - did n't even finish half .
my husband and i love this little place .
seriously , the food cost is just as expensive as the fine dinning restaurant on the strip .
we did order some margaritas and again they were n't bad just your typical margarita .
atmosphere was calm and clean .
i 'm so glad i found this jewel .
saki bombers are naturally my drink of choice and i was happy when the menu said a large kirin ichiban and saki was only $ 5.75 .
they have a nice selection of bourbon and whiskey cocktails as well as beer and wine . their salads look incredible as does their signature chicken and waffles dish .
this place was right by the walgreen 's i was at , so i stopped in to get some food to go .
at $ 79 for their `` buffet '' and $ 40 for all you can drink mimosa , bloody mary and well drinks , this place comes with a steep price tag .
the drinks were good as well . prices were right and i stuck with the strawberry mojito on special while my fella got a beer as well as a mai tai that he enjoyed for the most part .
pretty lame spot . not worth the $ $ .
expensive but excellent wine list .
cost is a little higher , but not bad .
final creation was the chicken , scallops , shrimp and lobster for the main course .
their steaks are fantastic , but that 's to be expected if you are paying $ 60+ for your steak . great atmosphere and excellent service .
apps are great too , such as the tostones w/ beans and the empanadas which are on the small side but delish and reasonably priced .
i got my beer and i ordered dos equis but they brought another kind , but beer was beer and need beer in me .
i strongly recommend . enjoy !
the wine was delicious , of course .
the ingredients were crispy fresh and the flavors were perfectly put together .
decent amount of food for the price and everything is fairly good . the sashimi here is good & the scallop appetizer was great !
friend ordered the beef teriyaki which was pretty boring and did n't have any vegetables .
stark plain purposeful decoration but it 's cool ... the food is what matters .
no table cloths , fake candles on the table and a rest room that is like one in a applebee 's .
so take a relaxing day and have a late lunch , a drink , and take in the relaxing sunny landscape .
no napkins ! only gave us 1 small cup of ranch for all the food we ordered and when i asked for more ranch he said `` yeah sure '' then started helping the person behind me without ever giving me more ranch .
the fried devil eggs and shrimp salad were awesome .
5 ) club level heavy base `` serenade '' by white snake , guns and roses and unknown others over the sound system was just plain annoying and weird for a nice supper .
not bad - but i 've had better .
i had never been to a restaurant where the owner came and greeted tables and told me `` if there is anything you 'd like that 's not on the menu , let us know and i 'm sure we could make it for your liking '' .
4 stars because i was not thrilled with the slaw or rice- but it was a taste preference not quality issue .
damn , that place is good . price is decent .
service was personable and the restaurant was very clean . great job !
what a gorgeous facility where ever you go here .
the drinks , they were made well , but at $ 4.75 for well on happy hour - it really did n't make me very happy at all .
i tried their cheese ravioli this time and it 's so amazing ! the sauce is wonderful !
horrible service ! not friendly .
i was very unhappy about it . also the server was extremely rude and was not nice at all and did n't understand english well .
this place is great !
when i walked in i was greeted by a very friendly lady who had my take out order all ready to go and the total was $ 18 and change .
we waited about 5 minutes for 2 drinks when there was only one other table in the place taken and they had already been served .
it was busy so we had to wait at least 15 minutes to be seated . we did n't wait long to get our food though : )
despite the shoe , the food was actually ok , but not amazing .
tap water there is terrible but is kind of necessary when drinking cocktails .
if you like watching the kitchen this is also a great place to sit .
the environment is kind of cool because the menu is written in chalk on the walls .
wr started with the oxtail risotto and crispy chicken skins , both were amazing .
the worse injera i have ever eaten in my entire life and the shiro was so bad i had to spit it out .
both were excellent and chased down with a nice glass of pinot grigio .
their drink menu is amazing .
they are made with agave and were wonderful !
my friends and i had a really enthusiastic and nice server .
the prices are high here -- $ 17 for the beef pho .
last of all , my waiter ... started off pretty creepy ... like gon na poison your food and then you wake up in a basement type of creepy .
i love this place .
have a wonderful lunch today with my team .
avoid it if at all possible .
i would highly recommend this spot for any nice night out occasion .
they only had three flavors of beer and all of them were unknown to a beer drinker .
the prices are very reasonable with most dishes under $ 10 .
the service was extremely poor and the staff and management was rude .
they have good drinks here including thirst quenching soft drinks . love their pineapple sauce .
one does not visit the dubliner for an amazing sit-down meal and 5-star service ; you come for light beer and shots , the live music , and the neighborhood crowd .
wine selection was nice too .
the broth was disgusting and the noodles were old .
i do n't believe the mushrooms were washed because my food had this weird dirt taste to it . the chicken was so overlooked i could n't chew it .
as i was walking to the door , i could n't help but notice the extreme buildup of dust and black grime on the lighting fixtures and vents .
you wo n't be sorry eating here .
the bottled beer was nice and cold but my friend thought the tap beer was not nearly cold enough .
the last meal we enjoyed consisted of a chicken avocado sandwich and the voodoo tuna .
our server , fernando , was attentive and extremely knowledgeable .
the beer selection was pretty poor so i ended up with a whiskey cocktail instead .
prices are very reasonable .
as for the wine list , there are great selections by the glass or the bottle .
total was $ 17 and some change .
reasonable prices as well .
all were just ok. i found the meat dry and seemed like it could have been sitting in a pot for a hours .
and the pool was right across the street !
the wine list was extensive and the wait staff was very attentive .
any time a server delivers your margarita with , `` i 'm a terrible bartender because i like drinking too much .
love this place ! from the food to the drinks to the service , this place is great in every way .
cheap prices too , never have more than a $ 40 bill for 2 ( $ 3 a taco ) . i come here probably once a month
i think everyone at our table had either wine or beer ( they have an ok beer selection , but nothing fancy , and only bottles ) .
( they forgot what were the specials of the day ) food : okay the food was the disappointing part .
i am not sure i will take the chance with breakfast .
it was very weird service , and the lighting was terrible .
good service and live music is a plus .
whole staff is terrible all the tables are dirty .
we ordered faux ( bland ) , fajitas ( bland ) , tacos ( bad ) , even the tortillas were served cold as if they just took them out of the bag . the cilantro fries were ok. i 'd leave zero stars if it was n't for the server who was nice .
i 'm sure you 'll love it just as much as i do !
being in a rush i did not have time to check my food before leaving but i should n't have to just to make sure what i ordered was correct .
i would n't say it 's overly authentic , but everything that i 've had here was absolutely delicious and at a very reasonable price . i would highly recommend their sampler platter for 2 , it 's a great way to taste a little bit of everything .
dark awkward feeling in there .
i ordered the hummus , it was excellent .
my boyfriend ordered grilled king salmon which was excellent .
they had a pretty decent beer selection from what i recall . additionally they offered wine selections .
the drinks were great .
did n't get a drink but looked like a nice selection of beers on tap .
i mean , i guess the decor makes it upscale ?
even one of the draft beers was bad !
the other chicken joint ) tender chicken with crunchy skin , excellent fries , & garlic bread !
have been many times with family & friends , and have never been disappointed !
i was rushed to order although the wings came quick . i would not recommend the dry wings as it was totally bland and lacked the `` lemon pepper '' flavour .
good bar to drink at ... but maybe not eat at
the beer menu was pretty weak . they did n't have much on tap and the bottle selection was just as poor .
they had some great drinks on draft that tasted like beer .
i did not eat anything else in that time frame , and i was n't sick , so food poisoning is suspected .
based on my experience during a quiet workday during lunch , i think this is a pretty decent place ; i came here recently with some coworkers for lunch and really enjoyed my time here .
the pastrami was served hot , but only the meat was heated and i have to say i really like it that way .
very disappointed . i will not be returning to this establishment .
the waitress told me to seat anywhere and the table was not clean .
the butter chicken is amazing , it 's my absolute favourite butter chicken .
unfortunately , it tasted completely different to me now . i 'm not sure if it was because i got tofu instead of pork or if it 's a new recipe .
nice place for a beer or few while sitting on their sidewalk patio .
the only bad thing is they remodeled this place and they did a horrible job .
the lights were beautifully strung and the communal seating welcomes large and small parties alike .
the passion iced tea is so refreshing and it came with unlimited refills !
it looks so silly .
we ordered something else and after an hour we were told that the kitchen was running behind and she would let us know when it would be coming .
atmosphere is friendly decor and bathrooms are clean and up to date .
it 's also located in a very charming part of town , close to notre dame and art galleries .
the atmosphere was good , the food was fantastic and the service was quick and professional .
for dinner , i had the tom yum and my husband had orange chicken . both were delicious !
the prices are higher , but you get what you pay for ; exceptional service and quality .
not a good place to go for a work lunch .
all were melt in your mouth good .
it 's cafeteria-style and the restaurant itself is beautiful .
no exchanges , refunds , gift cards , have a nice day , do n't choke , nothing .
we ordered eggs benedict , chili verde huevos rancheros , green chili pork ( if i remember the name correctly ) . my out of town guests finished all their food and agreed that everything was delicious so that 's definitely a win .
not a bad try for $ 20/person .
the only reason to come is to drink beer out of the schooner glasses but alas they only have crap beer on tap .
give me a wood chair , tacky thai paintings or sculptures any day , because i know i will be able to trust the food .
we asked for ranch and only one was given for two people .
the drinks are strong .
prices are cheap also .
food is ok. the flavor is ok.. nothing special .
dishes are beautiful and very tasty .
nothing was really good , in fact some dishes were horrible !
oh drinks were wonderful too .
the price is reasonable too !
ambiance : ( read below ) upscale yet tacky at the same time .
they have some fun items on the menu , including a flaming dessert and some great salads . they have some good deals on the happy hour , including a carafe of sangria - the sangria is pretty sugary however , so do n't order it if you like a more traditional wine sangria .
all around decent meal , decent service but for the price you 're paying i 'd go elsewhere .
the service was great , and the restaurant was fairly comfortable with table seating .
it 's a big space , and clean , but with that vague hint that maybe all of the patterns and colors are hiding uncomfortable amounts of dirty .
great food & drinks .
excellent service . went in during happy hour , which was definitely a peak time for the establishment , and was pleased to receive very prompt and attentive servers !
they said sorry for the wrong size and a large will be coming out shortly .
bad : the decor .
this was also 20 something . peach belini was refreshing and delicious .
for about $ 25 per person , this place is just okay ! you pretty much get what you pay for !
they barely had any beers on tap , had no jack daniels , but did make a pretty good moscow mule .
the food is really really good . try the steamed dumplings and the ginger chicken .
when my friend and i got there , the decor inside was nice but seemed a little dark , so i ended up sitting outside on to the patio by some beautiful flowers .
it 's not like the prices are cheap , the bill was quite high at the end of the night .
there 's no hard liquor , just beer and wine .
the service here is really friendly and they are always happy to see you .
ordered a couple happy hour drinks and snacks ... . they were out of potstickers ... my favorite .
hand crafted cocktails were excellent but a bit overpriced for an off strip bar beer taps were down for repair but there were ipas and other bottle and canned options .
it was dark in there , and usually good things happen at darkly lit , hip places ( err ... or bad things , depends on your skewed interpretations ) .
all of the options are inventive and expertly made .
kfc chicken is better than what they gave us and it was even the worse fried chicken ever i 've tasted . the salad was a nothing special .
wow , what a hot mess .
i had the beet salad and a vodka spiked arnold palmer . the food was delicious and service was good .
great food and great service ! drive thru gets a bit long during lunch hours but it goes really fast !
the wine list was great .
i asked the bartender what kind of tequila it was , they had no clue !
we asked what was in the margaritas as in what kind of tequila and the bartender responded `` everything is tequila based like every margarita '' .
i get a curry every time ( the masaman is my favorite ! )
the mixed greens salad was excellent , and the bison was outstanding .
the beer i got ( which was the cheapest on tap besides miller lite ) was not bad .
highly recomend on the architecture alone .
the cowboy beans are delicious and the salad bar has the best very cold crunchy romaine .
no draft beers which was a bummer , but still a decent selection of bottled beers .
whenever i 'm able to stop by here , i do .
if i were paying $ 20 ( full price per person ) , i would have given 2 stars .
i highly recommend stopping in for lunch or breakfast .
neither of my beers were apparently classified for happy hour .
all of this for a measly $ 7.25 ?
the concept for this place is great , the feel is very cool .
great place to grab a bite at the phoenix airport .
the space was very cool and service was on point .
that is the only way to enjoy this place ! the food is awesome and the wait staff is generally friendly .
it 's down this weird concrete hallway that make you feel like you might get jumped or raped in there .
all and all , everything was pretty tasteless !
its a small dining room in need of some tlc ( did n't appear dirty , but decoration wise ) .
very cool building and great food and service !
beer and margaritas available , not sure about any other alcohol .
has lunch specials which are decently priced , but they are n't anything special .
the food was decent but not great for the price you pay .
that 's awesome customer service . i 'm a fan .
their prices are reasonable and we felt a good value .
maybe it 's not filthy - maybe it 's just the lighting and decor that makes it look like that way .
right now it 's just a cool neighborhood gathering place with bad food and mediocre beer .
my chicken came out and when i bit into it i realized the chicken was still raw .
super meaty and chilled just right and oh , so good downed with a pint of $ 5 sapporo .
i have eaten here often and can confidently say this place is a true gem in new toronto .
do n't pass up this awesome spot when visiting the burgh .
baked potato was a perfect side kick .
some vegis hard but otherwise very good .
i never have to force myself to drink anything with tequila in it , but their house margarita just did n't taste right .
it is really sad that the service to the customer is not important especially when the restaurant is empty .
but worse than the food was the poor lighting in this new place . horrible florescent bulbs give the place the look of a morgue .
very tasty and hits the spot on a lazy afternoon .
their pizzas are very fresh and tasty , and the poutine is cooked to order .
prices are good too .
price : very cheap .
the portions are huge . the chicken pot pie is comically huge and delicious .
they were very good , almost no filler and all crab so i was n't too upset about the size .
the sandwich finally comes , i pick it up and oh no , the bottom bread is all soggy .
prices are pretty decent and good portions .
the mojito was very good .
great food , service and atmosphere . only complaint is it 's upstairs and hard to find entrance .
the light is cool , but the audio sounds a little bit not well tuned that you will feel really noise .
this is n't tacky , it looks good .
the bad : for starters , it 's a very tight space .
the breakfast was filling , piping hot , and delicious .
we ordered sparkling sake , recommended by our waiter , and it was delicious . we also ordered hot sake later on in the evening .
beers were good ( even though they didnt have any beer specials ) ... hmmmm .
love the homemade pasta ( bigoli is my favorite ) .
nonetheless , the chicken was delicious .
authentic tex-mex food that will fill your belly and not break the bank . i highly recommend the hot salsa but they also have a mild version too .
draft beer selection was not extensive , but they offered tastings ( poured more than fairly ) and the beers they had were really good .
i do n't drink beer , but my friends do and they said their beers were just ok , nothing spectacular .
i love that all the soups are made from scratch .
food was delicious and the service was great too . i had the burger , pork buns and my friend had the mac n cheese and everything was delicious .
i like the atmosphere but honestly had a bad feeling after our encounter with the hostess .
i do n't think $ 15 dollars for a burger is extremely overpriced .
the prices are high as well .
the vibe there is amazing and offers a cosy interior and a great patio . the best thing about this place is the staff is super friendly and personable .
but we were never asked if we enjoyed the food or if we would like another soft drink or more water .
i have had the chicken club which was good although the bun was pretty soggy when i got it .
there 's a nice drink selection & an awesome happy hour .
the pizza is very expensive and in my opinion not worth it .
be prepared to drop over $ 100 especially if you get cocktails and desert ... but it 's worth it .
i was very surprised !
huge portions ( leftovers guaranteed ) !
the decor is very nice.. very stylish and contemporary .
food is good for the prices .
although we did n't try a margarita , they do have a pretty good beer selection .
pricing is good and quality is good .
and at $ 9 a pop , they are n't exactly the best bargains , but pretty decent to hit the spot if you 're craving it .
they forgot to give me a straw and seemed annoyed that i even asked for one .
a cute little place off the busy street .
perfect for a lovely one on one conversation .
the food was delicious and moderately priced .
our waitess did n't even say good bye or have a good night .
the prices are very good also .
do n't bother going , unless you just want the flashing lights and loud animals .
the total for the food was around $ 20 which is perfect .
happy hour prices were very reasonable for our beer and cocktail .
i had to ask for salt and pepper to make my food taste even remotely appetizing .
i had never been inside the inn zone , but stopped in for a late breakfast .
when i told her the food was cold she says well i know they just walked out of here with the pizza and it was just made .
also tried one of their specialty lavender cocktails , which was delightful for the senses .
price was a bit high .
it doesnt matter , but the dining room is kind of ugly .
there is not one but two bars that serve 32 beer and ale on tap , 33 bottled beer , and an impressive selection of wine and liquor .
for $ 5 you wo n't be disappointed .
there was some kind of school band demo going on which would have been fine except it was unnecessarily and extremely loud !
i guess this is an ok stop if you know what you are going for . but we have experienced only slow service , and mediocre food
that 's as cheap as it gets .
while we did not drink any booze , they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers , wine , and specialty cocktails .
the price was very reasonable .
i enjoyed the beef and pork more as i am not a spicy fiend .
it 's nice to have a specialty coffee house nearby ! the atmosphere is clean and simple , and seems like a nice place to work or chat .
it 's reasonably priced .
the cheese was unmelted , cold and really ruined our meal .
with drinks and tip , dinner for two can easily cost close to $ 200 .
open table reservations worked great as always , and we indulged with some moscow mules and wonderful beers .
it 's pretty reasonably priced as well .
another amazing meal . started with a fantastic raspberry cocktail .
a nice quiet place with good food .
my suggestion is to order take out , because then you do n't have to deal with the long wait due to terrible service .
the prices where pretty cheap and reasonable as well .
my only concern though is the lighting .
ask for a tall drink and u will enjoy your drink much more for only $ 3 more bucks .
beer - the beer selection was nothing special and they do n't serve it in a cold glass .
the food is really cheap too .
not a good value for almost $ 6 .
when the restaurant is silent , if feels weird talking because it sounds so loud .
good ambience , moderately priced .
prices are very reasonable .
there is hardly ever a genuine greeting or acknowledgement when you enter the place .
i guess it 's too difficult to just scoop beans and rice in a tortilla .
the rice was good , until we found a hair in it .
it 's so fluorescent bright in there it feels like you 're being interrogated .
the vesper martini is still good i had a sauvignon blanc and petit sirah , both good .
it was a last minute reservation but i am so glad i came here .
the atmosphere was nice and i love the stylish decor .
everyone is nice and friendly .
they refused to turn off the loud music which in a industrial space is even louder .
the inside was very clean and you can see the kitchen from the dining area because it 's separated by a big window and glass .
their coffee is also some of the best coffee i 've tasted , full bodied and rich and roasted to perfection .
prices are very reasonable . the atmosphere is fairly plain .
if my order was $ 80 and i only had a $ 100 bill , would they make me go to one of the banks and change it ?
they have wifi so you can camp out here and it is a great meeting spot if you are on the henderson side of town . i also love their indoor garden .
not sure if they are using fluorescent bulbs but the lighting messes with my eyes and gives me a slight headache .
the service is horrible .
there were no pieces of chicken for that matter .
she was extremely rude , i did n't want to make a scene so i kept on eating that thing . but god was she rude talking to me as if i was claiming free food .
i was excited to check this place out on my last visit but that 's about as far as it goes .
it 's kind of depressing .
it was a strange mix of random music and patches of awkward silence .
the prices are pretty much on point .
this is about the only thing the waitress did n't mess up .
the sweet tea is fire get the muddy water ( arnold palmer for the city folks ) .
at $ 18 it 's a bit on the expensive side , but as you can easily spend the same or more at burger bar i 'd rather spend it here .
i had a pour of good rye whisky , a good pairing with one of their excellent burgers .
not bad and they had a great selection of beers on tap and mixed drinks and wine .
when we told the waiter that we thought 45 dollars fee for not ordering an entree was ridiculous , he said `` let me check with the manager . ''
the rachel collins was my cocktail of choice and it was very good !
i highly recommend their pineapple drink .
the champagne sangria was the specialty drink of the evening , and boy was it amazing .
sat at the bar for my first night in montreal while here on business and it was a perfect end to a day of travel .
time limit on how long you have the table under extremely cramped conditions .
and a killer happy hour to top it all off !
terrible ... .when we told them they offered a $ 5 off coupon .
like fluorescent lighting that casts ugly shadows across one 's face .
however , this limitation is not surprising considering the lunch buffet is all you can eat and it 's only $ 10 per person .
just look at the lettuce they gave me . it 's like they do n't even care lol i would have gave them another star but their customer service was pretty poor as well
great pizzas ! very tasty .
the designer did a great job in selecting the light fixtures , colour scheme , furniture , etc .
this buffet seemed like a good deal in that it was only about 35 dollars .
however , i was n't thrilled with my chicken sandwich . the bin was soggy and it was lacking something .
the staff was friendly and attentive although service was a bit spotty .
good food horrible service .
: - ) the first thing i notice is they asked if i am willing to share a table with other random customers .
awesome view- make sure you go when you can watch the sunset .
it is also cheap .
once again , no employees checked our tickets and we had to wander to find our movie . we were able to order sooner , however this time our food did n't come out until 1015 minutes before the movie was over .
stella 's is an absolute gem right off of st. clair w. the inside looks like a comfy , but hip living room with a fabulous coffee bar staffed by the friendliest of people .
the beef was very good . however , everything else tasted a bit bland , and i found the soup base a bit plain as well .
horrible customer service . never again .
the food was pretty good . but the employees and manager were extremely unprofessional .
the patio offers a great view of montreal while you enjoy the amazing meal ahead .
the bell guy told me they were planning on renovating the entire hotel and i hope they do .
they were delightfully served in martini glasses , but that was the only good thing about them .
the lighting was a little bright but maybe that 's just me .
did n't drink , but good draft selection . reccomended .
it was a bit of a splurge as 2 drinks and 2 appetizers came to almost $ 50 but very good quality food and drink .
the margarita was perfect and one was enough .
this place has great atmosphere , huge portions , fair prices , and they pour a solid pint .
the restaurant is huge and i saw a large group of office people celebrating a birthday and there were also some families having dinner .
not nearly as good as chipotle . the vegetables were not fresh , salsa was mediocre .
the food is n't anything spectacular on its own , but when you realize you only paid $ 5 for it ?
the view is spectacular , the bartender was handsome and poured very liberally . we sat at the booths outside overlooking vegas and it was unbelievable - perfect view , perfect weather , romantic , fun !
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
the place is so dark , all those light bulbs are making the room yellowish , wo n't advice you to check out the washroom either as its pretty horrible .
the customer service was really bad .
the interior decor was super cute and they had a nice waiting area in case you did have to wait .
i could n't believe that it only cost us $ 5 .
very fresh donuts , warm and friendly staff , spacious and sunny area for sitting and enjoying your bites of heaven while leisurely sipping your coffee .
beer was nice big but no cold glass .
taste decent ! not bad at all .
one of our favorite date night places ! great food , service and atmosphere .
the staff was really friendly , the atmosphere casual and there was a nice outdoor patio as well .
it was a very nice restaurant , and especially on a sunny day if you enjoy outdoor dinning .
and did i mention that the margarita was very weak ? i think the bartender forgot the tequila .
i am so very excited to see another healthy food location open up in the neighborhood .
it 's a nice cozy environment .
the decor was a little dated and outright weird to say the least .
not a good place for wine , but about 30 draft beers .
bad news ... and after the 10-12 min wait for food , everything tastes like it had 4 pounds of salt on it ( cheeseburgers and chicken rings ) .
he agreed that what they are putting forth as ipa is a joke and is but one reason why they are doing so poorly .
the soup base that they use has no msg but is so flavourful and just makes the noodles that much better .
this is my favorite restaurant in vegas . i always go when i visit .
not sure if they are using fluorescent bulbs but the lighting messes with my eyes and gives me a slight headache .
the big mamma sub was lukewarm , the mozzarella was still in cold sliced form .
the grilled chicken is surprisingly juicy and flavorful .
the only downside was a reasonably steep price , but you 'll get at least two meals ' worth of food
strike 1. atmosphere is n't just lacking , it 's downright awkward and uncomfortable .
rating primarily for vibe , character of the place , location , and nice staff . great place to study .
not the cheapest cheap chinese food around , but delicious for what it is and good value for the price .
ok , my bad .
in all honesty the place does give off a `` hole in the wall '' feeling , and the really outdated decor does n't help .
someone at our table ordered it , it looked great .
hands down the best food , for a great meal , and a excellent drink of wine .
everyone happy and full ! service welcoming and thorough .
also , happy hour prices or not this place is affordable , and serves high quality food .
for two burritos , it was a total of $ 15 .
although it is quite good , it comes with a steep price tag of $ 85 before tax and gratuity .
i ordered the pho tai and i was not all that impressed and maybe it was the fact that i was full from stuffing my face with the appetizers , but i felt it lacked flavor .
only downside is that beach club grill has gotten quite pricey as our tab that night was almost $ 90 .
it 's so fluorescent bright in there it feels like you 're being interrogated .
i was full off this plate - $ 18 .
prices are very reasonable .
a 10 dollar breakfast as it should be ; )
very limited options and tasteless food .
food is okay but not impressive . the price is high .
horrible experience the room was dirty when i arrived and all the systems were down so check in was a hassle .
this place is ok. the tables and chairs are a bit uncomfortable and the food is definitely not for everyone .
i know i can count on a special experience here when i take friends or family out for a special occasion .
at $ 20 a pop a real disappointment .
dinner at byblos last night was a wonderful intro to toronto .
it was really creepy .
i had a baked mac and cheese with a side of house salad . the mac and cheese was great .
and reasonably priced for the quality of food .
our favorite place to get pizza ! the ingredients taste so fresh and the crust is amazing .
unfortunately , i do n't drink beer .
the food is good , priced right ( actually cheap ) , and fast .
it might sound weird , but check out the bathrooms .
delicious variety of food , good drinks . everything tastes very authentic and the staff is really nice too .
you will not be disappointed .
i felt the cost was a bit on the high side , just over $ 100 for the two of us .
i will never go to this place again after the horrific customer service a couple of members of our party received .
scallops were also really good .
it 's kind of annoying when you see employees just standing around talking while customers are waiting .
their braised chicken is very enjoyable .
draft beer selection was not extensive , but they offered tastings ( poured more than fairly ) and the beers they had were really good .
u wo n't go wrong with fried dumping .
the venue is clean , bright and satisfying just like the menu , which is packed with burritos , nachos , healthy bowl options , stacked tater tots and of course tacos . the tacos here are the bomb and very filling .
that 's cool - unless you write `` freaky fast '' all over your walls ; - )
we probably had 15 or 16 super premium margaritas and david measured out the ratios , had fresh squeezed juice and each glass was chilled and salted perfectly ; some of the best that i have had in a very long time .
we spent $ 120 only to be thrown out .
even had the manager share a bottle of wine with us ! a memorable evening .
one night , the employees actually felt so bad about turning us away again ( they recognized our disappointed faces all too well by this point ) that they called the owner to try and convince him to stay open for us because they knew we would make the store a profit and help them to make some loyal customers . nope .
drinks are expensive but is n't that expected .
great simple sandwiches with a great price tag . good size too .
i usually find raw fish unappetizing but i loved their salmon ! it wasnt slimy or anything and had a really great texture .
the prices are also a bit high .
happy hour menu includes beer , food and cocktails at a discount . fried cauliflower was the best !
the chicken wrap was bomb ! it had huge chunks of chicken and the flavor was on point- i will be back !
the server was extremely nice however the food did n't help .
sad to say , but nacho daddy has lost my business for not honoring their own advertising and consistent poor service .
watermelon drink is to die ! love .
but , it was also somewhat bland .
decor is bad though lol
an overhead ceiling fan would have made the entire difference ... just a note .
i did no drink one , but apparently the margaritas were pretty good and not a bad deal by the pitcher .
it 's this combo that comes with pad thai or cashew chicken as a main ( both delicious ) and a mango salad that i always switch for green , a big spring roll , and hot and sour soup which i always switch for the chicken coconut milk soup ( unreal ) .
i feel like this place should have died with the 80s , it 's creepy alright .
however , the staff is extremely unpleasant .
the prices are relatively cheap and affordable , with a decent amount of bang for ur buck .
with its popular reputation , upbeat atmosphere and good food , this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town .
$ 12 for a beer ridiculous .
prices for appetizers were old school - modestly priced , that is .
i ate here the morning after a horrible over priced meal that consisted of lobster and spaghetti .
seasoning was non existent and grease was plentiful . the pizza my fiance ordered , while crisp and cooked thoroughly , was bland and uneventful .
not wanting to spend $ 35+ per person at a buffet on the strip we decided to give krazy buffet a try and it hit the spot for only $ 12 !
if we had n't driven 18 miles there one way i would have walked out right then & taken my money elsewhere .
i ordered the kimchi ramen soup base is ok , noodle could be better . 4/5 mediocre .
almost forgot about my terrible coronarita ... cheap margarita mix in a normal drinking glass with a corona sticking out .
it 's a bar and bait shop so stop here if you are on your way to lake pleasant .
the people and the place were really nice , with plants and terrace at the front and the inside felt really cozy . i recommend !
such a great vibe .
it is a great addition to the atmosphere .
the only thing that i found ( slightly ) bothersome was that the lighting was a little too dark .
it 's also a popular spot with locals .
this is not a flashy , beautiful restaurant .
i ordered the margarita which was very refreshing and not sweet at all ! it was the perfect drink for a hot summers night .
a few things that marcus did not mention : - the ( complimentary ) buddha bread and eggplant dip ; a nice little starter to whet our appetites - the side order of shishito peppers that we ordered as a starter - delicious with just the right amount of kick - the pork belly fried rice ( i did n't have any but jared loved it ! )
the dining room itself had the potential to be cool , but instead felt cluttered .
food was really good and cheap .
it 's got some weird industrial theme going on , but it does n't feel too dirty .
it 's kind of tacky .
china go-go ... do n't be turned off by the simple and relatively awkward decor .
i did n't try the beer , but it looked like decent alcohol choices .
with lots of downtime that could lead to really , really awkward conversation .
but i 'm not paying $ 46 for the dessert only !
- décor - it is beautiful in here .
i ordered another drink as the beer flight was hardly anything .
everything must be downed with a cup of warm tea .
the only negative i would say was that the hostess/waitress was unfriendly , and always seemed in a rush which made it hard to relay i needed a refill on my drink while she ran by me .
food is a super value too -- high quality and generous portions for the price .
oh , the orders also came with a wine pairing which was very memorable .
truth be told , we spent a good 4 hours there on a very cold and rainy sunday ( restaurant was empty and we tipped well ) .
additionally , the draft beer was only slightly chilled .
hopefully , they will get the opportunity to visit hawaii , california , or new york city to get some decent sushi .
it 's fantastic . the sauce is what i remember from childhood , the pasta is just right , but the meatballs definitely steal the show .
$ 10 and change , not bad .
chicken sandwich was dry . the veggi burger sounded amazing but was flavorless .
the only reason we went here was because we couldnt get into any kind other restaurant .
one of my favorite restaurants . we 've been going to these restaurants for 20 years .
intimate interior , outdoor seating in the courtyard ; what more could you ask for ? it 's great to have them in the neighborhood .
what a great place .
prices were very reasonable but an even better deal if you can still score the groupon .
the atmosphere is awesome and the food was great . our server was engaging and made sure everything with our meal was great .
we got the highly recommended garlic prawns and crispy duck panang , and it was perfect for 2 ! the prawns were so good you can eat the fried shells as well , and the duck panang was so rich and delicious i did n't want to leave any of it behind .
the decor is classy and sophisticated . its perfect for a date .
i found the price a bit high for the quality .
we ordered the linguica as an appetizer and it was very good , having it flamed table-side was a great plus . i ordered the paella and it was much more than i could eat and packed with a nice variety of seafood plus chicken and sausage .
they did n't have any beer on tap , only select few bottles which was disappointing .
i would reccomend this place to people only on special occasions solely based on the price ( $ 200 bill for 2 people ) unless you 're loaded with money .
carbonara is my favourite dish and they make a fabulous creamy carbonara .
the restaurant is pretty tiny and has a cramped feeling , but it 's still nice .
i love this place .
i took a look at the beer list and was pretty impressed , as they had at least fifteen different beers on tap , plus i think that they had a bottled beer list as well .
what a nice , quiet , cozy spot to unwind after a long day .
their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers .
i figured i would try it since it 's so hard to find a good wing place .
parents and husband love it !
the service in there is some of the worst for a restaurant chain . the food is alright but does n't make up for the lack of service .
took advantage of the 2-5pm happy hour and enjoyed a couple drinks .
be careful because it is too easy to spend a lot of $ $ here .
the owner is very nice and helpful .
$ 12 for water is extreme even at a high end steakhouse .
food prices are good but the drink prices are way too high .
the noodles had the perfect bite ( in my opinion ) and the skewers were hot and juicy without being overly seasoned .
the food is good , but the portions are small and the prices are high .
we ordered the pork belly appetizer and mac and cheese ... delicious !
service was fast and friendly .
they did a great job !
do not recommend it . bathrooms very dirty looked like someone threw up in the men 's sink .
the room was comfortable and affordable .
which has a cool view of the strip .
there was just a huge line to order , a while to wait , a number system that did n't seem to be in any order so you really had to pay attention , and no where to sit .
we had the best server christina who was very friendly and attentive . and their manager stephanie was very courteous making sure everything was ok. definitely will be returning .
really expensive for what it is . $ 180 for two couples to eat .
when you add in all of the tattoos , nose rings , ear discs and other face jewelry it just gives a trashy look to an otherwise beautiful restaurant .
you can keep your place of business , no one likes rude manager on top of lack of food to sell .
maybe it was the off night but , both of us ordered penne primavera and both of us thought that it lacked significantly in flavour .
great place to chill and watch a game ... its right across the street from where the suns play .
the delivery service , on the other hand , wow ... i ordered $ 14 worth of food online , and only had $ 3 in change for a tip .
mixed drinks are awesome , especially sangria .
there is no denying the strong curry taste , but was not overpowering .
the specials are reasonable in price . the quality shows .
i did n't order a drink because they only had cuervo as far as tequila at the outside bar . the food was ok not great but just fine .
thought the name meant beer or good drinks . beers were pricey .
even with an occasional free breakfast due to punchcard , this place is off our rotation . cold food , unfriendly servers and managers .
they had a good selection of bottled beers but nothing on tap .
i have been here many , many times and i am always very pleased !
i come in here every chance i get , they 're my favorite italian place ! if i did n't live so far i 'd be in here everyday !
worst chipotle in town ... slow service ... 4 workers ca n't handle 10 people in 30 mins ... and cashier asked what my order was three times ! food was ok ... there portions are smaller or the people do n't know how to make can burrito
it was difficult to read with light bouncing off at that angle .
coffee was great . the atmosphere was nice , well lit because of the high large windows .
the sashimi is fresh and there is quite a selection . the rolls are equally good .
i 've had better and i 've had worse .
the ambiance is good . the place has a good variety of buffet .
we went for latenight happy hour . it started at 9. half price on select apps and alcohol .
yes , they are very , very expensive but that 's the price you pay for a 5 star restaurant .
super reasonably priced and quality food .
it was good , not greasy .
great selection for a decent price .
just spoke to his coworker and after he got whatever it was he needed , finally turned around and waved . there was only one decent person and she was the cashier , she smiled .
the prices are on the reasonable side .
great place . good atmosphere , quiet , clean .
i 've been addictive to boba lately and it 's been hard to get some late at night , until now !
not only the room was so dated , the carpet was very filthy that you should wear slippers or those surgical booties .
customer service was ok but the food was not all that great maybe if price was 13 or maybe 14 bucks .
the food was pretty cheap , but you could tell . everything tasted like grease , so much so that i finished about 1/4 of my meal and threw it away , and paid for it the rest of the afternoon with an upset stomach .
i started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila .
we were seated and then asked to move our table , move my purse , move my child so that the waitress staff could fit in behind us .
it was good , but way to expensive it cost 19 dollars for 2 waffles .
sushi is fresh and creative .
a little ghetto , but smart .
even the sampler is only $ 8 for four , $ 4 pours .
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
the husband got what he always loved here , the pear & gorgonzola pizza and i got the veggie grilled sandwich with tortilla soup and mediterranean veggie rolls for appetizers .
it was delicious and reasonably priced .
open walls are great when the weather is nice .
i usually get a beer and as much as i enjoy a cold mug of beer i do wish i could get a cold pint glass of beer .
the seating is much better ; however , the service can be terrible at times .
it 's not cheap but they are not cheap on the serving sizes and quality .
when we go , we 'll spend hours sitting and enjoy the breeze off the lake . such a beautiful restaurant and and we 've made tonnes of great memories there .
also , the interior reminds me of disneyland for some reason ... it 's disturbingly tacky .
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
and of course , the name long wong 's is a funny name that conjures up a lot of snickering and off color jokes .
for what they make in wages and tips they could try to fake it .
we love the happy hour with vintage drinks and yummy appetizers . the decor is modern yet comfortable with a nice outside patio .
not muddled properly , and it tasted like gin not rum ... .let 's try the nachos ... .hmmm canned guac , canned jalapeño , and add chicken that is cold and cut up from the night before . at least the spotted beer glasses are cold ... .
the fries were outstanding and you get a generous portion .
but the beer was disappointing .
only good thing is that it is on strip and cheap !
pizza was burnt and cold . it was not properly cut so i had to re cut it .
excellent food , one of the best omelets i have ever had ( spinach , mushroom and jack cheese ) .
incredibly salty , entirely the wrong kind of noodles , the wrong kind of sauce , and worst of all , carrots and broccoli !
the meat was hard and tasteless .
the staff are still in training so they may make some mistakes but the owner or manager i presume is very nice and corrects the issues when you bring it up .
i had the adobo fried rice and my wife country eggs benedict . both cooked perfectly , brought out quickly and tasted very fresh .
usually after they say sorry for the wait everything goes ok but not tonight .
moira has a great list of specialty cocktails and a knock-out sake list with excellent prices .
the experience was awesome to try but to me this place is like a once in a blue moon not one of those places i would go to often . but an awesome first experience if you have never been there !
wonderful flavors and unique drinks , sauces etc .
prices seem a bit high for what you get . you 'll be spending around $ 10 for a pie and a drink .
my wife took her soup to the microwave to get it so it was hot .
the ad says `` any large $ 12 '' and when i create my pizza it comes out with a $ 19.99 price before the delivery charge which brought the total to $ 25 something plus i needed to add the tip .
it was amazing . i ordered the croque monsieur as my entree .
stayed in the resort and was super happy to have this on the 6th floor of the palms place and so close to my room . the decor is fantastic & being poolside it puts it on another level .
i used to love this place .
this restaurant has happy hour all day long and each item was no more than $ 8 !
their drinks were really good ! i tasted their sweeter moscato , which is excellent , and their peach sangria ( it needed more wine ) general info ; they switch their food specials all the time !
reasonable prices and good service .
not sure why , or if it was just an oversight , but the waitress said there was n't one .
love the canadian theme to the food , decor is modern but cozy .
the decor is n't hard on the eyes either .
she did n't address the dead fly or ice and did n't change the drink machine .
almost forgot about my terrible coronarita ... cheap margarita mix in a normal drinking glass with a corona sticking out .
great food at very reasonable prices .
price on food is pretty reasonable , and the drinks are good as well .
unfortunately for approximately $ 17 bucks this was a tad disappointing .
it 's sort of gothic and kind of trendy , but mainly just weird .
a great combination of sweet and savory , i had to finish every last bite , because it was too good to leave on the plate .
i do n't drink beer but the waitress said they had a good selection .
came for happy hour and had the margarita , delicious .
it 's a lot more reasonably priced and more casual .
but he warned , i 'm pretty sure it 's basically margarita flavored beer .
the gal at the door was friendly , but my server seemed almost annoyed by me .
good service , reasonably priced food .
the sushi itself was fine , but nothing special .
i do n't know who did the training for the staff here , but they did an amazing job .
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
good food , fast delivery , but they need to improve training with customer service .
ca n't even rate the food because we never made it that far .
only pro is the price . 7.99 for 2 but you can get this deal elsewhere
the hot sauces were excellent . the staff was nice and very friendly , they were extremely attentive and the facility was spotless .
pair it with a great wine and you 've got an excellent date night : )
i usually get a beer and as much as i enjoy a cold mug of beer i do wish i could get a cold pint glass of beer .
lots of food for a decent price .
i think the bartender may only be good at pouring beer .
it 's $ 18 . i do n't think that 's cheap for about 10 little pieces of pasta without any meat .
i am not a racist by any means but i hate literally eating from small mom and pop operations like this there is no customer service respect or guarantee .
only improvement could be that the wedding soup was slightly under salted .
everything was amazing . the pork belly tacos and ahi tuna skewers were unreal .
the rice was hard and tasted like it came out of a bag !
i thought i was in the wrong line so i asked the cashier for what i wanted . i understand the person behind the counter was working but good customer service will say `` i will be with you shortly '' .
unless you have a thing for weak , tasteless cocktails , i suggest ordering a beer or glass of wine .
ok , 10 dishes to make most likely my beef was cooking under the heat lamp while waiting for the other dishes .
good food , cheap prices .
when i got my wings they were cold and dry .
it took about 45 mins for order to even come , and then the waitress did not get the order right . and she left my burger sitting at the counter for 5 mins before bringing it over so that it could get cold .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
nachos and no beer does not make me happy .
to drink , i wanted to try their berry lemonade , and it was the perfect summer drink .
where else can you get a dinner with good wine for $ 30 .
yeah it 's a little weird layout .
the green chile mac and cheese was incredible ! everything is fresh and so delicious !
the restaurant is a little small , it seats about 60 ish people but it does n't feel crowded , it felt cozy .
plus there non alcoholic beer is excellent as well .
i truly tried to be objective but the eggs benedict with crab was bland , covering equally bland and dry biscuits . the waffles lean heavily on syrup for flavor .
i ordered the traditional breakfast . it was excellent !
when i came inside the cashier was clearing tables and said she would be right with me .
on to the food : maki rolls and hand rolls were okay , i like that there was n't that much rice , but the fact that they were very cold turned me off .
we did take note that they have expanded their beer and wine list which we were very pleased about along with the selections .
( note - the picture is the pad thai with chicken after a couple bites ... sorry , i was hungry )
try the inexpensive rose wine .
cheap and delicious . do n't expect anything fancy .
it 's ridiculous pricing but it 's vegas so it 's to be expected .
i love this place ! i am obsessed .
i understand that we arrived late ( 9 pm ) to the restaurant , because of a party member that had to work late , but the dirty look we got from the hostess and the waiter rushing us and dismissing our questions , provided for an unfriendly environment .
the spinach on my pizza was the frozen kind and extremely watery , which threw off the entire thing .
all of them were dry and needed more flavor .
the decor is n't hard on the eyes either .
when there 's not enough ( and an overload of sauce ) , the whole pizza is disappointing .
delicious food at a reasonable price .
the drinks were decent though there were no beers on tap , only in cans . selection was ok though .
, lousy service , loud , obnoxious singer who could n't carry a tune in a paper bag , way too dark , even with the stupid menu lights , ridiculously overpriced .
the decor is very creative with great art work on the walls makes the whole place look spacious but cozy at the same time .
staffs are nice and caring .
nonetheless , we ordered an order of garlic knots and a large pepperoni pizza for the four of us . both were quite delicious !
both times the staff was attentive and friendly .
beer was just not good .
priced reasonably , but not cheap .
the bathroom walls sadly need a fresh coat of bright paint - the restaurant decor is fine but when you walk into the women 's washroom , you feel like you 've entered into some other grimy business .
the bartender was pretty bad .
i feel like a $ 300 dinner for two should have been a better experience food wise .
i know this might be petty for some but they have these really bumpy tiles on the floor which makes walking with high heels very dangerous .
the result is an uncomfortable hour-long struggle to not slip off the `` stool '' onto the floor !
we had a couple of glasses of wine on happy hour , and ordered some bruschetta which was delicious and a personal margarita pizza also delicious !
i seem to have the worst luck at this location .
both plates with two drinks approximately ( 200 $ ) do n't let the prices fool you expecting something delicious .
service was awesome . everyone was really friendly .
the inside atmosphere is kind of loud . the patio seating is very nice .
dinner for two was $ 35 ( 26 and change + tip ) , so not bad , but that did n't include drinks .
they have good baked baguettes and the price was $ 1.50 last month , however raising the price to $ 2 per roll during the holiday 's is ridiculous .
food was disappointing . shepard 's pie was soupy and mushy .
i 'm not talking about your normal cracks and creeks i 'm talking full on loud construction type noises .
salad bar is reasonable , as is the chaat .
the noodles were n't chewy like how i expected it to taste . bc i 'm so used to eating knife cut noodles , i know what is good vs bad and these were on the bad side of the spectrum .
parking lot is small and does n't have nice outdoor seating like they did at d.c. ranch . the inside is still under work .
the bar has a feel about it that is nice .
this is great place for the noda neighborhood . glad to see something different in the area with a nice vibe , but yet cool enough to relax and enjoy some good food .
great location with the fountain and people watching .
reasonably priced and good service .
its located in the target shopping center by my house so its easy to get here when i have a craving for a dog or two , but there are better options in this immediate area so choose wisely .
also had a huge attitude when we asked him to split up the tab .
it was decent value too , at about $ 12 .
i can not understand why every table in the place was n't full ... it should be every night !
i went on my first night in vegas , and it was the best welcome to town experience i could have ever hoped for !
i 'm no decor expert by any means , but i did n't care for the fake plants and the furniture was lawn chairs .
great menu and very cheap drinks for happy hour .
aesthetically this place is n't the best , however it is good bang for your buck . prices are very reasonably priced and the food is never overly salty or greasy .
crazy setting , amazing prices and value .
this is worth it - the atmosphere beautiful surrounded by live flowers and a light airy atmosphere .
terrible service , owner is something else .
there could be more fish but for the price it 's very fair and still high quality .
we finally made it out today , but we wo n't be returning .
we do not mind paying for a good meal but overall we had a very unpleasant experience .
that and the walls desperately need paint , place just does n't feel clean .
atmosphere is good , but paying almost $ 11.00 for a sandwich that was a massive disappointment was a bummer .
ordered the nachos , which were good except for the beans . they ordered burgers which looked pretty average to me .
oh , and did i mention the drinks are great too ? amazing wine selection and they make a really delicious sangria .
the two sides that came with it were really bad . i had the potatoes au gratin and the sauteed spinach . both were poorly cooked and terribly over salted .
bartender stephanie was amazing ! she made a round of wonderful manhattans , then a spicy red pepper , gin , ginger cocktail that was great .
it 's a very comfortable environment in a great location .
it 's $ 55 well-spent for a great meal .
also the bathroom had torn wallpaper off the wall and the counters were not as clean .
everything seems reasonably priced , and reasonably good .
but once inside , it 's actually modern , sophisticated , elegant , and even a bit fancy .
drinks : i ordered the pineapple cocktail recommended by our waitress and it was sooo delicious !
i was pleasantly surprised ! it was amazing !
the cost almost seems reasonable , this exceptional burger comes in at around $ 13 but that is just the burger , want fries that is another $ 10+ .
the meal was rather expensive for the quality .
he also ordered a margarita which i had a few sips of & it was delicious !
the meat mixture they 're using is flavorful , and has great texture .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
excellent beer bar and not to mention my friend and i were allowed inside to catch the last of dr. dog 's set . what a chill place .
of these , the green was my favorite , although i liked both red salsas as well .
excellent thai food . great jerky , soups and entrees .
the price range of this place is fair i would say .
not having beer descriptions in a beer bar is just wrong .
when we tried to order drinks , the were out of the only draft beer , negro modelo ... and 3-4 of the bottle beers , and my 1st tequila choice ... then the bartender actually told me the hefeweizen bottle beer was `` just '' like the 2x ipa they were out of ... .really ?
there was only the smallest slice of meat on it and all bread .
horrible ... $ 16.99 plus tax for the worst little pizza i 've had in recent memory .
a little on the loud side with not a lot of options for private conversation .
if you order the 18 pack of wings , they charge you for a 12 pack and a 6 pack separately , which is more expensive than an 18 pack !
well-seasoned , perfectly cooked , and nice and fatty .
the food is reasonably price for the strip .
decent food/experience at a decent price .
really pricey for my fiance and i the bill was a little over $ 60 for the all you can eat . you only get 2 rounds of all you can eat .
the decor was miserable and gaudy .
i have only dined in this restaurant one time .
only , she did n't have the order ?
boozy and delicious , certainly not for a lightweight .
i have tried various items and truly love the tacos .
any coffee shop in a hip part of town with a line out the door , brews worthy coffee .
absolutely disgusted on how slow the service is .
when asking for a clean spoon , apologies were offered .
other than that mess , the food was good , beer was good and our waitress , who i 'm not so sure deserved the tip we gave her because she brought us dirty glasses two times in a row , was `` ok '' .
it 's classy but with sparkle ... if that makes sense hehe .
that was the only negative .
did not like soup , was more like tortellini 's in a very thick beef flavored gravy .
food is good , not great and is reasonably priced .
amazing happy hour and good drink prices .
the decor is a bit gaudy , but i 'm fairly certain that 's by design .
price is not too bad considering the location .
when you pay good money you wo n't get service and good food and unfortunately this particular popeyes has no idea how to do so .
good value . decent price .
price wise , i would say it is pretty expensive .
but worse than the food was the poor lighting in this new place . horrible florescent bulbs give the place the look of a morgue .
highly recommend dining here .
this review is for the restaraunt : cold fries , smelly fish tacos , and a cheeseburger that seemed mooshy and seemed to be composed primarily of soybeans or other fillers , not meat .
it took a very long time to be served and when we were it was 1 or 2 of us at a time .
i went there for dinner with friends couple weeks ago and i had a happy time here .
i did not have food but the happy hour sangria pitchers totally worth it !
plus , it was $ 5 wine wednesday , so i enjoyed a couple of glasses .
it was n't great . it was a glass of lime juice .
this was the best night out i 've had in a while . me and my girlfriend shared an app shared meals and each had a few drinks and their `` mystery shot '' ( which was a delicious strawberry margarita flavored shot for only a buck ) all this was under 60 bucks and jason ( our server ) had excellent recommendations , and was a great time .
no one was waiting to order , so i was able to step right up to the counter .
the king crab mac n cheese was prefect and loved the variety of breads .
i can think of many other jobs that are worse than toasting bagels , i can buy great bagels from bialy 's around the corner and toast them at home ... during this visit also noticed dirty tables that no staff seemed to be interested in cleaning .
it is almost impossible to spend under $ 10 for lunch there .
for eating on the strip , it 's reasonably priced .
everything is seasoned perfectly and has the right consistency the hot sauce is actually spicy which is great ! the rice is so tasteful and this is honestly the best burrito in the city !
not too shabby the food and service are pretty good and prices are decent .
they had a all you can eat special ( 15-17 $ per person i think ) .
i told the waitress that there was hair and she said oh lol was expecting that there were going to replace it or not charge us for it , but they did .
the atmosphere is very cozy with a few tables but the food is excellent .
dark awkward feeling in there .
also we tried to order dos equis on draft but there was something wrong with the tap that made it taste like a completely different beer .
i wish i was better at this whole dressing thing , but it is clearly not a strong point of mine .
to start we had coffee and tea ( great selection of hot teas ) and a homemade triple berry muffin with blueberry , raspberry , and blackberry .
i mean , for vegas , that 's pretty darn cheap .
draft beer was not as cold as it should be , order bottles . crappy music .
good beer selection with the opportunity to order pitchers rather than just pints .
the prices are reasonable as well .
and every time i call ahead to make reservations it seems they are not taking reservations and the person who answers the phone is always rude .
the price is right too .
the rice was perfect to our liking , not too mushy or too dry .
i like that the price are reasonable and affordable .
most sandwiches range from $ 5-6 , which is n't bad for a foot long .
i 'll grab breakfast here again for sure but not if i 'm in hurry .
i seriously recommend to go here than wasting your money in a casino .
it was replaced with another draft beer that was n't that great either .
the borsch was decent and served hot .
food is fabulous , done to perfection , properly seasoned , flavorful , and the presentation was exquisite .
i ca n't remember the name but we got a shot of this amazing infused liquor they create in house .
go when the weather is nice .
ehh not as good as it was a year ago . my benedict was cold and the eggs were basically hard boiled .
still it was hard to make up or the cost of the calamari and cheesecake .
they only had sapporo on tap . there is a pretty nice selection of bottled beers but they 're terribly overpriced for a bottle .
the waiter said `` well , if it was n't for those people over there ( us ) it would n't be so cold . ''
they also are extremely flavorful .
small place but friendly - very good drink specials and prices .
you will love this place .
the prices are very cheap , but the quality is great !
they have a small menu , but everything is delicious .
first time at this location and food was great !
the walls are brightly colored , which i enjoyed a lot , but along one side was a series of illustrations depicting ... a person ?
best yet , they had unique flavors available .
the vibe in crave is awesome - upscale without being stuck up and relaxed without being the usual bar scene .
waiting in the cold is better than waiting around for them to get their acts together and decide to seat us .
killer arugula salad , pizzas and flatbreads were great .
charged full price for a drink that was supposed to be special- waitress gave wrong day menu . only gave half credit for bad chicken .
when we arrived , the host could not give me an estimate for wait times as we did n't have a reservation . we were however , promptly seated at a dirty table which we had to request be cleaned .
i would be inclined to try them out again , but the taste of the fish was disappointing .
the prices are very reasonable .
while i have a sweet tooth for breakfast , they have great omelets , thick cut bacon , and sandwiches to satisfy a diverse palate .
very reasonably priced as well .
lv slater 's 50/50 had great vibes , great staff members , and overall a great dining experience for my husband and me .
i like how cozy and cute it is .
troy always lets us sample the beers before we order full glasses if they are on tap .
sad too , i spent almost $ 14 dollars on it .
the bathroom was nice and big , but the lighting could be better , it was kind of dark .
nice prices for vegas too .
the dish itself had maybe 6 pieces of chicken , and the rest of it was all vegetables .
good little spot with great food at a fair price .
it 's delicious . filled with really flavorful tender wontons that hold up great in the piping hot delicious broth .
for the appetizer we ordered the roasted mushroom pate , which was delicious , but the portions were very small for three people so we all wished that we had ordered another starter to share .
the nasi goreng was not authentic . poorly spiced and the chicken tasted like rubber .
it 's unbelievably fruity and refreshing .
small place , but nice atmosphere .
the owner is super friendly and the service was great .
i get that the price point is low and they are trying to provide a higher end experience for a very reasonable price .
the price is good as well .
awesome vibe , fair prices , and just high quality food .
the pictures of the restaurant , do n't do justice - it looks and feels much more elegant in person .
my club sandwich was not 3 layers of bread like a normal club , but it was still ok. just not what i expected .
crunchy spicy tuna was interesting . crunchy sweet shell stuffed with rice and topped with tuna .
the lighting was bad , very dark inside which felt weird while having breakfast .
the fries hardly have any salt on it at all , which i love .
the quality is very good and the price is reasonable .
the asparagus i thought was some of the worst i 've ever had - overcooked and just a bad , burnt , taste .
if u go downstairs to the washrooms the lighting is great to take some pics
i had the plum sake and though it was delicious i feel there was actually very little alcohol in it .
i also recommend their drinks ! they have lychee , mango , and melon lemonades , and i ca n't decide which is my favorite .
beer selection was weak as well , and their bottle menu was inaccurate .
beer selection through the roof . not a full bar though , just beer and wine .
the waiters are great , but the hostesses are so rude and disrespectful !
staff was very friendly !
there were no labels on the food and every time we asked the staff they were very annoyed .
food and drinks are mediocre for a hefty price tag .
ages ago , all the dishes were probably below $ 4 but with inflation and what not , it 's ridiculous now .
places like this pisses me off , we are supporting the business and instead of giving us the fundamentals of decent customer service , they treat you worse .
i usually spend $ 10 at taco bell and do n't like myself after , now i spend under $ 8 here and it 's delicious .
we also enjoyed 2 glasses each of beer , headhunter for hubby and bumbleberry for me . we both thought the drinks were delicious , and loved that we were able to grab a cold 4 pack for the road .
where do i begin , the order being 30 minutes late or the owner/manager being indifferent and not to mention spilling of food on us . stick to the cooking , if they do any .
and not sure why all the clutter in the hallway towards the bathroom .
cheap ok wines by the glass .
gears and chains and an `` indian motorcycles '' light up florescent sign that kind of is n't that attractive .
alright . i mean , it was less expensive than say , bad daddy 's , but it also tasted that way .
prices are reasonable for the quality of food .
but , it makes everything taste great !
and the frozen margarita did n't seem to have hardly any tequila .
prices are great for the area .
i had a couple of their special hh cocktails , which packed a good punch .
probably not as cheap as your favorite college chinese spot , but it 's certainly a good quality for the price ! '
all were great . they also did n't skimp on the alcohol in the cocktails .
unfortunately , the saving grace from all of that food was the wonton soup .
it was delicious and a decent price .
a very good secret find close to home .
people also complain that the décor is outdated . i do n't know about that , but i liked the décor a lot .
the `` og '' margarita was n't bad in flavor , but did n't have any indication that any tequila was in it .
try the tasters group , so you can try out many beers . they always have a wine for happy hour too .
the atmosphere is small and cozy and has a lot of the decorations that are to be expected at a chinese restaurant , buddha bellies everywhere and a pretty little pond with flowers and foliage surrounding it .
this place definitely surprised me .
unfortunately , i am not a craft beer drinker , but they did had a very large beer selection .
that was minor though , the food is what really disappointed me . the food presentation was good , however when i got it home ... i noticed the rice was different from what i am used too and it had no flavor .
i started with the sangria - which was unique and delicious .
surly service , not great coffee , and bad music .
by far the best meal we had during our three day trip to montreal .
6 beers on tap and only one watered down version if a beer , so that 's a plus .
minor cons - bathroom is pretty ghetto looking . it just needs more lighting and a working sensor on the paper towels .
the prices are reasonable .
excited about this new place !
i felt that the place was a shithole disguised with nice decor .
worst service . my server was steph v. , and she was too busy talking to her co-workers than taking care of her only customer in her section on a sunday afternoon for lunch .
awesome ! our server sean was fantastic and i 'm pretty picky about service .
the service was fast & friendly .
i enjoyed the crab and lobster ravioli in a cream sauce and my date had lasagna with meat sauce . both were delicious .
great food and reasonable prices . be careful about sitting outside , it 's a busy intersection with some loud noise and the tables do n't afford much leg room !
the service was very slow and the server did n't know the difference between a draft and bottled beer .
martini was to my liking . well done a happy customer .
the atmosphere is n't bad with the dim lighting and all , but i could do without all the arizona nature porn on the wall .
it comes with raita like at most places , and the raita is great as well !
the bathroom walls sadly need a fresh coat of bright paint - the restaurant decor is fine but when you walk into the women 's washroom , you feel like you 've entered into some other grimy business .
very authentic . the prices are pretty average .
the decor is absolutely beautiful , kind of like your standard diner but elevated with some whimsical and eclectic touches like the gold frosted mirrors and bw illustrations .
4 ) the atmosphere is nice due to the large windows allowing you to people watch on state street ( unfortunately , that wo n't make the sushi taste better ) .
beer selection was large however , so i 'm sure beer drinkers enjoy that . i do not really drink beer though .
our waitress , jess , was super efficient , friendly and top-notch .
the atmosphere inside was so cute , it did n't feel like it should be in the burbs ! great spot all around , only missing one star because it was really loud inside .
my husband ordered the goat stew . the meat was super tender , juicy , and fell right off the bone .
they are always super friendly and easy to get in and out for lunch pretty quickly !
they said they were out of 2 queens and only had a king to offer . i actually paid more to book 2 queen , but their response was that read the fine print ; they hold the right to change rooms .
try the beef kabobs . they are made in the traditional manner and are delicious .
only 23 dollars for two shawarma and two drinks . money for jam .
it looked like the decorator thought they were designing a buffet . it could be very sexy and dark with the egyptian theme , but they failed .
not sure if it was called for in this iteration of the dish but either way it did n't taste like it was in there .
sometimes a bit slow because of how busy they are . baffles me that they only have 1 server on sometimes .
high ceilings and indoor plants always a plus . patio and open windows , even better , especially if you hate air con like i do !
there 's a bar and patio street side for people watching and a darker , more cozy dining area inside .
the price is good .
we came into an empty restaurant to a confused hostess who did not know where to seat us .
they charge a small fortune for each steak so the price the value is a very poor ratio .
had to request a plate which was n't clean and was soaking wet .
i think this is a great spot with nice and fresh food . the servers are always pleasant .
great drinks , awesome service , and killer snacks .
yes , there is free house wine , but that is not free when you have to pay $ 25 for a plate of spaghetti .
beer selection good but server had no clue .
i came here with my mom before the bocelli concert and we sat at the corner table with a beautiful view of the strip .
the place has a beautiful patio for enjoying our wonderful az weather as well as plenty of seating inside .
terrible . both me and my son got sick after eating here .
the decor put me off when i first visited -- -it 's kind of ugly and cliched -- -but the lighting makes up for it and creates a cozy ambiance .
not sure if $ 36 would be worth it though but we were happy with our half priced buffet .
i should have gone with wine since bad wine is better than pbr , coors light , or the m pilsner style ( not real pilsner ) beer that the server knew nothing about .
i 'm not sure whether it was the tomato or the salmon , but it tasted as if one of them had recently come out of the freezer ( or at a minimum an extremely cold fridge ) . this really ruined the whole meal .
i highly recommend to all friends and family .
this location is extremely family friendly , as i brought my girlfriend and her kids to eat there .
no tap beer , no blended drinks for a decent margaritas and out of steak for tacos .
weird lighting , weird colors and no meat to be found .
go here only if you want to pay $ 35+ a head for basically golden corral level food .
we had the classic pork and chive dumplings as well as the pork buns for appetizers , and they were both amazing !
nice location with the decor to match the restaurant menu and theme , and overall comfortable environment . nice staff .
great option for the neighborhood that is n't super expensive . the prices are n't cheap , but you definitely get a good portion for your buck .
they have lunch specials that are quite cheap in price too .
the syrup is n't the runny , watery kind either .
it smells horrible , your shoes stick to the ground , there 's broken glass everywhere that they do n't clean up , it 's wall to wall people : so basically a huge fire hazard .
we had a bottle of champagne to celebrate the end of our trip , and it was fantastic ( and very well priced ) .
still a great spot to grab a bite to eat .
this definitely satisfied my craving .
rude waitress , got the orders wrong 3x and then told me that if i didnt like how she was serving i should go across the street to the venue ... welp i did .
i ordered and enjoyed just one rum and coke .
plus , the food prices are very reasonable for the strip .
horrible lighting ( lack of lighting ) very awkward toilets and placement of shall .
ambiance and decor make the experience unique and memorable .
total for our order was around $ 24 - great prices !
waiter was friendly , but it took about 20 minutes for drinks from the bar and even longer for food . if not for that the atmosphere and food was awesome !
do n't be afraid to spend on yourself . you wo n't be disappointed .
the people are lovely and the treats are beautiful .
no lemongrass chicken ? well there was a stir fry but that was kinda oily .
this is not the place for an intimate dinner .
however , i was satisfied with my beer choice ( pumking ) and my friend loved her cocktail ( the pear and ginger one ) .
we got the plain , curry and loaded chicken salad and were beyond pleased with all of the options !
couple of blackjack dealers were pretty arrogant and did n't even know basic strategy for the game they dealt .
when i placed my order , i gave him a twenty as he said the total was twenty .
bartenders were attentive , pleasant and got our orders right . we with certainly be back !
we walked up the stairs and looked in to the restaurant , no one was in there , no staff , no customers , no sign posted , only what the hours and days of operation were that indicated that the restaurant should be open .
the decor does n't completely mesh , but somehow it 's still cozy .
i think it 's moderately prices although it was $ 2.75 per topping added .
this little restaurant/bar , inside terminal 4 of sky harbor , smells amazing and the food looks good .
the decor here makes it a pretty cute spot but that 's about the extent of what i enjoyed about this place .
this spot was cool . i loveeee the ambiance and the interior .
the atmosphere is also good . the prices are way high .
pretty average prices , but good food and environment !
great happy hour ( including both drinks and appetizers ) .
the place is consistent . no surprises , just cheap prices , acceptable quality , and usually pretty quick .
although i do n't drink beer , i was impressed by their incredible selection of beer on tap .
i honestly do n't know why i expected more from this place , i loved the interior design and lighting but the food did not satisfy me at all .
our waitress gave us some awesome recommendations to the area since we were visiting , and was a delight to chat with .
seems like super basic , not authentic , boring even .
still , it is casual and nice .
not a bad bar .
no draft beer - but they have a good bottle selection .
the prices are great too .
nice ambiance ( although the frames without pictures creeped me out a bit .
the price was only $ 5 !
not sure what the issue was here .
the hostess was overwhelmed , put us on the list and said we only had to wait 7 minutes ( group of 3 ) another group of 4 came and waited 2 minutes before getting seated . our name was crossed off the list and the hostess did n't realize until after she 'd seated the other group that we were still waiting .
the rice was a bit dry and i wish i had a sauce to eat it with .
the chicken was supposed to be grilled . it might have been , but it was not grilled for me ... it had definitely been in the refrigerator .
good prices , great food .
the chicken was rather salty and on the dry side if it did n't have any skin attached . the saltiness of the chicken demanded a balance from the steamed rice , but the rice was not very good ; it was on the dry side either from over cooking or because it was a bit old .
we had seafood drunken noodles which was n't too bad .
and what 's with the fake graffiti in the bathroom ?
we also ordered the lunch special which i think was $ 13 or $ 14 each before tax .
i would say the price is moderate .
from appetizers to dessert , i could not say one bad thing about any of the dishes .
the bartender warned me that it was not a weak drink .
the sandwiches are very reasonably priced and decent .
despite the poor customer service , every time i come here , i like what i get .
i am more of a beer drinker than liquor drinker , and while there were only a few beers on tap , it was a good variety .
the drinks were tasty and they have good happy hour .
to say that this waitress was rude would be an understatement .
both are terrific , not as aggressively sweet and alcoholic as some sangrias can be , and the cinnamon in the red sangria made it perfect for an overcast january day .
the potatoes were kind of strange they had a stale after taste , my friend thinks it 's the cheese which may be too sharp !
the staff are awesome , it 's not often that in downtown montréal you 'll find staff who 'll greet you by name ! the fidelity card is great if you 're a regular .
even the margarita was bad .
yelp steers us to a great place and we will be back for sure !
well drinks are pretty weak , so i stick to beers .
there was a long wait , but the waitress was nice and even though they only had one pot of coffee for the whole restaurant she kept our cups filled .
throw in a soda and my entire meal was under $ 10 .
really happy with the selection of beer and the bar was beautiful with a window into the kitchen . later sat in the dining room- the decor was really rustic and chic at the same time with cool light fixtures and comfortable booths along the wall .
the only thing i did n't like was the rice .
you can be sure i will bless the doors of this place again sometime soon .
this is the only truly south indian restaurant i have been to in town .
no value for money here . this is a pricey wannabe high end cafe .
the drinks were pretty cheap ( wine , beer , margs ) but i do n't think they had any coors or bud on tap , which is unusual .
the prices are very high .
finally it was priced okay . i believe it was $ 10- $ 12 , which is n't bad for a craft cocktail , if i could tasty the alcohol .
there 's a story behind the counter that says why , but i got distracted and did n't read enough to know anything other than that there was a woman .
one of my favorite sushi restaurants in charlotte ! i have been going there for years and all the sushi rolls are fresh and delicious .
my favourite was the lobster bisque cappuccino ! but everything really was delicious !
expensive for the quality and service
my waitress not only took forever to come back to my table to take my order , she ended up giving me the wrong menu !
way too expensive and over-hyped .
the beef was also dry and tasted horrible .
the only exception seems to be the dq $ 6 meal deal .
the margarita was weak but ok and there is no way to screw up a cold corona !
nice , dim lighting . decor a little heavy on the taxidermy , but the decorator kept to her concept and constructed a coherent atmosphere .
my only gripe is 3 out of 4 times , the same pizza cost me $ 13.50 and one time it cost $ 17.50 .
you get a nice view of the fountain .
for the price you pay for a slice it 's amazing .
food is decent . drinks are reasonably priced .
i ordered the kendrick sandwich and a hefeweizen both of which were surprisingly good . the sandwich sounded good on the menu and delivered once eaten .
the prices were certainly higher than your average dog and fries , but you absolutely get more than you pay for .
still not cheap but very reasonable .
they had decent collection of wine but we went for a cocktail which was nice and refreshing .
their lunch specials are good value too , huge portions for under 9 bucks .
they have amazing drink selection too .
the chicken rolls are killer . everything is good here .
so basically , it was good and the pricing is reasonable .
i asked for a hefeweizen but no ; they have 30 beers on tap including 6 different ipas , but not a hefeweizen in the house .
for $ 25 per person for ayce , this place is amazing .
price was reasonable for the shot - $ 5 total bill for two with one liter of beer ( i did n't drink ) and two meals with tip $ 80
it was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious . my wife had the chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado .
in addition , their sparkling soda is so refreshing .
the food actually is n't bad , but heavy on the grease .
not a fan of the color scheme or the lighting -- it just does n't give me that warm , fuzzy feeling i like in a neighborhood joint .
all the waitresses were attentive and very friendly .
was looking forward to a good burger place in lv , guess i 'll keep on looking .
we had : model t , a refreshing gin and cucumber based ) and jump the shark in a shark glass .
the patio was busy , the inside of the restaurant was pretty dead .
the price is super affordable , too .
pricing is a bit high but not unreasonable .
i got the gyro lunch special .
my only remark is - for the price of two drinks and an appetizer for one person would be well over $ 40 for one person .
the wine selection was excellent and well-priced .
it 's served with cranberry walnut toasted bread , and that sweet flavor is surprisingly perfect with all three flavors of hummus .
i mean , i guess the decor makes it upscale ?
it was all superb . the best was the spicy chicken noodles and wontons .
this was my first time here and it was delicious !
we just went there for lunch & had delicious sashimi & salmon rolls !
bud light and miller lite were not on tap , and i 'm certain that the bartender would tell anyone that ordered one to either drink a real beer or get the hell out .
a friend & i had a lovely lunch here .
for $ 4-5 per taco you 'd think it would at least be 2oz . you 'd be wrong .
it was decent , but not incredible . the mongolian beef was very good , the dumplings and fried rice were okay , and the orange chicken was just meh ( did n't even taste `` orangey '' at all ) .
i would n't hate myself for paying $ 16 for mediocre chicken ) .
it 's a bit on the dry side and lacks in flavour .
what 's more , when i visited the store , the girl working at the counter was rude and patronizing .
not a bad bar .
unfortunately , no bud light lime on tap so we just drank regular beer .
yes , you 're eating in a strip mall , so it is n't very fancy and you 'll look pretty cruddy under the fluorescent lights ... but who cares ?
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
the only beer they had was budweiser .
this place was amazing .
the staff was nice but the food was bad . the meat was dry and tasteless .
beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor . or at least the menu was .
very small place so only a small bar inside and few tables outside but still nice to sit and eat if not too busy and weather is nice .
the prices were normal .
happy is so good , we will be back soon .
and they have some good beers for the pitcher not .
great food and very reasonable prices .
nice that they have restrooms but the women 's bathroom was dirty , out of toliet paper and soap .
i recommend trying this place out during happy hour when no music is playing to enjoy their food .
decor was weird and oddly spacious ... in a way that indicated they did n't have enough money for more booths .
the owner is wonderful and genuinely caring .
all three of them were very rude .
the bun looked identical to the ones at walmart that you got eight for a dollar , sad part is that it tasted worse than those .
i really liked the ambiance even the darkness because the table lighting was adequate to read the menu .
the furniture here was outdated and not to fit the theme , but just nothing aesthetically pleasing .
i paid $ 11.50 for an amazing salad . yes , charging $ 1.50 for 1/4 avocado is cray .
bad idea ! margaritas were ok but not booze in them !
honestly , by the time i finished my salad i could n't really taste a whole lot because it was just so sweet .
what a great place to have a glass of wine .
our server was super friendly and recommended an awesome grapefruit beer , stiegl .
needless to say , a pretty pathetic and frustrating response .
but wow , portions were great , prices reasonable ( under $ 16 ) , but more importantly , the food was delicious !
if the weather is nice , you can dine on the patio . i highly recommend eating here .
the marble ( i think ? ) steps and the black on the curtains and walls made the restaurant look that much more sophisticated .
i had the veal parmagiana sandwich ( around $ 8 or $ 9 , plus $ 1.50 for a side of fries ) , and a both of my other dining compatriots ordered the 9 '' chicken club pizza ( somewhere around $ 12 before tax ) .
it totally did n't go with the deco or theme .
we went to babbo 's late on a friday .
tried a flight of house ipa 's , all good , and a mixed veggie and polenta hot pot that was fresh and spicy .
this was a great explosion of flavors that just worked .
food good , but does not justify the costs ... too expensive .
the walls in the rooms seemed paper thin , the room itself felt dark and uninviting , and the resort itself is just so massive and lacking a flow pattern that it feels stale .
clean , and staff were very attentive .
hard to say anything bad about this place .
the consistency was just right however , not too sweet and heavy .
complete boring place with no atmosphere or personality absolutely no pictures on any walls . boring !
the prices are good and when the food is good , it is decent .
not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses , that were more like scotch glasses , only knock .
just good plain ingredients served extraordinarily well !
they are not very good at placing your order or filling your water not because they are rude , they just do n't know what they are doing .
do n't bother . the three draft beers our group tried were tasteless , even after we specified we prefer hoppy brews .
huge portions , great flavor and not stupid expensive : $ 23 with tip and tax .
after the manager overheard her she looked & said caitlyn the reservation is right here and i 'll seat them right away .
we love this place . the food is very good and the staff is friendly .
i even think their salads are great .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
the staff were also friendly especially our server who was very attentive to us .
i will say that the food is nothing special per se .
it defintely needed either seasonings or more cheese , so it was quite a disappointment , but the chicken and waffles made up where it lacked .
the fountain is pretty cool but the shop could use more space for seating .
i hope things turn around as patio is amazing ! could be a great place .
the seafood linguini was great . there were generous amounts of shrimp , scallops , and lobster .
ordinarily , i think it 's rather pricey , so happy hour wednesdays are good for the budget .
i called and they were rude on the phone , i went in they were rude in person .
a couple yrs ago i ordered a chicken parmigiana & all i got was 3 pieces of chicken . no , pasta ... i was like wtf
they have a great happy hour for drink and food specials .
drinks were fine and they had a good selection of beers on tap .
great beers , bartenders do n't know anything about the beers . the menu is ok. not bad to pair beer with .
but $ 13 . for a side salad seems excessive considering the menu .
the decor was nice , but is that paint color blush of bashful ?
wonderful combinations , all the tacos were stunning .
the one thing i thought a little unusual was that they served beer , had a couple of taps and some bottled craft beers listed on a chalkboard .
the atmosphere is really nice and it looks fancy and expensive but it 's actually reasonably priced .
nonetheless it can be fairly affordable -- we paid around $ 120 for a dinner for two after tax and tip .
food was average . price was outrageous .
also , a random unnecessary thing to note : the girls washroom has a very fancy sink , the guys do not .
great place ! especially before a long night ( edc ) great sangria , awesome food
cold tilapia is not good . charging 25 cents for a small plastic cup for water is tacky .
( note : for being such a upscale and nice hotel with a `` reputation '' you would think their employees uniforms would be more elegant and classy than the pepto bismol skirt suit the hostesses wear .
i found the decor slick and appealing , has kind of a velvet rope appeal without being too clubby feeling .
the servers are all over the place handing out wrong orders to different tables .
both were good , although the rice bowl should have been listed under appetizers rather than entrees .
i am not sure if it was the crazy amount of cabbage that caused the taste but pretty gross .
burnt end tastes so good .
the drink menu is really good as well . they have regular margaritas , unique margaritas and seasonal cocktails .
good drinks ( the free house margarita with a yelp check in is actually pretty good , and strong ) , good food , and good atmosphere !
stopped by for a quick late dinner while in town .
when my wife was served undercooked chicken , the manager tried `` educating '' us about cooking chicken .
employees strike me as a little creepy , but hey it 's vegas .
the walls in the rooms seemed paper thin , the room itself felt dark and uninviting , and the resort itself is just so massive and lacking a flow pattern that it feels stale .
pizza is so delicious .
poor , poor customer service .
prices are really good for the quality of food .
the wine list is fairly lengthy and they feature a full bar with craft cocktails too .
the food itself is very delicious , i love the salad with the bell peppers and feta ; too delicious !
i had a delicious hot chocolate and enjoyed the assortment of board , card and dice games in a cozy atmosphere . the `` free play '' winter special is a plus , and i hope that it continues with the purchase of a drink from their extensive coffee menu .
this restaurant was nice i loved the neutral color scheme and low lighting .
the rice is not so great . it does n't have much flavor and pretty dry for my taste .
i was introduced to this place by my fiance as a late night food place for us to hit up after a night out .
this place is super cool and hip . i love the patio and the food and service was good .
only complain i have is that the lighting is really weird .
the server was friendly but in the beginning was very attentive .
good , clean food . fair prices .
people should feel valued when they spend money with any company considering how hard we work to make a living these days .
when we finally settle my initial order , i asked about the different fries options but he did n't seem to know what they were .
the staff great you warmly when you arrive and the energy continues through the meal . everything on the menu is excellent .
the margarita was weak but ok and there is no way to screw up a cold corona !
we ordered our meals and the server was very attentive from the beginning but as soon as we received our food she did not come by regularly to clean up the empty plates and she did not ask if we wanted any additional drinks when are glasses became emptied .
the first trip there was great .
i had the gorditas and they were a bit bland but other than that , it was good food for a good price . the salsa was great but the chips were cold and a bit stale
the fish was okay , but not worth ordering again . the breaded shrimp was not deveined which made it look disgusting , and were still completely raw .
only bummer is that i did n't see any draft beer , only bottles .
unfortunately you pay hotel prices for a small portion .
do not know why they have such a crowd for breakfast but honestly toco bell would be a better choice ! i would n't even make my worst enemy eat there !
it 's really small with just the right amount of tables inside , which is nice because it 's impossible to get too crowded .
ok. the decor is all neon lights and straight out of the 80 's which was actually kind of endearing .
for $ 27 , that burger better have been great and it was .
and for what i notice lots of people were complaining about their food ending up getting cold .
my peach margarita was perfect for this hot night .
awesome fish tacos . everything is fresh and flavorful .
i do n't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible .
i was not impressed , at all.. especially for the $ 3.75 price tag .
menus one star cause the inside is kind of dark and dingy feel .
plus with yelp check-in , it 's $ 10 off $ 75 , which is not hard to do with most meals stating at $ 20 .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
if you like arnold palmers ( 1/2 and 1/2 ice tea and lemonade ) , they have a sun kissed ice tea which uses their tropical blend ice tea and lemonade -- easily my favorite part of the meal .
can get very loud inside so do n't come here looking for a quiet meal .
so my expectations are always pretty high when trying a new place .
yes actually , my two bartenders have been very pleasant to look at as well !
no draft beer , but a decent choice of cans and bottles .
the tortilla soup was awful . tasted burnt and had 1 cube of chicken .
1/2 off steaks ( and a gnocchi i just could n't pass up ) the vibe is straight up sexy , ( i never use that word because i feel awkward saying it out loud ) but its just dark , sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie .
great food that is reasonably priced .
for $ 50 per person i thought that was great .
it is very reasonably priced for what it is .
southside is a great place to people watch .
all 6 of them ... leaving me mostly without a sandwhich : ( service : las vegas is where my friends and i meet every year .
it 's irritatingly cheap .
tastes amazing and the menu has a lot of options . perfect for lunch !
my boyfriend and i tried casanova bros. the other night for dinner , and we were so impressed !
in the bar area is a pianist that plays intermittently throughout the day , which is was very nice but acoustically overwhelming at times .
i asked for a hefeweizen but no ; they have 30 beers on tap including 6 different ipas , but not a hefeweizen in the house .
no beer on tap , though , which is disappointing .
sound just bounces off the hard walls and makes it very difficult to have a conversation .
this place is great . we love there drunken noodles and chicken satay !
we only paid $ 100 dollars for everything but it was kinda pricey compared to other vietnamese restaurants .
they also have live music on the weekends and a jukebox if you want to pay for music you love .
for the price , this is a pretty good deal .
the price was reasonable .
it 's a cozy gem located on an otherwise crazy street .
it was more bland and the combination of food just seems a bit off ... could n't quite put our fingers on it .
good food , good prices .
prices are tough to beat .
we ordered bottled beers -- their beer selection is good , i will give them that .
my husband and friend 's boyfriend had beer ; the beer selection was pretty limited so if you do n't like negro modelo i would stick to a cocktail or wine .
love this place nostalgia ! great bbq and sides not cheap but not expensive either , fairly priced for the quality
i think the other rework the noodles with a different taste all together . other than that one menu item the place was pretty cool .
so now while i 'm enjoying this fantastic italian cuisine i also have a bad taste of gum in my mouth with my marinara sauce .
or maybe the cook was just legitimately overwhelmed , and one of the three servers meandering around could have stepped behind the burners to help him crank out some omelettes .
we order `` rat toes '' for an appetizer and i also ordered a watermelon alcoholic drink- which was huge .
oh and the price is pretty steep but hey , it 's local and tastes fantastic !
the outside seating area is beautiful and the bar and open kitchen area is perfect .
plus , they are offering a 15 % off grand opening special , call to check thou .
ordering feels a little awkward at first , due to its cafeteria-like style .
awesome pho dishes served with fresh herbs on the side . we tried the pho with beef and pho with shrimp- both arrived quickly , hot and delicious .
grilled salmon is my favorite !
attentive , fast , and courteous .
pretty frustrating for the delay !
he recommended a great bottle of on the road grenache .
everyone is super nice .
however the beer was cold , and they had smithwick 's on tap .
they are mouthwatering and only about $ 2 each !
feels like a new place with the awkward paper table coverings .
food is well priced and very tasty , drinks are expensive , backyard is pretty .
i was just trying to help avoid other bad reviews from people .
for drinks i tried the vodka with kool aid , very strong but good .
the atmosphere is pretty cool .
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
2.5 stars this place is cute , fun decorations , small & quaint .
the prices are not insignificant but not stupid .
the lasagna was so cold inside it still had pieces of shredded cheese that had not melted inside of chewy lasagna noodles .
the shrimp skewer was cold and flavourless , the pasta sauce was clumpy and too thick with a weird taste , and the fried shrimp was plain .
the location is perfect in conjunction to where i live .
fantastic wine list as well .
a great place to start the morning if you 're looking for an affordable breakfast that fills you up .
the decor is a bit weird for the ambiance of the restaurant , i guess its a talking piece .
good thing it is at a bar and i could get an ice cold draft beer .
i went to this place while in town for a convention and was pleasantly surprised at how great it was . i ended going there again my last night in town .
only compliment while staying here was a lousy valet attendant who was rude . other than that the trump was great .
not even sure it was fish .
i 've never heard any atmospheric music being played , the carpet is ugly , the furniture is boring and dark , and there is no privacy offered by the interior design .
the lunch special is phenomenally priced .
the main draw , i believe , is the great prices offered because tax is included in the price listed .
the price is a little high , but you get a lot of nachos for what you pay for .
the food was very delicious ! i had the lamb chops and my girlfriend had the chicken breast .
service was fine for me ... but i did just get there after opening and was the only person there when i sat down .
weird way of ordering .
still good for brunch , but that 's where my recommendation stops .
when we tried to order drinks , the were out of the only draft beer , negro modelo ... and 3-4 of the bottle beers , and my 1st tequila choice ... then the bartender actually told me the hefeweizen bottle beer was `` just '' like the 2x ipa they were out of ... .really ?
not sure why there are poor reviews here - this is a fine place to eat .
we had a great bottle of cabernet , which was a perfect recommendation from our waiter . we started with a plate of local cheeses , which were all amazing .
when you add in all of the tattoos , nose rings , ear discs and other face jewelry it just gives a trashy look to an otherwise beautiful restaurant .
price is decent too .
the chicken was bland and could have used some seasoning . the rice also lacked any kick .
my hand tossed veggie pizza was fresh , hot and delicious .
i decided to try their melona popsicle dipped in sprite and spiked with soju ... served up in a glass jar with a straw , cute .
run-down hotel , room is dirty ( there is a booger on the tissue box cover in the bathroom ) .
not only did he add the night , it was cheaper than what i was quoted on the phone and he waived my resort fee .
the coating on the tiny pepper fell off and somehow it looked like my plate got flooded with pepper juice or an unknown liquid , possibly from the watery beans ( see pics ) .
it just did n't taste all that great .
our appetizer ( goat cheese portabella ) , salad , and bread with the hummus dip were all great .
the staff are smart and attentive , very helpful . the food is excellent !
the beer selection was n't bad .
great wine and draft list and they make a top notch sazerac .
i 've been to toast in dilworth a dozen times for breakfast and am always impressed . the place is always busy , but the service is speedy .
i thought at first , the lady behind the counter was joking when she said no to my request for an empty plastic cup , but no , she was completely seriously . she looked at me like i was crazy and said she has empty cups , but she did not just hand them out .
cheap ok wines by the glass .
the brisket what super tender and juicy . pork was perfect and the ribs were amazing .
i then told her there is two for breakfast , she then said it will be 25 to 30mins and you can then only order lunch not breakfast .
we loved their aguas frescas - mine was strawberry muddled with mint and his was blueberry and orange - it was totally refreshing .
some of my best college memories include sitting on the terrace , just chilling with friends and drinking beer while doing some people watching .
highly recommend to all foodies ( & drinkers ) .
lots of choices on the menu . great music and dining area .
the wine and the wine steward were well paired ; we enjoyed our interactions with him .
the ambience was just outright creepy .
i did however notice different beer selection in the bottle .
very good , and very reasonably priced .
not bad , but they could definitely add some taps or bring in some bottled beer .
i also got a mango mojito which was not bad .
great casual friday night dinner with hubbie . sheena gave us great service .
oh , and very reasonably priced .
great bread basket . i love carbs and a good bread basket and this one had a great assortment .
my only real issue with the restaurant was that we were essentially kicked out at 9. we had n't been told upon booking ( or even when we were seated ) that they had a time limit on saturday nights .
some very expensive but plenty the average person can afford to shop at .
the booths are cozy and give a casual feeling to the atmosphere .
here 's the breakdown : the bathrooms were filthy and had no paper towel .
our waiter was extremely nice and accommodating .
it 's a great , inexpensive hot lunch for around $ 5 . ca n't beat it .
really good food at a reasonable price .
especially after you 've had a few drinks consumed .
i only go there when i have $ 50 to spend in one sitting .
sides are between 5 and 8 bucks and the signature bone in steaks between 42 and 49 so all considered this place is about as reasonable as a steak house gets nowadays .
kinda outdated ... but that adds to the appeal .
i highly recommend this place .
beer selection was good , but a gastropub should have unique vessels for drinks . cider in a guinness pint glass is just ... .wrong .
the interior does not get proper design and some furniture get placed in some awkward places .
the food is always very satisfyingly delicious , every dish is sooo good .
reasonable prices and good service .
the food is great and the prices are moderate .
i 'm having a nice rum on the rocks .
sea salt fries were burnt , chocolate cake was super dry , and my filet was pretty mediocre .
amber jacks was great bc of the food and staff .
food is pretty good - prices are a little high .
two : they are reasonably priced for a strip restaurant .
i had the prime rib which was really good and tender .
after 20mins . we finally get to place our order .
it 's also weird how the chili oil was n't spicy nor hot either ?
because we were part of a tour , the owner brought out a bunch of free ginger beer & dark rum cocktails ( yum ! )
the menu is simple and the prices are decent .
yes , they are very , very expensive but that 's the price you pay for a 5 star restaurant .
the mirror was a bit dirty .
pretty sad to be honest . will not return .
it was very loud as well . great lighting , though .
the decor was modern and clean as well as nicely spaced affording guess to enjoy their visit .
lighting and decor is kind of trashy ... but i did like the meal .
flavor was so-so , nothing special about it .
the price of the meal was fine but the actually food was mediocre at best . i had the taquitos , the portion size was decent but flavor was lacking .
crazy . for $ 40 , anyone can do it .
and the ingredients are really , really cheap .
it was very good and fresh .
the drinks are terrific .
the curry was also very tasteless and oily .
the garlic shrimp was delicious beyond description .
there was barely any chicken . only 3 small pieces of vegetables , just a lot of sauce .
i was satisfied with the jug of wine .
in an alley , off a side street is this wonderful restaurant .
normally i would gladly accept server feedback and this is purely my own opinion but i just had the suspicion that he was intentionally trying to deter me from ordering the wine for reasons other than what was stated .
it 's so flavorful . it 's spicy and sweet - addicting !
the first reaction was to vomit nauseous food and very expensive 80 $ dollars for my dog and i had to throw it in the trash can .
service was great , interior was very dark .
everything was perfect with exceptions below .
really enjoyed the ambiance .
awesome happy hour first of all .
this little spot is fantastic !
additionally our meals ( pasta ) came out cold . it was so unpleasant that some of my companions sent their meals back .
i 'm glad a great taco spot opened up on this side of town .
finally a waitress came from the kitchen area and asked if i had been helped .
some people say it 's a bit pricey for the quality and that might be a bit true as sashimi prices are slightly higher on average .
conclusion : eat at uc chipotle only if you 're desperate , but be prepared for an agonizing wait by apathetic , lethargic employees .
its 3 meals at $ 10 a piece so not too bad for las vegas .
still has a good vibe , good menu & martini list .
i also love barriques because they have a great selection of wine and alcohol and every so often they will do a wine tasting event .
the food was great , the server was polite and knowledgeable , and they had someone playing live music on the beautiful patio .
it 's very trendy yet moderately upscale . the restaurant is beautiful .
i only had beer .
obviously , it is priced a little higher than other steak houses , so if paying a lot of money for a good steak is n't your thing , outback is a great option .
and this might sound weird but the lighting was perfect .
they have wonderful fried mushrooms and zucchini . fry 's are nice and thick and their burgers are thin but wide .
the beer i got ( which was the cheapest on tap besides miller lite ) was not bad .
it was oddly sweet .
but there 's not a whole lot of substance to hold up all that pretentious vibe .
i could eat the chicken soup everyday !
not impressed and not worth the price ( $ 100 for two )
the wings we ordered were also cold and the cannoli just sadly drenched with hershey 's syrup and kisses on top .
this place is awful i do n't know why the ratings are so high .
price tag is pretty good considering the amount and quality of the food you get .
there was only my table and another table .
friendly service and a good bargain .
the decor was `` soothing '' -- which some people might find bland , i suppose .
casual and prices are fair .
but i do n't want to pay $ 600 a night , and i 've been mostly happy with paris .
well to start off the waitress looked like she had a cold and was very rude probably because she did n't want to work that day .
to be fair all we had was a bama breeze and a mango margarita .
it was really refreshing .
the place has a reputation for being pricey . in any case , the reason for the poor rating is the service .
overall a entertaining evening with great food for a moderately expensive $ 70 with tax and tip .
what a great meal ! i had the crispy duck curry and it was a treat .
gets kind of loud , it is a sports bar type of place actually a microbrewery .
first of all they can charge the prices they do if its justified with the full spectrum experience and it was not .
my food arrived like it was slopped on a plate from a giant ladle , it had no seasoning , there were fingerprints all across the dish and the service seemed to ignore half of my section .
first of all i will say that the service was amazing . everyone was very friendly and was attentive to our needs .
the portion was good for 2 people , it was $ 30 which was decently priced imo .
on a different note , the men 's bathroom was very messy and there was no soap or paper towels anywhere .
i am normally a vodka drinker , but the bartender told us we had to try their sangria .
you ca n't beat the prices for high end food and cocktails .
their goat cheese melted in your mouth , the shrimp was delicious , the potatoes were perfectly cooked and their beef was so juicy .
i brought in a `` buy one , get one donut free '' coupon and they refused to honor it because `` they had a different owner '' or something to that end .
$ 10 and a very small serving .
it was good not all that though .
this place made an effort but half empty restaurant ca n't handle party of 12 guest on a saturday it took 45 min to take our order really sad . 1 hour later finally got appetizers and 2 hours in waiting on food .
they 're fast , friendly , and reasonably priced .
the whole thing just feels ... dirty .
the combination of ingredients was great , but best of all , was the dough . their dough blows everything i 've tried lately out of the water .
it was good , ca n't beat a $ 5.55 meal .
i do think 1.90 a taco is a little pricey , it 's not outrageous , and we are willing to pay .
the cocktails were delicious and you ca n't go wrong with happy hour !
they have very attentive service which is a huge plus and also ... i mean , it 's hot pot ! yum !
there is so much attention to details that the interior design is 5 stars on its own .
the alcohol menu is a little small but $ 2.00 beers is also a steal to go with the cheap menu prices .
the goulash was very good and the schnitzel was fried to perfection !
odd location , next to no frills . looks like it would suck , ugly sign , boring inside .
the meal was delightful . the wine selection was superb .
they have indoor or outdoor seating and the atmosphere is very relaxing and nice .
needless to say i was looking to spend at least $ 50 .
the dining area is nice and spacious .
would 've liked to see some drafts but nonetheless , the bottled beer selection was great .
a great neighborhood find !
it was expensive at $ 35 per day but i got a $ 10 discount since i was there at a conference .
it 's hard to find a serene space smack dab in the middle of the strip but alas !
sadly they did n't offer any hard cider , but a friend was happy with the beer on tap .
you do n't need to be able to see every inch of it , but it 's a little weird to have creepy bathroom mood lighting .
great food deals , but portions are small . very small .
it only cost about 8 bucks .
nice cozy atmosphere , good service .
wine bar great food and a nice selection of wines .
pretty dark , rugged , and maybe a little dirty ?
maybe it was the time on saturday afternoon but it was n't too loud so great for conversation .
the staff was friendly , the prices are cheap .
the prices are very reasonable .
the sopes were delicious . corn was interesting and loved the texture of the fresh , crunchy kernels .
i 've been dying to try pei wei , but there normally just is n't one close to me .
it 's a nice place to hangout , but the food and service is just okay , price was a little high , drinks were $ 8- $ 15 and food was $ 10- $ 15 per plate .
none of which was even remotely good .
maybe it 's purée in the sauce ? the flavor was good but my lips were too hot for me to enjoy it .
the selection was amazing and variety awesome .
has a really nice patio area to sit outside .
most of the food is pretty inexpensive .
if you are expecting high volume / medium quality - go elsewhere .
when i walked in the staff was very nice and pleasant .
let me list the ways : - tv low resolution and comes on at absurdly loud volume - confusing tv user interface - only one luggage stand - confusing directional sign when you get off elevator and are trying to find which long corridor to go down .
a definite stop for reasonably priced food .
we all know what tomatoes do when they get really warm : they get mushy and watery .
i stayed at luxor for 5 days pros nice environment , clean hotel , friendly staff , good services offered , love the fresh smell in the hotel area cons some of the tiles inside the restroom were scratched or almost like at dying stage .
i also got a cadillac margarita that tasted like they just lazily put the alcohol and margarita mix .
i believe i ordered a pepperoni and cheese pizza ( really good ) and a cheese steak with cap . i shared the pizza with friends .
we have been here twice and been delighted both times .
my cousin and i ordered the sake punch for two people which was very average and diluted .
unsanitary conditions are most visible in the butcher section ; old discolored cut meat and ground beef is visibly displayed , and dry blood is dripping all over over the meat display . and through it all the health department 's a grade is proudly displayed at n the top of the meat display case .
there was a green stain on one of the bathroom towels and everything was just dingy , stained and disgusting .
the draft list was n't bad but nothing out of the norm .
best shrimp wonton soup i 've ever had . their hot and sour soup is also amazing .
great wine selection by the glass and bottle and good tapas .
the prices were fair - not real cheap or expensive .
food was fair , but service was ... nah ... had this odd waitress who repeated my order wrong , i corrected her on the spot she gave me this annoyed `` i got this '' tone but still brought on the wrong order .
food was excellent and prices are reasonable .
chico does it right people , so go visit this place !
i love the food at this place !
had the kale & sausage soup , also delicious but a tad salty .
bill is about $ 45.00 not bad for this quality of of fish .
the service is friendly and knowledgeable . the food is awesome .
ca n't wait to return ! be sure to try the brunch on the week-ends as well !
service was n't bad either considering we were 8 people .
the girls had skinny margaritas that came in what looked like `` toy '' glasses and had hardly any tequila .
sadly they did n't offer any hard cider , but a friend was happy with the beer on tap .
i had to go find the manager and finally got my food and it had the smallest piece of chicken on it .
highly recommend the boozy slush on the drink menu which is dramatically prepared at your table .
i had my first mint julep , done to perfection here , as well as a specialty drink , the lucky ray , a mix of wine & peach schnapps , which i really enjoyed but would have liked in something other than a martini glass considering it was $ 11 .
i ordered the banana and my boyfriend ordered the cookies and cream . it was both delicious !
very bland food , basically a take out place . they have beers listed on the menu board but they were out of drafts , out of modelo , and the corona was n't cold !
also we tried to order dos equis on draft but there was something wrong with the tap that made it taste like a completely different beer .
when we were leaving we let them know how disappointed we were .
we did n't try any cocktails , but the beer selection was n't too bad .
fast & friendly staff eager to help or explain menu items & specials of the day .
the staff is always extremely friendly , and seem to really enjoy working there . the drive thru is always extremely fast .
i liked that it was not overly salty nor greasy .
gino was great ! super helpful and friendly ... even hooked us up with some cannoli donuts with candles for our anniversary !
i do n't enjoy going out for a nice dinner in the evening where i feel i am inconveniencing or bothering the staff and especially do n't appreciate being ignored and then spoken to in a rude manner with no regard for our time so unfortunately we wo n't be returning to this establishment .
the dinner was good for $ 15 .
i strongly recommend this as a date spot or just a place to take your family out of their comfort zone .
the decor is so fun and cozy , i 'm really excited to have more places like this in uptown .
prices were very reasonable .
i requested to have a high chair for my child and was never given it until i asked again .
strange , circular booths with plastic surrounding them in what seems like an attempt to be colorful , playful and modern but resulting in cheap and almost cheesy .
this has become one of my favorite places to eat .
the price is good also .
it is very small inside but really cute .
i am irritated because 1. there are n't that many people there , why is it taking that long to make an albacore handroll 2. quality customer service does n't exist anymore , they could have done something to compensate for their horrible service but did n't seem to care much !
it 's the perfect place for a girl 's night . my go-to drink is the blood orange bellini = so delicious !
pretty casual ambience , so it 's really better served for a light date , maybe not the best option if you 're looking for an intimate setting .
the rose sangria 's were delicious and went down easy .
this was a very unpleasant experience .
the views were literally straight outta a postcard -- we were on the 50th floor which came with a balcony and a breathtaking view of the strip and the bellagio water fountain .
it was priced reasonably for the quality and quantity .
the restaurant has an absurdly tacky interior . a shame , really .
what a great addition to the unlv proximity lunch spots .
the cost of drinks was high ( $ 4 for a bottle of dasani water ) .
the place has a nice ambience .
lunch prices are a great deal too .
the primrose was like a margarita style martini , it was n't too sweet and it was very , very strong . the blood orange martini was a sweeter choice .
pizza was n't very crisp . service was awesome , though !
service is always great too , we especially like one server who we tend to get a lot .
bumped review up for good food and polite attitude when i was able to reach them .
the bartender was friendly , but the sushi was bad . the rice was so sticky it was mushy , kinda like paste .
somewhat full bar not just beer and wine they do have liquor as well .
the beer keeps us coming back , namely the seasonal raspberry wheat ! a lovely refreshing beer for the summer .
the scone was terrible , dry and tasteless .
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
ambience : it was comfortable and everything felt sleek and clean .
the pork roll , however , was drenched in oil . the sweet chili sauce was good though .
just the way i like him i hate it when people act like they 're say to be in the sauce for someone else to thumbs up .
the staff is attentive .
i was so mad and felt so mistreated that i truly did n't want to eat there and i know i never will again .
creepy , i know ) .
when the server finally came to take our order , i placed our order and went to the bathroom only to be harassed by another fucking drug dealer .
reasonably priced ( especially for a steak place on the strip ) . the sides are good .
for a $ 200 dinner you 'd expect decent food .
i gave this one a three stars mostly because we ordered a pitcher or margarita and honestly i did not taste any tequila .
reasonably priced , great service .
the room was old and tiny which i could have dealt with too but the wallpaper in bathroom was filthy . the entire bathroom was dirty .
decor for this place is a bit more trendy .
there 's no hard liquor , just beer and wine .
the service is great , and the staff is attentive . highly recommend !
our server was very attentive and made good suggestions the owner even stopped by and introduced himself !
not bad and they had a great selection of beers on tap and mixed drinks and wine .
the whole combo was $ 9.95 which is super affordable for a decent thai lunch .
the place looks nice , a little too bright but it 's much cozier than villa .
reasonably priced and the service is excellent .
the quality of the sushi was just ok and the decor was boring .
the prices for their lunch combos was pretty reasonable !
staff is very friendly . highly recommend .
the rose water tea is a must try !
i do love the architecture and interior design , but idk , it 's kinda dark and depressing , and not up to date with alot of stuff . my room was kinda crappy and did not have a flat screen like in the picture .
the new spicy stir fried in this restaurant is very delicious and spicy .
this restaurant is a 10 ! i am so excited to have such a yummy restaurant in bethel park !
great sports bar with a lot of tvs , great food , friendly staff and nice lakefront patio for when the weather cools down .
of course we came for the happy hour , the happy hour deals are great !
the atmosphere is very country and comfortable .
the decor was a little weird though . very colorful , but the themes do n't match up .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
but over all they are not cheap neither on chess nor on sauce .
i would not recommend this place to anyone . i am not the type to give bad reviews or complain , but this place has horrible food .
the bean dip was creamy , slightly cheesy , and had a very subtle spiciness to it .
the only thing i was n't a fan of was the lighting .
unfortunately , i wo n't encounter them again .
i understand ayce places can be a tad bit expensive but i ca n't justify having to spend nearly $ 30 for an entire dinner per person so they lose a star for that .
tap water there is terrible but is kind of necessary when drinking cocktails .
i 'm so happy this place exists !
meat was tasteless and tough . rice had no flavor .
great place in scottsdale to grab a bite to eat .
what bothered me was the lighting - it 's very bright , fluorescent and distracting . music was a bit loud and bothersome .
great service great wine list .
our bottle of malbec went perfectly with all the dishes .
worst `` customer service `` from the manager on friday .
however , aside from all the courses being innovative , creative , and bursting with flavors , the various sakes that one can chose from , i have to also talk about the grapefruit sparkling soda .
not going to eat here again thanks to cold food and bad service .
by that i mean , when you were 5 , a classy meal was a happy meal with strawberry fanta .
i originally ordered a peach sangria but they did n't have white wine or something.. but that 's fine because the wild berry sangrias were delicious !
unfortunately the owner had to come out from behind the kitchen & ask us what we had ordered , since we were sitting there for so long .
i walked inside and its a very quaint and cute restaurant .
the chicken protein bowl was good , but i did get some odd chewy pieces of chicken which tends to weird me out .
first time trying and was not happy service was great but the food was horrible dirty plate when food was served chicken tastes like rubber pasta was n't even cooked completely ... area was dirty crayons on the shelf and on the table , took my food to go and threw it away ... . big disappointment ...
with a loud no , no toilets .
my husband got a philly roll which was delicious .
prices are fair as well .
my favorite part of the experience is the infused drink availability . i especially love the cucumber green tea .
portions were really big , we got the honey walnut chicken and the kung pao beef , both were really good !
the beer list was disappointing .
we also had margaritas which you could hardly taste anything but a pre-made margarita mix .
great place with a beautiful bar .
the lighting seemed quite dark to me , not sure if that is appropriate for a bbq joint .
the inside is spacious and comfortable .
small menu but good prices and good food .
after asking us what cocktails we wanted and we replied , `` sorry , we do n't drink '' she rolled her eyes and walked off .
the lunch special for $ 5 is a great value .
reasonably priced . very good for kids .
prices are very reasonable too .
we 're pretty much filled up and it 's pretty tasty . price is fair too .
the beans were dry and needed to have salt added .
we think that the hostess forgot about us ( although we were standing right in front of them ) .
( order it with the egg noodles ) i thought the soup had good flavor , but it was n't strong and tasted a little watered down . the soup was also too spicy for me .
i 've read a few of the bad reviews on here and it seems like they either have a unfounded problem with this establishment or are completely ignorant to what an amazing dining experience should consist of .
burger toppings were awful - looked like they had been cut days ago - and the buns seemed stale . sliders were definitely over cooked .
i get the fact of the hipster décor and approach to almost anything that involves food nowadays , but old christmas decorations lining the walls it just ridiculous .
and the sangria is *really* good .
the roasted red pepper noodles were delicious and the herb roasted chicken was so soft and there was plenty of it .
i ordered the calamari and it was so rubbery and in giant chunks it was unbearable to eat .
the chicken was ok but a little soggy .
the food was good . reasonably priced .
the skin is super smooth and soft .
the baked sea bass filled with nuts and other delicious things was incredible ! and the baklava is to die for !
the prices are decent as well .
very good flavour , generous portions and good service .
i enjoyed every sip of my cucumber cocktail and the bread was fabulous .
this place is way too expensive for what you get in return . i paid 40 $ for lamb shanks and i felt ripped off because it was average
i love this little place ! it 's great in the summer due to the outdoor seating .
the prices are reasonable , the service was good .
it 's cheap too .
i ordered the entree spinach salad which is great - and i 'd had many times before . it comes with chicken and is again , an entree .
the draft list was n't bad but nothing out of the norm .
the atmosphere is just plain stupid and tacky .
we topped off our own wine glasses every time .
the price is reasonable .
great place to drink some bourbon or whiskey and let lose on the dance floor to some good country tunes ! also a great place to watch sports !
the downstairs dining area is quite beautiful .
i 've had better , i 've had worse ... this place was alright .
we had several different pizzas along with some salads and for the most part everything was really good ( especially the salads and the buffalo chicken pizza - delicious ) .
i 'm always excited to come here whether it 's to introduce the place to friends or by myself for a good meal .
beer selection through the roof . not a full bar though , just beer and wine .
and the men 's bathroom was dirty .
two pepperoni or two cheese slices only set me back $ 3 , add in a $ 1 canned drink and i can be full for lunch for $ 4 even .
we had the poutine , which was delicious - it was huge though !
great food , the menudo hit the spot ! awesome service provided by all staff especially arlene , thank you .
i asked about beer selection and was disappointed that they only carried the standard domestics and imports .
the bar tender did n't know the beers on tap , which were only 8 beers .
on a different note , the men 's bathroom was very messy and there was no soap or paper towels anywhere .
do n't expect a lavish layout lol .
especially if each plate is 7 or 8 dollars and you are n't even served .
the broth itself was not as rich and did n't have the collagen it should have had .
the ambiance is pretty cool and inviting . the lighting is just perfect .
very friendly staff and fantastic location .
no idea where they get their furniture or frames or clocks , but it 's like walking into a different era and i 'd eat there more often just for their decor and furniture .
the cocktails were the highlight of the night : the espresso martini and the moscow moose were quite enjoyable .
it 's really cute in there , i love the decor on the wall and the little bar area to enjoy your treats .
i would n't recommend it especially because if the price about 30.00 a person
we ordered bottled beers -- their beer selection is good , i will give them that .
this place has potential but it is unfortunate that the owners are too greedy and cheap to hire more delivery persons .
the staff are very friendly and incredibly knowledgeable , which is always a huge plus in my books !
this is a great and exciting place to eat outside .
the food was all great ( having a few vodka tonics earlier may have helped ) and the iced tea i ordered had perfect flavor .
the only thing i didnt like was the katsu bowl i ordered . the taste got really boring but other than that `` thumbs up ''
the price does seem a bit high to me when paying , and the decor is absolutely outdated .
it was bland and tasteless . seriously - bland .
we did n't eat here , but enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar during happy hour . the staff was friendly , the wine selection was so-so .
the price was quite reasonable , great lunch !
sauce is pretty much the only place i have been going since i discovered it a month ago .
kind of cheezy touristy decor but some of the other reviewers seemed to like it . struck me as kind of a applebees over decoration in mexican theme .
the the dim lighting , grubby decor , and bland menu offer little reason to be nostalgic .
the sheer volume from people talking is so loud that it is nearly impossible to hold a conversation without some sort of signing .
the one weird thing about this place is the lighting .
we left full but not stuffed , a perfect balance for soaking up the booze of the evening .
we only had appetizers but entrees look good.. not a lot of beers on tap but the ones they had were craft beers and were decent choices .
the price is pretty high but it does reflect quality of the food !
martinis are $ 14 each , but i do n't think that 's terrible , since it 's vegas , and each one took like 5-6 minutes to make .
great concept , friendly service but $ 12.95 for a salad and then charged an additional .95 cents for extra dressing , and $ 4 for an iced tea is just outrageous . my total was around $ 18 for a salad meal !
not a good place to study : / or have a work conversation .
they were only good for light beer even thought they said any domestic beer .
18 bucks for a lunch buffet that was pretty much a you get what you pay for deal .
we really enjoyed ourselves . we came in on a monday night and enjoyed their beer and shot special for $ 5 !
one of susur lee 's sons was walking around and mingling with individuals in the restaurant which gave more of an intimate setting .
i like their motto , `` food is not cheap because cheap food is not good . ''
outside dining is beautiful in the evening .
beer wise , stick to bottles .
they were a little dry and overcooked .
the beer i got ( which was the cheapest on tap besides miller lite ) was not bad .
everything came out cold and icky .
we were sat and it took almost 10 minutes for anyone to come up to us ( which i 've waited tables before so they tell you if it 's been 10 minutes it feels like 20 minutes to the guest ) our waitress finally took our drink orders and that took forever to get to us .
the menu consists of plates that are a fusion of our favorite breakfast items and korean , filipino , and peruvian flair .
the hummus was tasty and creamy not super firm like you find in the store . the sliders had grilled onion that made them super yummy , the spicy chicken was perfect with the rice i keep thinking about this wonderful hh dish and the awesome flavor the grape leaves are super good not quite grandma 's but good enough we would order again and we finished them all .
no draft beer - but they have a good bottle selection .
the staff is always very friendly whenever we go there and more than happy to explain the beverages .
convinced my friends to drive a bit away from the strip to visit this place and very glad we did .
i like the place but it 's extremely overpriced for what you get , and the extra whopping $ 2 surcharge for guacamole is highway robbery in my opinion .
feel a bit silly .
decor was weird and oddly spacious ... in a way that indicated they did n't have enough money for more booths .
the noodles and sauce were n't bad , but nothing special . the vegetables were sparse and though the quality of the meat ( chicken for me ) was pretty good , there was n't much of it .
prices are very reasonable .
the prices are pretty fair .
we had been in vegas for a couple days , spending anywhere from $ 60 to $ 150 to feed 4 people , and no joke we noticed earlier in the day bally 's was charging $ 15 for a hot dog , for one hotdog .
the service was very slow and the server did n't know the difference between a draft and bottled beer .
awesome place very fairly priced for what you get .
paint peeling off the walls , chips and discoloration in the floor , counters messed up , but the food is great .
great beer and drink menu .
i was slightly disappointed that they did n't have wine only beer .
great food at a reasonable price .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
5 against one.. does n't seem fair . do not support this casino .
the converted home gives it a nice touch , especially if you have a big group and get a whole room to yourselves .
also at the bar , my mango margarita was very good !
after i noticed that and made it to the front desk i was told i could n't check in because they inserted my name wrong on the hotel reservations .
but the management was nice enough to take it off the check and listen to the problems so until that 's worked out i will be taking my business elsewhere . sad that i really liked you guys .
the food is also reasonably priced for great portions .
about the only negative is the that the music is too loud for the space .
i come here often with family and we will continue to come . food is better when eaten there of course but great little place .
also , the samba juice was a great drink if you are looking for a cocktail .
also , the tv 's they have a very nice , but the layout of the restaurant limits your viewing pleasure . many tables and booths do n't offer good views .
good pizza at a fair price .
for airport food , this place is good , and decently priced .
the prime rib ca n't be beat , it 's carved at the table - hot , juicy and tender .
everything was smooth and flawless and even though i only paid $ 150 for a room that normally costs upwards of $ 300 , the service that we received was definitely no indicator of how much we paid .
the chicken fingers were also amazing ( my boys got them and i had to try a bite , of course ) .
i do n't know how any type of management allows that , poor service and awful experience we may give this place one more chance in hopes to regain the experiences we used to have but we will not be returning to sandy if she is there we will be requesting anywhere not in that section .
everything is pretty cheap .
for wine , we had the pinot noir . the service , food , and the wine were all impeccable .
and not too expensive .
i have tried the specials , and all of the seafood items . all are fantastic .
everything is a la carte , so i paid $ 13 , which is n't a great value , but at least they provide quality food that you wo n't immediately regret putting inside of your body .
not sure why people rave about the margaritas , i think they either have no tequila , or it 's severly watered down .
make no mistake , the lady behind the counter was ten times ruder and more unpleasant than anything you can imagine .
the flavor was pretty bland ... nothing exciting .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
with yard house setting the bar in this genre , this place just looks weak .
it has a very charming feel and the space is not too big . the bar area is small but cozy .
i had the basil gimlet and she sipped on garden mojito , and they were both refreshing and delicious .
great staff and you can expect to pay from about $ 30 . to 50.00 / person , depending on what you want .
there were the normal beer options ( no craft ) and the wine was barefoot so nothing to write home about .
walking in we really liked the lay out of the restaurant with the bar separated from the dining room and the decor was cool and cozy with the hanging candles from the ceiling .
beer was good too and they even had drinks even if do n't drink beer .
always fresh and always good ! thomas , the maitre de is always courteous and friendly .
i typically come during lunch time and the line is super long , but it actually moves quick . the place is always clean , and the staff is super friendly and helpful .
the chicken was chewy and tasted old .
unfortunately it 's not even cheap to justify the quality .
really dry and bad and should not have been served .
pretty darn good and fantastic prices .
price-wise it 's a bit steeper than i 'd like ( ended up costing around $ 40 per person after tax and tips ) , but there is a happy hour if you arrive before 5pm for a few bucks off !
it 's a good value .
also , i 'd highly recommend the espresso martini .
waitress argued with us over the food items and kind of threw down drinks and walked away .
the chicken was very bland so i would n't say it was worth the $ 5 .
the coffees are frequently empty and no one seems to know about it behind the counter because i guess they just do n't typically check on their supply .
we did n't order anything else , but the staff kept our drinks filled and attended all of our needs .
blah . no one was mean and bottled beer is bottled beer but i might as well have stayed home .
some positives ... the food came fast , and it was a pretty decent atmosphere , we sat in the dining room not lounge .
not the cheapest place around , but i 'd rather spend more for something great than save a few bucks for something mediocre .
food was ok , but we were annoyed that we waited 1.5 hours to be seated when there were empty tables the entire time ... we started to wonder if she was mad at certain wait staff members and trying to spite them by not sitting people in their sections .
however i was mad at whoever sent him over there at 8 o'clock in the morning on a holiday week .
the dressing itself was bland and nothing special . i did not finish the salad .
the expresso drinks also come with a free palmier on the side .
inside was just as perfect and finally a restaurant where you can sit inside and have a conversation .
champagne framboise is a great sparkling cocktail and mixed perfectly to not have too much flavor overpowering the sparkling wine .
the drinks were slightly pricy but delicious , the lychee margarita was probably my favorite .
the cashier gentleman seemed promising , until he was rolling his eyes at me taking my order and would only answer my questions with , yes or no , or even a head shake .
the food is very reasonably priced and is super good .
nice wine choices and mixed drinks are available .
the decor was a little dated and outright weird to say the least .
any mistake they make they 'll just try to deny it and blame it on you and not try to offer a solution of any kind .
but the beer was disappointing .
the drinks were delicious and they have an excellent selection of liquor and beer .
the quality of the fish was wonderful . the roll choices were all creative .
the margarita was n't anything special either .
decent quality food but overpriced .
a lot of unique rum drinks .
the prices are reasonable .
reasonably priced , and predictable .
i called in our order and it took me repeating everything 3 to 4 times to get it right .
first , the decor - yes , it 's all about nacho libre with not only images of masked wrestlers on the walls , but the taps were masked too .
prices are good as well .
worst service ever ! you wait on average 20-25 min just to get your drink order .
6 beers on tap and only one watered down version if a beer , so that 's a plus .
no one at any time of day look or feel good under fluorescent lights .
sample the tea and lemonade , was very refreshing to drink on this hot day .
price is a bit on the high side but its what you expect for such a world class meal .
everything was fantastic . the space is trendy and beautiful and there is plenty of seating near the windows for great people watching .
simple and fast . the employees there are very friendly .
beautiful restaurant with both inside and outside seating .
to my surprise he got the manager over and i told here how the steak was and she did generously offer to bring me a new one without making me feel bad .
wine was chilled and very good .
very good food at fair prices .
there were only 3 tables of customers and we were in there an hour and a half .
we think they switched the type of mozzerella that they use , maybe we are wrong , but the flavor of the cheese is n't as good .
the service was very slow and the server did n't know the difference between a draft and bottled beer .
the menu prices are also very reasonable .
the mapo tofu with rice was okay and the baked cream shrimp & cheese on rice was okay but definitely not worth the price $ 13 as there was only 5 shrimps .
took too long to get the bill but other than that the service was as always attentive .
the beer selection was pretty poor so i ended up with a whiskey cocktail instead .
my wife and i happened to see a yelp advertisement for this restaurant and thought it looked cool and inviting , we made a reservation for the outdoor seating at 8:30 on a friday night .
great food - a hidden gem ! i 'm surprised this place is not busier .
the food was ok , again , nothing special .
the carpet is disgusting with garbage all over the place and the utensils and tablecloths with questionable at best . the bright lighting emphasized the filth .
unfortunately , it was disappointing .
the drinks are exceptional .
to top it off no draft beer in the theater only the bar ?
i found the hostess desk up front to have awful customer service both in person and on the phone .
only four beers on tap , none of which were particularly good .
on a different note , the men 's bathroom was very messy and there was no soap or paper towels anywhere .
the reason you spend $ here is because it 's just that good .
very dumb because there was no reason other than `` looking cool '' in the kitchen when they made it .
bleh , not much good to say .
fantastically delicious tacos . simple yet fresh and savory .
they have done a great job with this place .
the dining area was pretty loud - much louder than i expected .
i hate spending money on food and leaving unsatisfied !
we came here for oyster happy hour . oysters were fresh and cheap and we ordered a bottle of champagne to go with .
great wine selection , though i ended up getting the white sangria , which was refreshing .
the wine prices are reasonable .
( note : for being such a upscale and nice hotel with a `` reputation '' you would think their employees uniforms would be more elegant and classy than the pepto bismol skirt suit the hostesses wear .
but the view is spectacular .
the cost was outrageous .
the view is really nice but that is all .
the high prices are not justified by for the mediocre food .
at patio bar i come here weekly , love the country band tony marques .
prices are n't cheap at all so prepare to pay $ 7-10 for a juice/smoothie .
draft beer was not as cold as it should be , order bottles . crappy music .
service was great and it did n't take long to get our food .
under dimmed lights the tiny font menu is almost impossible to read .
beer was cold but all the mixed drinks had almost no alcohol .
attentive and friendly service from brian made the meal most enjoyable .
for the price it 's great .
i love my arby 's especially at night because they are open until 1am . i get off late from work and there 's not a lot of places open late
food was ok ... my snow crab was dry and lobster was a bit over done .
the staff is wonderful and very polite .
the food was amazing and our waiter was very polite , accommodating and thorough .
it is pretty expensive but you get what you pay for .
a friend recommended it and i am really glad we decided to give it a try .
nothing special about the dishes we ordered .
the grits with the pork belly was by far the best dish .
what a cool little place !
even the sides are excellent , and the cocktails and sangria top everything off .
i felt bad and i did n't want to give them a hard time , so i waited patiently for my food that i called in for pick-up .
the berry drink is pure vodka that is soaked with fruit for ten days . dangerous and a perfect drink .
they have great small dishes and a wonderful selection of wine and cocktails .
pretty good food and reasonable prices .
food is reasonable and the all you can eat menu is vast .
excellent team work and very well-managed . keep up the great job !
decor is nice , but the only thing that bothers me about this place is the fact that there are circle prints on the walls .
not a big buffet guy but this food looked really good and tasted pretty good .
i love sitting outside of this place in nice weather on their picnic benches amongst the chill vibe .
things like the establishment being too loud or having `` outdated decor '' wo n't ruin my meal .
the view is great for sunset but the drinks are expensive , $ 10- $ 15 for normal size cocktails .
i then switched to beer - they have a pretty good beer list available , too .
honestly i was surprised the meals are predominately under $ 10 ... .
the price point is pretty high , so expect to spend at least $ 20 here .
is the fighting over dramatic and corny ?
added bonus is that they have a great patio with umbrellas that is pet friendly , so you can bring your pooch on a nice day !
seating is a tad cramped and tables close but the food is delicious .
beautiful interior and quiet .
now that sounds great , but she was standoffish and condescending .
the mix they used was a cheap quality fake lime flavor .
the interior 's nothing fancy but it was n't uncomfortable and was fun to read some of the signs on the wall .
and i always feel so super bad for having to itemize receipts on a group dinner , but when i get the $ 39 halibut and someone else gets a $ 13 salad , it is what it is .
we did n't try any beer but the beer list was impressive .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
i unfortunately was not able to eat indoors because we sat at the bar outside , but it was an amazing view because you can see all the kitchen crew prepare the different type of tacos .
maybe it is the odor of fresh carpet ( weird because it is n't carpeted ) but it is super dark in there .
decided to check out this place with my fiancé and we loved it !
well the restaurant is very nice , but the bathroom disgusting , toilet paper all over the place , no air freshener .
this place had an all around excellent upscale experience .
stuff like that can happen but to just say sorry and charge for an item we did n't even touch is crazy .
i had fried chicken and honestly could n't finish , it tasted so dry and old .
i gave this one a three stars mostly because we ordered a pitcher or margarita and honestly i did not taste any tequila .
the margarita was nice and refreshing .
the energy , lighting and cleanliness was awful .
i would highly recommend the skate fish with lemon risotto .
the servings were huge so that was nice : ) . i had the most amazing cocktail with perrier jouet , raspberry , and elderflower , so that helped out the meal a little .
and the bartender definitely knew how to pour a good , strong drink .
the place has a cool feel , open and airy .
the scenery is very nice .
dinner prices for lunch is way too expensive .
anyway ... the chicken : i ordered the three piece boneless plain .
price is really decent too .
the traditional chinese cooked dishes are of good quality and are hot and freshly made .
the food is acceptable ... no complaints there , but the price they charge is in the order of $ 2-4 more than their competitors in the area ... which is quite significant for an entree that 's only around $ 10 . their portion size is really small now as noted earlier .
the ambiance is nice and it seems like a fun place to hang out and have a drink .
the noodles were the best and ginger honey green tea nice a sweetened to perfection .
got the malay laksa and it was bland . they gave some free pork cutlet and it was bland as well .
we have never had a bad experience .
had a very good experience here .
cute quaint italian spot , great for happy hour or to grab a quick bite . helps to have a reservation as it does get packed .
they were playing awesome diner type music , but way more fast paced and extremely busy .
nice place but for 1 pizza , two kid drinks , 2 beers and a small salad it was about $ 67 w tip .
great people , great food , low price .
you will not be disappointed .
the salmon was ground fresh the only thing is it was lacking in flavor .
i was completely full for 6 dollars .
nice place and the service is always friendly .
the waitress ignored the entire dining room , except for bringing food out .
it took the waitress a good 15 minutes to come over and ask for our drink order .
today is a perfect day for a patio weather if u want to enjoy the scenery while eating .
the only thing i did n't enjoy was the spring rolls - seemed like they had come from a frozen package .
prices are on the higher side , but you absolutely get what you pay for .
the veal itself was cooked perfectly as it was moist and juicy and i ended up enjoying it .
the food here are delicious , which has no doubt . however , the customer service is rude .
the bar is great and comfortable with plenty of high tops , but they also boast a large heated patio .
i did however notice different beer selection in the bottle .
the kitchen manager and beverage director alisa made us our own specially crafted cocktails by pairing fresh roasted fruits with select spices to prepare amazing drinks that were n't even on the menu .
excellent ! shrimp tempura was so delicious and fresh !
the restaurant itself is kind of ... dingy .
lighting and decor is kind of trashy ... but i did like the meal .
moved out to the west valley over 2 years ago and could not find anything good until this place .
the interior design appears to be done by a blind person from the 80s .
new remodeled ( restaurant and employees ) , service is fast , employees are nice .
but , on two different occasions i have called and asked if they accept reservations they said no .
( so small you ca n't even grab the fish ) some of the rolls are very tough and you just end chewing for a while , i mean i even thought they left a piece of plastic in my roll but it was just the seaweed .
i love this place !
dimly lit so they do provide flashlights , yes i am serious .
also the bathroom stinks and is kinda dirty .
i thought the beer prices were pretty reasonable ; food prices , little high .
i 'm willing to pay $ 30 or more for an exceptional breakfast for two - otherwise , i 'll go pay $ 5 at a cheap and easy diner .
overall a very pleasant experience with great food !
the waiter was attentive , but not over-bearing and the sommelier 's recommendation were very on spot . the food was fantastic .
worse yet those things cost 7 $ a pop .
cheerful waitress , happy to offer suggestions .
great wine menu to boot
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
the one thing i missed in the beer list was an indication of how many ounces they pour for the different beers .
bar service was good , ruined by one hostess .
all that food for only 7 dollars it does n't get better then that .
( not so good ) kinda creepy .
they have good happy hour prices on drinks - perfect for a date night !
the waitress that was working the register did n't say a word the entire time we were paying and checking out .
strike 1. atmosphere is n't just lacking , it 's downright awkward and uncomfortable .
i 've never heard any atmospheric music being played , the carpet is ugly , the furniture is boring and dark , and there is no privacy offered by the interior design .
prices were very reasonable also .
came here for lunch for an ayce at $ 18 once and i thought that 's a pretty good price .
not a big deal or the restaurant 's fault , just really annoying and creepy .
this place is extremely clean ! wow we were really impressed on how clean this place is .
it was scream across the table and barely be understood kind of loud . it was `` i wish they 'd turn it from from building shaking to just ear splitting '' kind of loud . it was just give up and write notes on a napkin kind of loud .
my big problem was the ambience ... dusty dried flowers and picture frames ... filthy carpet , and do not use the restroom .
- although they only had three beers on tap , at least they were good craft beer choices .
only four beers on tap , none of which were particularly good .
the waiter rush us to order after giving us the menu . when we asked what was good he rushing us .
the drinks are very potent so beware .
it 's good value for our money and i love the applewood smoked sausage .
this was not a cheap dinner as we paid like 55 bucks with tip , although it was an insane amount of food .
the tacos themselves were very underwhelming . the meat was cold and all of the ingredients lacked seasoning .
good pricing . good value on food .
staff were friendly and the food was great .
the good earth pita is also amazing .
if you 're looking for a unique , small place in charlotte , go visit !
prices were cheap and reasonable .
the pad thai is not the best that i 've had but everything else i 've tried here is awesome !
it can be cheap . it 's decent sushi .
the atmosphere was good .
the beer is cheap but the beer is also awful ; my boyfriend drinks a lot of beer and we went on national beer day .
i think there were only 3 or 4 beers offered , draft and bottled .
the ugly : it 's worn .
a star is not even what i wanted to write for this dennys , it deserves absolutely no stars what so ever .
these servers looked dumpy and just bizarre styling !
their prices otherwise are also super inexpensive . great atmosphere .
our service was so terrible .
the decor was done very nicely , but they ruined it with the lighting .
great staff and great quality for a decent price .
the walls are brightly colored , which i enjoyed a lot , but along one side was a series of illustrations depicting ... a person ?
it 's about $ 10 with a drink for a decent sized burger .
basically the perfect experience for happy hour at a cocktail bar .
if you do n't feel like paying $ 50 for steak , head over here for a decent cut of meat with delicious sauces , all for under $ 30 .
only tried the pizza and so far no complaints . it was a good thin crust pizza .
great drink menu , great food .
- good space and chill vibe . the outside patio is good from happy hour and day drinking on a nice day out .
this place has good food but is really expensive at $ 30+ per person .
the beers were ok , nothing special .
the restaurant itself , however , was quite beautiful and had a nice atmosphere .
love sitting on the patio . it 's nice eating salad out side and looking at the beautiful view of tempe arizona .
came here on a friday and was pleased with their service .
he made our dining experience great .
i 've heard it can be very crowded here so i was glad to catch it during a slow time .
had a great evening here .
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
i had a terrace room with a pretty good view .
my soup was barely warm , hot tea was warm and no lemon in my water .
the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting .
the garage doors which open up the dining room are really cool .
we ordered the poached chicken signature dish and our chicken was raw and pink not to mention cold .
pricey food lack of customer service do n't accept any credit card food not great .
although the price was a bit high , it 's justified by the amount of food you get .
it 's expensive , but you get what you pay for .
for $ 10 plus change , this was a fantastic find .
sadly i did n't get a beer .
as for the drinks , after all it is a bar , they having a variety of specialty cocktails and a great bartender ( chris ) that is sure to mix you up something you will love .
good price drinks and glasses of wine .
it 's sort of a bizarre set up .
i was so excited to try this restaurant .
for a couple it 's the perfect setting .
nice atmosphere - located right in st mark 's square .
the atmosphere is intimate .
the prices are amazingly affordable .
the decor was very simple yet effective in giving that `` wow '' factor .
i go for lunch and the service is always kind and accommodating .
the view from the top is fantastic especially to see the bellagio fountains . its funny they openly use the bellagio fountains as marketing for the restaurant in the tower as well as the view from the top .
clean enough . decent prices .
i was there during lunch time and i waited 35 minutes for service . very expensive $ $ $ $
we are only had a couple of apps the hummus is amazing !
to be honest , the entrance and bathrooms are actually kind of scary .
great place to grab a bite late . enjoy !
delicious lasagna , pizza , and pastas .
this is my favorite lunch by work , and just $ 7 ! beware the line can be long at prime time , so i go a little early like 11:30. i love the thai fried rice , roasted garlic bulbs , buttery brussel sprouts , beef brisket with au jus , and terrific seabass baked with cream , cilantro , and tomatoes .
mulligans is overrated , with so-so food and an impatient wait staff .
food was good , drinks were great , service was just okay . our waiter was a little bit unfriendly but ultimately did n't mind much .
i do n't remember which draft beers i had , but i enjoyed them . looked like a good bottle selection as well .
i ordered a salad , some meatballs and a glass of wine on the happy hour menu .
the linens were neat , no ugly 90 's geometric pattern on the comforter , unfortunately it was on the curtains and on the carpet . the bathroom was small , but clean .
patio was great and so was the weather .
love this place ... .nice place to study , to get a pretty good coffee and listen good music .
the meat options are nearly endless , and simply seasoned which makes them all so good .
our waitress did n't do anything that stood out , she was boring and had no personality .
good food at cheap price on the strip . ca n't beat it .
took one star off for the expensive prices .
both were excellent ( especially the beef medallions ) ! the meats were done perfectly and the service was very good .
i had banana leaf wrapped sea bass - the best i have ever had . our new favorite restaurant .
great prices , too .
my husband had the trout and he said it was bland and did n't expect the quinoa to be cold .
i had the seasonal sangria - very good !
the decor was miserable and gaudy .
there pricing was very reasonable !
first of all , they only have beer and wine , no liquor .
my husband and friend 's boyfriend had beer ; the beer selection was pretty limited so if you do n't like negro modelo i would stick to a cocktail or wine .
they do have a nice outdoor patio area , you just have to get past all the snobby looks .
everything about this hotel is beautiful ; the outside , inside , and the rooms themselves ! the bathroom is huge !
from jazz nights to open mic nights - it 's a great place to go to expose yourself to music you might have never liked .
all their dishes look amazing here ! my girlfriend loves their raspberry lemonade drink .
the fried sesame ball was different than what i was used to .
nice bar , good atmosphere .
good but you 'll pay for it . expensive for the portions .
the food is consistently good and the cost ( 13.99 for lunch ) is very reasonable .
it 's super cute , full of british touches and adorable decor . i recommend eating outside .
so i started with a açaí berry mojito that 's was so good .
the environment is pretty chill , we sat outside since it was packed inside .
host was very pleasant , waitress a little snotty - in total average service .
great food , cocktail , and beer menu .
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
behind the bar is beautiful mural of trees , over the dining area is a gorgeous blue ceiling .
pretty chill , ordered my passion green tea and enjoyed every last sip .
the ugly - too many tables in such less space . i felt horribly claustrophobic inside especially with the lights being so dim .
the spicy mango salmon bowl was great .
also , pretty cheap for food and drink especially if you have the daily specials .
everything was dry , tasteless , and inundated with onion .
it 's all awesome . super fresh tasting and just really , really good .
the abundance of other reviews complaining about the server 's crap attitudes should be enough to keep you away .
i would have loved to hang out with my companion and conversed leisurely but the loud atmosphere made it impossible .
only negative thing i 'll say is the bathroom area was dirty ! the hallway to the bathroom was pretty gross .
it was a little expensive considering $ 17 for a sandwich however they do not skimp on the lobster !
great food ... terrible service ! every meal tasted great and the mixed drinks were delicious but as soon as we would get our food or drinks , that was the last time we would see our server until we would `` find '' them and suggest we got our check after waiting half an hour on them .
great ambiance and decor .
if you want a quick and cheap bite to eat this is the place on the strip . $ 1.59 chicken tacos and $ 2.99 for large fries .
the food was not terrible , so i 'll leave you with 2 stars , but the service ?
have seconds that are great for freezing or canning . many varieties of apples in season as well .
warm people and a cozy atmosphere .
excellent service . our waitress was very helpful .
i thought for sure it would be an hour wait , but the hostess said 20-30 minutes .
i really liked the ambiance even the darkness because the table lighting was adequate to read the menu .
however , no beer menu . weird .
reasonably priced and good service .
it was n't until after i said something to the manager about waiting for 38 minutes for a single beer and a burger that my stuff finally came out .
i do n't even care about the bright lighting or off decor ( or there lack of ) .
i was also totally weirded out that the bathroom had mirrored walls .
this is continues to be my favourite restaurant in # yyc . the food is fantastic , the servers very capable and the vibe enjoyable and fulfilling .
the food was bland resembling microwave frozen food . no one was impressed .
the prices are reasonable and serving size is decent .
if only the walls could talk .
pretty expensive pizza for not great quality
the crust is not too thin and not too thick and just the right amount of crisp . go and try !
the worker amy needs to be more awake next time she works a graveyard shift since she seemed like she had an attitude and we were not greeted and during our whole ordering time she was just staring at us so awkwardly ! it 's just terrible customer service !
for decent price . $ 6 8 '' thin crust is plenty for me .
and the service was so friendly and the place was quiet and clean a wonderful lunch experience .
good food . price is reasonable .
excellent food . both quality and quantity wise excellent .
the quality of the sushi was very mediocre . the sushi rice overpowered the sushi and was too vinegary .
it 's quite expensive .
the bathroom is n't necessarily dirty , but it is very rundown .
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
in their defense , the bottled beer was good .
the view was amazing .
loud thumping music at the pool so could n't relax there .
their fresh made drinks , i had mango pineapple was refreshing .
ridiculous prices for very subpar everything .
the atmosphere of the shop can be kind of awkward because of the bad lighting and awkward silences .
we started with the chicken nachos - yummy and filling ! the we split the fuego and added shrimp .
i 'm pretty sure what i got ( orange chicken and sweet and sour pork ) was not even real meat .
did n't drink , but good draft selection . reccomended .
also , there was nothing else in the bun , only the small patty .
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
we had a very nice bottle of wine .
no hot water or paper towels , dirty , and down a sketchy hallway .
the night started weak , but ended strong .
the broth - the most important part of ramen - was like water ( not enough taste to even call it bland ) .
the food is edible , but not good .
we started with the pepperoni pizza rolls which are an absolute must when you dine here .
the bartenders are all extremely sweet and knowledgeable of all their 44 drafts .
the bartender was pretty bad .
price is very reasonable .
they do n't serve hard alcohol but have beer and wine .
$ 3 tacos and cheap drinks . this place is awesome .
we met our friend dave here and it was nice just to have a beer in a brewery nearby .
however , i did not enjoy the pad thai it was way too sweet and for that they are getting three stars .
it 's older and seems wore out . what drove me crazy was how thin the walls are , i could hear phone conversations , toilets flushing , and the guy snoring all night .
with thirty some craft beers and wines on tap , beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender .
highly recommend this place !
the opah was dry ( very dry ) .
he helped make for a fabulous experience and we will certainly be coming back !
i highly recommend avoiding this location .
looks like a nice bar , too .
definitely happy to have them in az .
all are reasonably priced .
it was savoury and the portion was perfect ( although i was forcing the last few bites down only because i did n't think it would make a good nuked re-heat ) .
i was definitely happy with my decision to switch up my lunchtime location and i will for sure be coming back in the future .
or 2.5 it 's kind of confusing how the layout of the mall works out .
nice and garlicky and melted in your mouth .
the mango martini was fantastic , but beware that it 's grey goose infused with mango - there 's no mango juice - these are strong .
for the price you pay you should not have high expectations anyway .
it is a bit pricey but you basically get what you pay far .
reasonably priced , love the chirashi bowl ... it is literally huge and comes with more sushi than you can eat ... tuna , shrimp , yellowtail all with a yummy sweet garlic sauce . i order a side of ponzu sauce as well .
excellent food , drinks ( especially the lemon drop martini ) and service !
i ordered the porn star martini , which was fabulous !
i love their salads here .
when you walk in you are greeted by a wide open space that does n't necessarily feel like a bar .
soon found out that the super attentive staff did table service .
had an amazing 3 course meal with a beer during a hookah sesh listening to good music .
beautiful location and fabulous decor !
beer - the beer selection was nothing special and they do n't serve it in a cold glass .
we chose a bottle of albarino wine to go with it all and enjoyed our time at chica .
thought the name meant beer or good drinks . beers were pricey .
the decor was a little weird though . very colorful , but the themes do n't match up .
service is wonderful and everyone who works there hustles with joy .
it was amazing , the apple slices add a fresh crunch and sweetness to the sandwich .
i was okay with it but dining companion hated it .
weak drinks , there i said it .
way to expensive for the quality of the food .
yep you guessed it , the bathroom floor . disgusting .
the florescent lights are not only stained , filthy and flashing , but also different colors .
i do n't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine .
i also love that they bring you a pitcher of iced water and a carafe of coffee .
friday 's is $ 3 drafts and music bingo ! awesome space on the rooftop bar area .
it 's disappointing given $ 14 for a lunch .
the most disappointing thing though was that i could n't taste the tequila in my margarita and when i ordered two more shots to add the bartender got offended . would never recommend
hidden gem if you 're looking for a simple lunch that 's very reasonably priced ( ~ $ 7 ) and delicious .
we drive to henderson for his great service and awesome suggestions , please , keep up the great work !
the bartender was pretty bad .
ca n't go wrong for under 40 $
good lunch prices . the rolls are also a fair price !
sadly i did n't get a beer .
this place was great and the panzanella salad was so good too !
the the dim lighting , grubby decor , and bland menu offer little reason to be nostalgic .
the dollar speaks and when the atmosphere is horrible the dining experience is horrible . food was so so .
did n't get a drink but looked like a nice selection of beers on tap .
i also had a bite of the crab cakes , which were delicious .
the desserts were all terrible and clearly made with cheap ingredients .
i thought the amenities , bars , restaurants , and casino floor were very nice .
i had the shrimp etouffee and it was excellent the shrimp were fresh and the roux was perfect .
we sat at the bar and enjoyed both the happy hour special charcuterie and a glass of rose on special .
make sure check your bill before paying . they charged unnecessary small dish for no reasons .
funny story , we tipped the waitress just a little over 15 % like good restaurant goers but as she picked up the bill two toonies fell out and intro her serving pouch without her even noticing .
blah . no one was mean and bottled beer is bottled beer but i might as well have stayed home .
by this time food was cold and the gravy on the meatballs was caked on .
the chicken was cooked perfectly and the sides of green beans and cilantro rice and fries were so yummy !
and i 'm still not sure why we waited so long , because it was not busy .
a piano bar which is perfect for those not looking for a club atmosphere .
the ugly - too many tables in such less space . i felt horribly claustrophobic inside especially with the lights being so dim .
a bright colored rug / blanket hangs on the wall , drowning out notice of any other wall decor that might have been there .
great place to drink bottomless mimosas , relax and people watch ! bellagio is just across from hexx kitchen so ask for a table outdoors .
yes it was only $ 4.99 but that was still overpriced .
i have no idea why people can even rat this stuff considering it 's run poorly .
there was sweet pineapple , cantaloupe , grapes and strawberries and it did n't have that weird funky taste that most fruit cups have to keep it from turning brown .
staff friendly . valet guys are great ambassador first customer service impression .
food is okay . relatively cheap and also quick .
and the price is very reasonable .
a pretty good lunch spot and not too expensive .
the brisket sand which is sweet and tangy , must try .
sadly our first experience at this fine restaurant was beyond subpar when it came to how welcome the hostess made us feel .
a little on the high price though .
the price is right too .
the drinks were n't `` weak '' !
you may even feel unsafe because of the poor lighting and somewhat dingy appearance .
this place was awesome ! very nice service , fresh food and everything came out in a timely manner .
you get a great view of 17th on the patio and the upbeat music definitely makes you want to dance !
the only issue you will have is that your entire part needs to be there in order to be seated so plan ahead .
this is a great place to stop for lunch . people were extremely friendly and the food was good .
service was attentive and nice .
decent service , nice space .
i think the bartender may only be good at pouring beer .
all the food tastes amazing and authentic .
minimalist interior , i mean seriously .
i was n't really pleased with the ambiance either because it had a gaudy interior design .
my husband loves the chinese sichuan chicken & my favorite is the creamy spicy chicken from the old menu .
no margaritas . just beer and wine : -/ what 's a girl to do .
the soup was excellent as well as all the entrees we ordered .
i wish they would of just told me or offered a wet towel to help me clean it up .
not sure why people rave about the margaritas , i think they either have no tequila , or it 's severly watered down .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
oh , and reeeeally weird art in the girl 's bathroom ... .
service was fast but not attentive and it took us repeated attempts to get a vegetable dish order acknowledged .
come for the happy hour drinks and appetizers .
i 'm so glad we found it !
great experience , was there on a sunday midday to watch some of the football games , great atmosphere , the dj plays good music plus sound effects when the main game is on the big screen . place is super clean , great service and food is good
no $ 5 special .
no tap beer , no blended drinks for a decent margaritas and out of steak for tacos .
the prices are reasonable .
surprisingly priced reasonably for the massive amount of food you get !
we also enjoyed 2 bottles of wine .
it honestly tasted like they steamed or boiled their meat .
you will not be disappointed .
the only drawback was the food took forever to come out .
the bad : the washrooms are somewhat clean , but you would n't even think of that when see all the gravity plastered on the walls .
each table comes with a sealed decanter of water , and the service was prompt and friendly with cool jazz playing on the speakers .
the topping options are plentiful and fresh and the hot sauce and mango sauce are home made .
our server was quite pleasant and helpful .
good outdoor mall but the layout is a little weird . mostly everything you need all in this area .
the atmosphere was loud and friendly which will make you feel happy .
another note is that the artwork on the walls was depressing .
not a great value .
the fleet of smokers are right there behind the building .
if youre too cheap to advertise using legitimate methods such as online or physical mail , then clearly there is something wrong with the business .
for under $ 8 , not that bad a place for a lunch buffet .
we all tried the endless appetizers option and they were all excellent .
i do n't mind paying more for good food , but this is your typical bar and grill type dishes , and a bill for two should n't total $ 70 at the end of the night with no drinks and subpar food .
my bulkogi bowl was so salty ... i mean way way too salty . i think it was an overkill of soy sauce or something because i was struggling to finish it all .
service & atmosphere inside the bar area was comfortably wonderful .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
not only is the quality worth the bucks , but the quantity is well over enough .
the mash potatoes were good and the mac was delicious with a kick perhaps pepperjack .
great staff that is knowledgable .
both were relatively small , about 5 '' across and rather bland .
however , customer service was disappointing and unorganized ... it took us 15 min .
the atmosphere is great and the place is decorated well with an awesome view of the lake
the food is incredibly reasonably priced .
luckily they give you an option while waiting in line to preorder your pizza so that they have it to your table within 15 minutes of sitting down .
taste was okay . nothing special .
-- and the alcohol and beer lists are excellent . the bartenders and servers are great , too .
& they have an awesome selection of teas & a pretty nice wine list .
she is great and creative at her craft and exercises professionalism from small catering to big ones . i love working with kristina !
they were cold and i barely had the equivalent of a tablespoon of guacamole . there was probably a half a cup of chicken on the nachos .
so you have to pay for the full serving for the unique flavors and a lot of them range $ 25+ which is kind of ridiculous .
we also had margaritas which you could hardly taste anything but a pre-made margarita mix .
waited almost a hour because we wanted a table . the table turn around times took long but it all paid off when we finally got sat and food started coming out .
lunch special deal is pretty good .
weak service , beer on tap was two things : warm and stale .
but wow their prices are high .
for such a good meal and getting out of there only spending 26 dollars including tip i think that this is a wonderful spot to grab a meal .
walls are chipped up and needing attention and the lighting is just too bright .
they have an excellent selection , and a very good wine list .
all staff extremely pleasant .
salad was ok -- guac was boring on it and corn mixture seemed like it was from a can .
sauce did n't taste right either .
with just one server managing the bar area and the dining area needless to say the service yet again was terrible .
it was the best ever . the fish was so fresh and unique .
popular spot . friendly staff .
the prices are fair and the food is good .
also very reasonably priced .
great bartenders , delicious drinks and specials .
also , i do n't like my food thrown at me and the window slammed so i have no chance to ask for something if its not right .
did n't feel uncomfortable and parking was plentiful and good lighting .
the food here was hot and delicious .
amazing selection of drinks .
i like the cozy atmosphere . it 's a nice spot to bring a date .
sit on the patio if it 's nice enough outside .
their food is pretty good and the environment is chill and relaxing .
i really enjoyed coming here for lunch .
it was not bad but all the food was pretty typical and average . i 've had better kebabs elsewhere and nothing was that flavourful .
great that it 's byob , $ 2.50 per person though .
the food was not super but good prices reasonable .
there is something special about the soda shop , maybe its the nostalgia you feel when listening to sock hop music or drinking your chocolate malt .
cheap ok wines by the glass .
we also had the monday evening special - order a glass of wine ( or other drink ) and get a panini with chips for free .
staff was friendly though and service was great .
we ate the chicken which was good but did n't seem to be fresh and was only warm .
service and attitude i just got , horrible .
the three pieces of roast pork had a dry texture and was uninspiring .
food was horrible , they could n't even properly make rice or lo mein . i know it 's a buffet but at some point you got to replace your food .
good food . good prices .
we ordered beers and were served some beer cocktail they were n't bad but i just wanted the beer not a cocktail .
and super cheap considering it 's so much food !
not total hipster but it was just a weird setting .
i first ordered the garlic bread with c , which was n't really impressive but ok i suppose for the price .
great place for drinks !
so the sushi rice was hard .
the menus are so cool .
i saw some liquor bottles but did n't focus long enough to say whether they have a decent selection of tequila or not .
so i got up and stopped one of the servers and asked her if someone could seat me , give me a menu or something , and she went to find a hostess . she came back and said they ignored her so she proceeded to seat me in her section , which i was thankful for , since i was able to finally order .
price is extremely reasonable .
( i 'm not sure that is a word but think exposed brick with fancy pendant lights ) .
great service and very cute environment- will definitely be back !
i felt like i was drinking the oil and it honestly made me so sick afterwards .
this was our first visit to i love pho and we were very pleased with both the food and the service .
$ 4 and $ 5 drinks on special were perfect .
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
my husband literally spit out his duck on the plate because it was so poorly prepared .
very cheap and tasty food .
this is my favorite local pizzeria . in downtown carnegie , this is a great place to order from on a friday night .
the music was relaxing and not loud .
we enjoyed plenty of wine and scotch drinks .
my delivery took almost 2 hours to arrive when i was quoted 30 minutes , and when my food arrived it was so cold the pizza had gone stiff . frustrated , i called back to be told i was a liar , and that they refused to do anything about the terrible service and even worse food .
i had the braised chicken and it was tender and tasty . my wife had the chicken chipotle salad it was fresh with great flavor .
my friend ordered a steak plate and i tried a piece , but it felt like the steak was tough and over cooked .
they are always friendly and accurate and keep the line moving during the lunch rush .
it was happy hour so i had a wine and a burger .
finally , the interior lighting is a bit odd .
i always feel weird about presenting coupons because i worry i will look like a giant cheapskate or that there will be some fine print i did n't follow .
then the chicken and steak was cooked up , with only salt and pepper , so pretty bland there ... we were also given grilled onions and zucchini , also bland ... so i wo n't be going back ... perhaps i just ordered the wrong thing , but it was n't too exciting for the price .
an amazing selection of craft drinks and adult beverages ; ) .
my wife and i had the crab cake appetizer , which i would also highly recommend . and the chocolate soufflé cake finished off the meal perfectly .
as for the crawfish , we had the cajun seasoning and it was so dry and bland .
but let me say to guy , the veggie burger was the worse i have ever eaten and that includes frozen .
no , it was 2 nearly burned , cold , half pizzas .
the price was quite good considering its location .
it appeared to have been cooked in some kind of yellowish sauce .
we had an excellent dinner with my tripe , gut and vegetable soup that came sizzling in a hot stone bowl .
i love sitting at the bar and watching them create magic .
this is pretty much what i expected for the food being $ 5.00 .
everything was super white and shiny with marble tables ... so it kind of felt like i was in a washroom .
the bottled beer was nice and cold but my friend thought the tap beer was not nearly cold enough .
they have really nice dinner meal deals which was around $ 9 bucks per person .
i had chic francaise , great ! music and ambiance were old vegas and great .
i love this place .
their coffee is awesome and the atmosphere inside is great , in my opinion .
too bad no beer though .
beer and wine list is very interesting & fairly reasonable .
so they wanted me to pay $ 11 for three small chicken tacos .
dry chicken and over cooked food .
service was friendly and quick ! food was super good !
prices are pretty decent .
they were both very nice rooms , but i prefer the king suite because it was more spacious and included a terrace .
price was $ 15 which is not bad .
i enjoyed a great selection of oysters , steak tartare and seared scallops .
this location i would call below par at worst .
upon entering i could only notice the tacky decor and crap plastered along the walls .
or 2.5 it 's kind of confusing how the layout of the mall works out .
generally good quality and pretty fresh . great for lunch and very reasonably priced .
the wine list is great too .
we come here about twice a month and it 's great every time !
mens bathroom apparently was a nightmare ( took away a star ) vomit in sink , urine and feces on floor : / womens bathroom was fine .
the restaurant has an absurdly tacky interior . a shame , really .
the bartenders were very friendly .
but we come for the great drinks .
everyone enjoyed the dishes they ordered .
luckily , the staff is n't shady at all , so do n't worry about your order being compromised .
to compliment my meal i had some ice tea and a coors light that was on special for $ 2 !
most people probably eat the buffet which was reasonably priced at under $ 14 .
the mac and cheese was not anything special except that it had an egg on top ... . it kinda tasted like a velveeta mac with an egg on top to be honest .
love ! this place !
i am a huge fan of the ohio city area and like coming down here at least once a month as i am not that close to cleveland .
not bad , but they could definitely add some taps or bring in some bottled beer .
the art on the walls was really good ( and for sale with all of the money going to the artists ) .
food was just ok. i got the salmon and it was chewy and the sauce was so overpowering . grilled vegetables were pretty good .
what a great find !
the decor was done very nicely , but they ruined it with the lighting .
do n't miss out it is a great place !
the warm flour-less chocolate cake for dessert was great as well , not as amazing as terroni 's but still delish !
it was not too loud as in some places , but was very soothing .
as for price , i think it is very reasonable considering how much japanese sushi can be in new york ( $ 30-40 easily ) .
just do n't expect the transaction to be pleasant !
it 's one of my goto places for the dry noodle soup .
the drink menu is terrific , with sodas and fruit drinks that are beyond the expected .
the lighting is odd ... it is dim , but not the right kind of dim . it 's not warm lighting it is like fluorescent bulbs dimmed .
with a loud no , no toilets .
welcome to pittsburgh in the morning .
great food and great service . kid friendly .
i do n't normally like fried chicken but this chicken was cooked really well and was not overcooked or dry .
on a different note , the men 's bathroom was very messy and there was no soap or paper towels anywhere .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
we had their unique sorbet mimosa which was strong and sweet !
the drinks were bomb ! unique mix of hard alcohol and shot of beer recommended by the bartender !
the food was good and i love their crust .
my server , stormy , was delightful and friendly , and served up a mean margarita for me .
they had great drink specials .
there cheese steak is also very good .
and did i mention that the margarita was very weak ? i think the bartender forgot the tequila .
try the chicken pepper masala and kashmiri chicken .. you will love it
the ambiance is nice too .
reasonably priced also . good value .
came here with a friend for a late dinner before heading out for the night .
the food and drinks are quite reasonably priced , and it 's a decent neighbourhood pub .
the ugly : the noodles were terrible .
as a side note : the catered meal i previously tried was family-style chicken with potatoes and veggies , i believe .
tried the cheese and garlic ramen , but did not like it one bit . good but overpriced gyoza .
the seating area was okay , nothing really nice .
highly recommended if you 're in the area and need a quick bite that 's not really fast food .
the curry and pad thai is ... not what i 'm used to , but not bad as long as you expect something new . however , the service could not be better .
overall the buffet was boring and lame . not a great selection and while nothing i had tasted bad , it was n't great either .
there 's always a beer special that 's decent and pretty cheap too .
great decor inside and out .
it should be a full friggen plate . also it 's cold .
rooms : tired looking , stale decor , old school style , no ipod docks , big fat fax machine , difficult to locate lighting , difficult to locate power outlets , no wifi , mediocre bathroom amenities .
the service was crap and they charged us for things we asked for but they never delivered .
decent food , overpriced .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
the decor is a little tired , hole in the wall - but not horribly off putting .
the only thing i liked was my husband 's strawberry margarita , which had booze in it , compared to my non alcoholic version ( i 'm pregnant ) .
no alcohol this trip , but they do have a full bar , with 5 beers in tap .
go ahead and make sure to come out here for a nice brunch .
for the money , a great place to pick up a fresh pizza for a family dinner or a casual night with friends .
the happy hour is great and their sake cocktails are really tasty .
last time i went the chicken was overcooked and dry .
incredible food and drinks .
we had martinis and they were extremely well made .
the total of this was $ 72 .
we are so happy to finally have the iconic canter 's deli in our neighborhood .
the service was very good and the drinks were delish ( try a raspberry mojito - mmm ) .
unless you count dust on the tables as decor . only upsides ?
this week i went in there and the floors were clean , and i got exemplary service .
no alcohol this trip , but they do have a full bar , with 5 beers in tap .
great experience . two of us went in for apps and a beverage .
this review is only for drinks and dessert . great drinks , great wine list , aaaamazing desserts .
so happy they added good salads to the menu and an actual wine list ( including rose ! )
it looks so silly .
my favorite thing was the risotto .
we had the steak special which comes with a veggie side , potato , a salad , bread and a beer .
and of course , i 've tried the taro and black sesame soft serve and it 's very good .
we got the papaya salad which was really bland and clearly had n't been made with fish sauce .
great food . reasonable prices .
i kind of figured from all the annoyingly kitschy signs and decorations all over the place .
the decor inside was cute as well - i took my meal home to eat but there is a small bar seating area available if you 'd like to stay .
men 's room was not even close to clean with tissues in shoved in all facilities and no paper towels or hand dryers and no hand soap .
cocktails are delicious , they were also able to make virgin cocktails for the ones not drinking which tasted amazing !
the service is superb and the attention they will give you . of course the tipping 20 % is appropriate for this place as they will not ignore you .
the do serve eggs but can make pretty much all of the items with tofu instead .
my friend enjoyed a nice glass of chianti with her meal and they have a pretty good wine selection .
all in all such a great place to try something new with friends . will eat again soon .
i go here pretty often .
when i was there , they had 2 different alcoholic slushy drinks , and i ordered one of those and it was phenomenal .
ambience is what you pay for here - trendy vibes and crowd , good music .
there 's no hard liquor , just beer and wine .
judy even specifically asked for them to bring out the sprinkles and brought them all the way to our table for my god daughters ice cream just to make her happy despite us even requesting them .
we also has the crab puffs and amigo roll- everything was tasty and fresh ... and reasonably priced !
the wasabi sauce on the taco had the perfect kick and tied in every flavour .
i do n't understand what happened to this restaurant because they used to have decent food .
great restaurant , really great quantity for the price you pay .
my brother and i randomly came in one day to try out this place and we fell in love .
it is a great family restaurant to go to .
good prices and good food .
a little ghetto , but smart .
the lights were dimmed so not bright enough to read the menu with using your cell phone flash .
( not that there is anything wrong with generic butter chicken ! )
i 'm told it gets very , very loud inside when it is busy , so this would not be great for chatting , unless you sit outside .
our server was not friendly at all ... he never came to check on us while we were eating and when we told him the burgers were dry he did n't even apologize .
staff us as long friendly , attentive and fin .
no hot water or paper towels , dirty , and down a sketchy hallway .
the staff were very nice , helpful and knowledgeable .
the beef broccoli tasted a bit off and once again tasted bland to me .
the decor was very nice ( bonus points for not having the tables too close together ) and we enjoyed dining there .
the worst thing is the bathrooms , they have run 2 four foot fluorescent lights on each side of the bathroom mirrors that are bright and obnoxious .
it 's delicious , but not as salty as bojangles breading .
the pour was horrible and the beer was flat .
great service . comfortably atmosphere .
and they have some good beers for the pitcher not .
the lighting seemed to be pretty good , which is important to me .
the hostess was kind enough to ask us if we were ok. i had told her that we were sitting there for 10 minutes and nobody even acknowledged us and that i would rather go somewhere else .
i had to request a dish of butter to dip them in , and when they brought it the butter was cold and thick .
the food is just ok , and the price is not cheap .
huge portions , huge selection .
other than that , the food was really delicious ! it was a good sized portion .
the sauce was again perfectly balanced in flavors and very light .
for $ 19 per person , it 's a great value .
wait staff was friendly and very attentive .
the spicy beef noodle was a huge portion .
great cocktails , but no draft beer . need i say more ?
we had a four course dinner and each entree was timed perfectly and was delicious .
the moscow mule was good and was really refreshing . the peach jazz and king 's ginger tonic had a lot of alcohol and overwhelmed me a bit , but it 's good for the price .
extra star for the interesting decor and funny ass signs posted around the place .
it 's a good place to stop by for a quick bite to eat .
nice atmosphere with water and little bridges . good vibe .
i also got a cadillac margarita that tasted like they just lazily put the alcohol and margarita mix .
only thing is that the bathroom was pretty dirty & there was no toilet paper in there .
bathroom was pretty dirty , soap was out of dispenser and just thrown up on the sink .
i went to the hostess stand and was told the server will be right with us .
while there , the manager/owner took a call and refused to refund an order for a to go customer who was given the wrong order . he stated he could n't perform a refund to the credit card , which is a blatant lie , not to mention poor customer service .
cheap price and filling though !
the iced tea is good- large choice of drinks .
loads of fresh chicken on the grill and rotisserie .
the fried rice was a nice sized plate and the shrimp in this dish were cooked beautifully .
lastly the oysters and incredible and a pretty good wide variety of options too !
they seated our party of 5 at a table made for 4 so we were pretty uncomfortable to start ( we should have just left then ) . the waitress gave a few of our dishes to the wrong table so we had to wait for them to remake it .
the only knock is that there was no beer on tap ; bottle selection was good though .
the prices are very good to boot .
however the beer was cold , and they had smithwick 's on tap .
awesome gyros ! generous portions of meat .
i just do take out now but would be nice if i could meet friends there . would be great if they opened up that outdoor seating in this nice weather !
awesome decor that had a nice trendy industrial look , yet felt very comfortable .
i usually only spend about $ 10-15 dollars when i come .
i drank the tasteless overpriced drink and switched to beer .
it was a nice gesture , especially since the meals range from about 12 - 25 per plate .
both were fantastic , the wings edging just in front . cooked perfectly and the sauce was great .
unfortunately she neglected to tell the person who was taking care of me .
they have a great patio and the food was really good .
a little sad that the pork steam buns were pulled pork instead of pork belly , and i was given the wrong ramen ( which the bartender was willing to give me chili sauce to fix ) , and they charge for eggs like others have mentioned ... but they do n't mention it 's a cold hard boiled egg .
then the food came out and it was cold , not luke warm but cold .
their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers .
prices are too high .
popeyes is a classic . delicious fried spicy goodness .
the mocktail drink was a blueberry rosemary concoction that was very fresh and tasted like summer .
the prices were about average for what you might expect to pay for a decent meal here .
this is a great establishment with an awesome owner .
prices are good too .
to top it all off the walls were painted a really ugly color .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
aside from its decor , there 's not much memorable moments to comment about .
all of a sudden , this man ( medium height , shaved head i believe ) who worked there literally yelled at us for not waiting to be seated when we did n't know . he then accused us of not paying because we did not wait , it was ridiculous and literally ruined our meal .
the food is good , but nothing to be bouncing off the walls about .
only thing i did n't like about the room and the hallway was the decor .
the orange juice i ordered was also a monstrous glass , which was awesome .
the woman behind the counter was very nice and friendly and helpful as well .
authentic food , band , and atmosphere .
the decor is horrible , lol , but i do n't come here to look at walls .
i can eat in silence but the combination of the poor lighting is straight up awkward .
they often have live music and only a small to moderate size crowd , which is great for providing atmosphere without the waits and the cluster .
we did order some margaritas and again they were n't bad just your typical margarita .
i feel bad about giving poor rating but have to give out my first one-star on yelp because of the unacceptable rude service we received . do n't even want to elaborate the details .
how hard is it to get an order right when nobody else is in the store ?
there 's no hard liquor , just beer and wine .
we were lucky enough to be seated relatively close to the window on a very comfortable couch .
the ravioli was so disappointing .
i ordered the grilled tofu kabobs , unsure what i was in for and enjoyed the flavor combinations and grilled texture of the tofu .
we 're excited to have a new burger joint in the hood !
the bar and drinks looked like a decent selection but did n't drink that night .
too bad no beer though .
prices are very reasonable .
the lighting is pathetic .
it 's definitely a nice quiet location for business or a date .
food was tasty and lots of unique drinks including fresh juices .
the food itself was decent , mediocre .
she thanked us sheepishly every time we said that our food did , in fact , taste good .
great food for an affordable price .
the decor was very nice , but cluttered with flags and other strange things .
yes , you 're eating in a strip mall , so it is n't very fancy and you 'll look pretty cruddy under the fluorescent lights ... but who cares ?
not sure why we waited because there were ample tables and it appeared that they were staffed for them .
now , i love wonton soup but unfortunately this version was n't nearly as good ( lacked wontons ) and cost $ 15 .
great value for under $ 50 for 2 people to have dinner
we came here for the valentine 's day special - four course meal , $ 55 per person .
beer selection was weak as well , and their bottle menu was inaccurate .
i recently visited for lunch and was surprised how awesome it was .
he was the only one up there , not sure where the other workers disappeared to .
i got a glass of some other kind of beer in a nasty glass .
for only $ 2 dollars a taco , it is well worth it .
love their rice as it is sticky and goes perfect with the dishes .
goes great with sparkling water or a beer .
you can get a baked potato instead but it costs $ 6 for that ... lame .
we sat outside in the garden and it was beautiful on a nice night .
my main course was the pork belly chop that that was cooked and seasoned perfectly .
the servings were normal sized split in two .
the rice was tasteless , patty had almost no meat in it , chicken was just aight . overpriced ... meh ... not the best
while we did not drink any booze , they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers , wine , and specialty cocktails .
only a couple of things that bothered me .
the lighting inside is very dim , to the point of almost using my cell phone light to read the menu .
the beer menu was pretty weak . they did n't have much on tap and the bottle selection was just as poor .
the food is good . the prices are reasonable .
pretty good service except there 's this really creepy dishwasher who is always staring ... . really creepy .
terrible service and poor pricing . how does it cost $ .60 less to get the strips without a side and a drink .
ambiance is nice , not too loud , but definitely happening .
the mint infused tea and lemonade were delicious and our server was very attentive but seemed very shy and unsure of the menu .
the reviews seemed mostly positive , the location was very nice , and i enjoyed the setting as there are windows surrounding 50 % of the wall space with a nice outdoor patio area .
the waiter was cool and gave us a sample of the kale tonic , which was also more citrus-y .
i ca n't hold too much against the place , but watching what had to be the most awkward romantic failures was somewhere between unbearable and utterly amusing .
great food . always on point and the staff is full of wonderful personality .
they still did n't have anything on draft but a good bottle selection .
the dough and the cheese were extraordinary !
the employees are always friendly and give good service .
the bathroom was nice , but the advertisements in the mirror were tacky .
the wine was good .
sadly , i was majorly disappointed .
it is nice and open with a nice , chill atmosphere .
this place has a really trendy and hip vibe .
the decor is awesome , it will be so cozy and cute in the winter months with all the stone , old barn beams , and the giant stone fireplace . very picturesque .
favorite place to eat in surprise . sweet potato fries to die for , oh and plantains yum yum .
good snacky food for an affordable price .
oh and they make great drinks too .
i really liked this establishment !
prices are very fair in fact very reasonable .
my friends that ordered traditional breakfast items said the food tasted oily .
great drink specials . great drinks .
the thin crust pizza done in super hot ovens is on point and when it comes out it is still bubbling ... careful you can burn your mouth .
the food is original and delicious ( i had the grilled cheese - a less exciting options i 'll admit - which was phenomenal ) .
they introduced the blackberry lemonade which is delicious and comes in a large cup .
he also offered us chilled limoncello , which they made from scratch , positively magnificent - frozen shot glasses to keep it ice cold , it did not hit the palate as strong as you might expect , the cold subdued the alcohol and allowed you to taste the exquisite sweet lemon taste that is often masked by the alcohol .
beautiful flower arrangements and fun seating , though the food was okay -- not bad for a touristy place .
now the eggrolls looked pretty inviting but sadly , they fell short of taste .
someone took my order 15 mins ago and i 'm still sitting in my car waiting for someone to acknowledge me ... but at least the guy in the window can slide along the kitchen floor ... .he 's pretty excited about it .
one final note , the light switch for the bathroom is on the outside wall , behind a gray electrical box , just follow the black arrow .
dinner prices are reasonable .
i asked the owner why and he said it was because he would have to have a `` full staff '' how cheap . a vegan restaurant that does not care about the environment .
good retro dining bar !
prices are really reasonable and the food is pretty good .
they have a full bar , a nice draft list , and an array of bottled and canned beers .
bathroom was disgusting . looked like someone puked in the sink , urinal and on the floor .
it has awesome appetizers and great mixed drinks , wine , and craft beer .
the wine list is impressive ( i would recommend the rosé ) .
the food & drink the drink was exceptional .
i enjoyed my dinner with the cucumber cooler , which is a mojito with a cucumber twist . delicious and refreshing !
the food is terrific and the price has n't change since i started coming here in 2008. mongolian beef , ribs , pork fried rice and all their appatizers are my favorites .
the squash fritters and fresh rolls were tasty , too . highly recommended !
i 'd definitely recommend getting the full flight , so you get sorbet , the dessert , and a wine pairing .
plenty of meat , nice chewy bread , and a healthy ( or not ) helping of cheese on each . the fries were kind of mushy , but they served their purpose .
( free shots of espresso , free flavors , half off , etc ) .
reasonable prices for a decent lunch .
the waitresses were confused about who had ordered what .
when the lady , who i can only assume was the manager , arrived at our table she did n't introduce herself or ask how she could help .
ramen was great , but the manager was rude to the people making the guests feel welcomed .
it could look nicer if the lights were n't so harsh .
oh yeah , love the choices of different onions
had a great date at the strip view cafe .
i did not pay $ 119 plus dollars to get bad service .
- although they only had three beers on tap , at least they were good craft beer choices .
the lighting makes it very unappetizing . the `` waiters ? ''
bill came out to 60 so we only paid 35 after tips which is not bad .
the decor was extremely tacky but it allowed the food to be the real star .
i love this place .
unfortunately , no bud light lime on tap so we just drank regular beer .
first off , the space is huge . the decor is beautiful and the atmosphere is fantastic , but the cavernous space is so big that most of it goes to waste ( i 've never once seen any activity in the open tortilla kitchen ; the place just gave up on making fresh tortillas .
they have a nice decoration that reminds of new orleans .
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
in here words `` well i 'm sorry you feel that way '' and she let us walk out pissed off and hungry .
good value . very good tasting food at an affordable price .
we ordered ahi tuna for an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious .
bottom line 4 star not 5 because of the loud atmosphere and the poor lighting .
we were only interested in a cocktail and snack , not a full meal .
i enjoyed the chicken , which was very juicy and crispy .
the pizza was quite good .
looks like the prices are not raised and so it 's a good option .
took a long time for food to arrive and when mentioned to staff they pretty much called me a liar .
amazing place , would love to go if possible .
the breading was perfect and the fish was not over or under cooked .
the only thing i do n't like as much is the décor ( except the hanging lights ) .
the tzatziki also was n't too great .
portions are huge . the nachos is pretty good too .
it has a great happy hour and beautiful view . it can get crowded , but the staff is friendly .
we ordered a round of drinks first , which took 20 minutes to get . our food took over an hour and came out cold .
they also have great sangria , which you can order by the cup or pitcher .
as i was walking to the door , i could n't help but notice the extreme buildup of dust and black grime on the lighting fixtures and vents .
patio dining with fire pit is a great feature .
the decor is pleasant but the darkness in the restaurant ( 7:30pm ) , reading the menu requires night vision goggles and makes the decor nearly invisible to appreciate .
if you like good food stay away . if `` fake it until you make it '' works for you this place would be number one .
the prices are reasonable .
a great restaurant with great atmosphere , helpful and attentive staff , and delicious drinks ; their michelada ( clamato , beer , and lime juice ) is absolutely freakin incredible .
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
its a very nice spacious dinning space and the grounds are beautiful , with plenty of parking .
loud ass hell , laughing off the top of their lungs , and just hanging out in large numbers blocking walkways .
only complaint would be about the service.. we had to wait quite a while for water to be refilled even though the place is tiny and was n't full .
the concept and decor is nice .
the wine list is great and not too intimidating .
food was average service by our waiter was poor . the manager came by and did great .
like most good sushi joints it 's a little pricey , about $ 75 for two .
oh and the bathrooms are cool looking .
i also got the house sweet peppers , and instantly wished i got the house peppers , there were about 3-4 bell pepper strips on the sandwich not quite what i expected and they did n't taste any different than if i bought some bell peppers at home , sauteed them and slapped them on a sandwich .
i mean , my mouth starts watering as soon as i see it - with a nice creaminess and a some fresh dill .
these servers looked dumpy and just bizarre styling !
i do n't like having sloped walls or windows because it makes me feel claustrophobic .
the pancakes were also really good ! very hot and fluffy .
the prices are great as well .
the sauce has a good amount of garlic in it , and herbs , and it is wonderful beyond words .
crap all over the floor , the restroom ( women 's ) was disgusting , really guys ?
beer selection was ok , food was ok , service was ok ( one of the draft beers the server was unsure of , i think there were only 4 on the list .
it was delicious and decently priced .
my salad was bitter and lots of brown lettuce and it was not good at all .
too bad you have to wait over 20 minutes to get your food .
drink some sake & enjoy a unique & delicious dining experience .
i also got a cadillac margarita that tasted like they just lazily put the alcohol and margarita mix .
chicken cheese crisp is the best in town . good deal .
great drink ( live and let bee ) , yum ! desserts .
very clean nice waitress .
great value , superb flavors in the meat .
a definite winner when you get tired of paying 100 dollars for a steak and escargot on the strip .
i highly recommend the giant stuffed quesadilla .
it 's got a weird vibe ... maybe because the decor is from another era but it 's kind of interesting , too ?
i wo n't go into detail on the atmosphere it was a crowded saturday night but it was clean and had a cottage in the woods type decor .
you wo n't be sorry .
the workers were nice i guess , the food wasnt very good . everything about the place just seemed so damn old the wallpaper plates , ceiling , and decor .
chicken was dry and no flavor .
i do n't mind paying for good food but expensive for terrible food ?
it was replaced with another draft beer that was n't that great either .
the food is fantastic ... . had the platter . brisket is great and especially with all the homemade sauces .
trendy , clean , black motif , big tv playing cool stuff , neon signs with all the specials .
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
just tried porkopolis for the first time and was fortunate enough to meet the man himself , brady !
very poor service we spoke to the manager and they admitted they forgot order . no wonder the server was as bad as he was .
ramen had a more chewy consistency but not bad at all .
he has personally given me nasty and snide comments on a consistent basis .
only weird thing is the ridiculously short doors in the women 's bathroom so people can see you pee . pro tip : there 's a stand a lone handicap bathroom , use that instead .
i am all for reusing perfectly usable furniture but just rolling some interior house paint over it does n't really appeal to me .
we had the friday special , a couscous with beef -- hearty portion with plenty of carrots , potatoes and squash .
great drinks as well .
very nice atmosphere & decor .
good atmosphere and i highly recommend this place .
a very diverse crew working which was amazing to see .
also the prices are quite steep . but great pizza !
good quality , clean and good service however i do think some items are not worth the price tag . ie uni sushi for 18 a piece
also really nice patio when the weather is nice .
the mediocre food is n't worth the high prices they want for it .
very good mixed greens with a tasty dressing .
restaurant is very clean . staff is very friendly .
the prices are pretty darn fair , and you get a decent amount of food as well .
i love this place and go there anytime i get a chance or my cholesterol level allows !
good food , cheap prices .
will return everyday while i 'm in vegas !
unusual for phoenix this summer yes ... herbal passion fruit tea was delicious and that and water were refilled frequently .
and the frozen margarita did n't seem to have hardly any tequila .
picnic tables outside are great as long as it 's not too hot .
i like that it is located pretty close to my home and that it 's open 24 hours because i 'm usually getting off pretty late every night .
seems locals gather here , friendly , nice wine glasses and drinkable wine .
reasonably priced as well . also clean .
our waitress was very pleasant , knowledgeable , and attentive .
food is good . prices are decent .
wth is the cloyingly sweet , alarmingly orange sauce that they use for their butter chicken ? butter chicken should be creamy not sweet and yellowish not tangerine orange .
the antique ( read : junk ) shop provides a unique ambiance and plenty of things to talk about during the meal .
the food is decent nice proportions ok priced .
they have servers yet still make you order from the front and then have a seat . the service was ok , so i have no idea why they have servers if they make you get your own drinks .
these servers looked dumpy and just bizarre styling !
for my entree , i ordered the chicken piccata and it was one of the best versions that i 've ever had !
anyway the prices are reasonable , the food was mostly great .
our waiter aj was amazing . he should get 5+ stars he was friendly , had great recommendations and was very attentive to our needs .
secret tip : each entree has a wine listed to pair with your meal to experience the full effect . cheers !
really delicious and fair price .
i was underwhelmed with the decor and dirty windows besides all of that lets talk about the food .
it is also very cheap , under $ 8
they will charge you for the most expensive sub for a special order .
who does n't love paying $ 4 for a beer ?
my dining companion had a caprese salad as well ( we could have shared one salad with a main course but this dish is one of my favourites so i like to have my own ) .
the congee itself was fine but not spectacular enough to justify the price of $ 17+ .
clearly if i 'm up in this area again , i will return and give them another shot , but this time was disappointing .
the management seemed uninterested in whether tables were actually happy .
prices are very reasonable .
the food is decent and reasonably priced .
the place is very clean and well kept .
i had the fettuccine alfredo , and it was in all honesty an average meal of fettuccine , was n't too impressed with it .
share plates make dinner intimate - or a party . the wine selection is tough to beat , particularly the wines by the glass .
this place is really , really a vodka bar and as such they only have one beer available ( which my fiancé said was good ) and all the cocktails are vodka based .
i love the relaxing , friendly environment .
i understand prices in vegas and especially certain hotels but for the portions and quality i would not go there and pay those prices again .
lots of conversations , cell phone and in person , filled the air , with nothing to absorb all of the sound .
outstanding pizza & wood roasted vegetable antipasto is amazing . worth the wait for incredibly fresh and well prepared pizza .
but every dish has been great . tom yum is a must .
the ambiance is really nice too .
we got a bottle of wine , it was good wine !
the lighting is horrible ; could not read the menu .
the low lighting and modern decor were very nice .
it seemed just like chicken .
such a cute little cafe in old montreal .
good food . staff is attentive and always telling me about new items and specials .
menu is priced fairly .
but it 's tasty , reasonably priced , and friendly .
the server kept my water glass full ( darn all that soy sauce ! )
the prices are good .
across the board , each dish was boring and bland . and each dish was - meh .
the burger i have to admit was good but something about a soggy disintegrating bun turns off my appetite .
the breads come out hot , fresh , and begging to be smothered with butter .
others ordered tidbits ( a meat dish ) and i ordered the steak tartar with homemade cheese appetizer and was very pleased .
it was very delicious and reasonably priced .
fake decor elements do n't make ambiance ( to me , anyway ) .
tasty , but once again cold , the cheese was not melted on either one of ours .
loved the food ! the place was clean and oscar and david will take great care of you .
presentation is also amazing .
good bar for food and drinks .
they throw in a bunch of sides but it 's just sort of an overload of bread and starch ( especially the overkill hashbrowns ) hushpuppies are decent , do n't really care for coleslaw much and the roll is nothing special .
head on over to salty to check out happy hour , just stick with the chips and salsa , a cold beer and maybe a quesadilla .
the beer menu was pretty weak . they did n't have much on tap and the bottle selection was just as poor .
prices are very reasonable .
i love their food ! their food is always fresh , plentiful and delicious .
only concern is that the bathroom looks a little rundown .
the food is great . the manager is awful .
the pancakes were excellent , so was the bacon . the shake was disgusting and had the texture of spit up .
the wine selection was great too !
we were extremely pleased with our dining experience and hope to return during our time in phoenix .
it was n't very expensive either , 12 to 16 a meal .
we ordered the chicken presto pesto ( the bomb ! ) , the margherita pizza and the going greek salad , everything was fantastic !
the restaurant was nice and clean inside .
i ordered another drink as the beer flight was hardly anything .
our server brooke was fantastic and attentive , and took great care of us .
room was nice , but expected more . hallway was dirty , bathroom ceiling had hair stuck to it , ( gross ) , no coffee maker or refrigerator .
my friend 's steak was cold , my hamburger was ok , but my husbands po something sandwich was amazing , wowwwww , i should have asked for that one instead .
we plan to return but , jenni please turn down the garish annoying overhead lighting !
good selection of beer , wine ... not at all .
server was friendly and attentive .
nothing fancy , cheery interior , decent food ... four stars .
to top it off , the total bill came to $ 28 which felt like a steal !
flavorless , cold and some are rotten .
the beers were ok , nothing special .
they were all fire . especially the watermelon drink .
the food is fantastic and all homemade .
my only concern for the room was that all the lighting were programmed in uniform so if you were to turn on the lights in the bathroom , the lights in the rest of the room would light up as well .
the actual soup itself was pretty good and i preferred it over the cream soup i also tried . the portion of the pasta was about average and the sauce used was not very good .
the burrito was pretty big , and for the most part was basically all ground beef ( aside from the shredded carrot of course , which was n't bad to be honest . ) it was good , just kind of bland i guess .
it smelled funny and was inedible so it went down the garbage chute .
i liked the bathroom layout for some odd reason .
we had to wait at the front for about 10 minutes before being seated , and once seated we noticed that a lot of the plates , sauce trays , and silverware were dirty .
as if i had paid $ 25.00 for a great value box pizza .
great food and low price .
the drinks and food are reasonably priced .
none of the stuff has taste and it was bad tasting and not authentic .
however , the beer was good . they poured a good beer .
the quality was pretty good but you can do better elsewhere for the price .
pretty much $ 30 down the drain .
also , they have a great dining specials , one of which includes oysters and infused vodka shots !
luckily , they opened one out here and ive been very happy .
the furniture here was outdated and not to fit the theme , but just nothing aesthetically pleasing .
we always give 20 % tip but today was only 10 % thanks to our waiters attitude throwing my money on the table without a word .
they had some great drinks on draft that tasted like beer .
happy hour drink prices to die for !
with the talk ceilings it was very loud , the manager said they were going to install curtains to help absorb some of the echoes . i really think they need to install some sound absorbing foam tiles on the ceiling .
it also comes with a drink ( free refills ) and we chose lime ginger ale , which we recommend .
what i got was tasteless rice with bland dry chicken and zero veggies whatsoever .
first let 's start with the sweet tea . tea perfect .
even things which `` you have to order specially cause they arent on the menu . ''
it was also kind of strange that our sushi dishes did not come with any ginger and wasabi .
they have only a few beers on tap , a pretty good choice of bottled beer and a basic bar stock .
my parents always go there for date nights on friday ! and i always crash date night and invite myself for great food and tasty margaritas : )
other than that , a great place to grab tacos with friends !
had a great quick meal and a drink with some friends , got the colorado chili and a scotch ! our server jason was super friendly , fast and personable !
it 's fresh and light yet super filling .
only weird thing is the ridiculously short doors in the women 's bathroom so people can see you pee . pro tip : there 's a stand a lone handicap bathroom , use that instead .
there seemed to be a question about where they where going to seat us once we got there , but they where able to make a high top table work .
it was humongous and sooo good .
it was a small and cozy place .
excited to try a new vietnamese hot dish , this is what i got : a warm plate of sticky noodles , topped with mere samples of almost raw vegetables , soaked in a watery sauce that splattered all over my face and shirt .
the ugly : some creepy looking customers in this place .
feel a bit silly .
simply amazing ! i love this spot .
what a cool spot !
it is $ 8 and huge . it is delicious .
the decor is quite modern . the staff are friendly and the prices are fair ( $ 10/person will get you a good meal ) .
the drink selection was so lame .
i got the yuzu hi to drink and it was just tart and fruity enough without being overwhelming .
pretty pricey for 2 people $ 62 but they have a big selection of food to offer .
i think the total tab was $ 70 ... not too bad , seeing as we had 3 small margaritas each , plus food .
this place has been around for a very very long time .
the bread is amazing and all of the sauces were actually delicious . can really taste the quality and well worth the value .
as for the drinks : -after all , the bar was just calling out to me and although i had hoped to see more beers on tap , unfortunately , a majority of their beer list was bottled .
but today the chicken korma was dry ( not really curry at all ) , the chips were over cooked , the burger was dry , and the yorkshire pudding was atrocious .
happy hour pricing ca n't be beat with the quality .
normally i get everything broiled .
generally happy and helpful staff , usually quick service .
the only gripe that i have is the pricing for a single taco , about $ 5 .
the prices are very reasonable .
we ordered the yard size pina colada and strawberry daiquiri . both of them were great !
it 's pretty cool ( i know , weird to write a review about restrooms ) because it looks like a spaceship inside .
then there was a roof leak at the table behind us and it all felt kind of awkward .
prices were very reasonable too .
highly recommend this place .
not especially crowded . fast & attentive service .
this place is the real deal . authentic , good and reasonably priced for vegas .
highly recommend for out of towners .
juicy and large pieces of chicken were super tasty ! waffle and fries were also really good .
our waiter was great and super attentive , and the half priced bottle of wine on sundays was great !
dana was one of the sweetest waitresses ever . so polite and attentive .
the kung pao chicken was greasy , lukewarm and had very little seasoning .
price is good too .
the pour was horrible and the beer was flat .
expensive for the taste .
not a bad bar .
food is just ok. it 's approximately 10 $ for bouncing castles .
great burgers , friendly staff in an intimate space .
i ca n't say enough good things about this place ! they staff is always so friendly and willing to let you try things !
i ca n't pinpoint it , unless it 's just that hotel bars swarmed with people wearing name badges are low key depressing .
we also had a pitcher ( or two ) of the rita rita which was nice and fresh tasting .
great place for a decent lunch for a reasonable price . they have lunch specials .
the drinks were a bit on the syrupy side but a minor gripe to an otherwise fantastic meal .
it looked good , but had zero flavor .
they had a great wine list and the service was good .
something a little cozier would be nice .
the wine is all reasonably priced .
combined with a couple of waters , the total for all the food was $ 60 .
neither of us could stomach the food enough to finish the entire dish .
this place is awesome !
the prices were reasonable and moderate .
we came here for appetizer and drinks and their pink lemonade is amazing !
weird lighting , weird colors and no meat to be found .
the restaurant looks great , and the location is perfect for the area .
and one more thing i do n't like about this place , is their over the top religious decoration , fake flowers and flashing lights .
it was great and about $ 40-50 per person .
the women 's room was pretty nasty , and one of the toilets was non-functional .
the orange chicken had a great orange flavor . the ginger chicken was also very good - love the tang of the ginger .
my fiance and i had congee and hot soy milk plus three dishes on the side for only 20 bucks after everything , and all dishes are very tasty , just love this place !
it 's sort of gothic and kind of trendy , but mainly just weird .
it took them only about 5 minutes to get the food ready but i would 've rather had it come out in 7 minutes and be hot .
the jalapeño hummus was brilliant and they have delicious and authentic yellow basmati rice . the lemon soup was rich and spicy .
prices are pretty reasonable for the portions and quality .
in their defense , the bottled beer was good .
every table was dirty , the floor was disgusting with trash and food everywhere , and the men 's toilet was overflowing all over the floor .
the only thing lacking is the interior decorating .
burgers are good , everything else tastes like they dropped a pound of salt on it . what happened ?
the noodles were ok but sauce & meatballs were pretty good .
i started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila .
both were delightful . dinner : i had the fish and chips which was super yummy .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
one guy had to leave the craps table every time the dice were thrown since he thought seeing them thrown was bad luck .
food was just ok ( frites were really not very good at all and almost a long wife potato chip - was n't just a bad bath but the style of cut ) .
he is a testament to wonderful service .
this place is pretty uninspiring . i feel like you can make anything edible with the magic buffalo sauce - but this was still pretty lame .
food was amazing . very spicy .
again my husband liked this asian restaurant better than i did . it was little too bland for me .
they offer a nice patio outside as well as plenty of dining inside .
loved the cute ambiance .
the wine is fabulous .
the wings were great as usual , but my fries were cold and the bacon on my burger was nearly raw and cold .
the cornbread they serve before your meal is delicious .
this is absolutely unacceptable .
the spicy tuna roll was $ 4.95 during happy hour which is reasonable , but was regularly priced as $ 6.75 . still a great restaurant though !
the service and friendliness here is the best around . you will be very satisfied by coming here : )
when we arrived though on saturday morning at 11:45am , they said the wait would be 1hour and 40 mins . ridiculous .
food prices are pretty decent too !
the `` og '' margarita was n't bad in flavor , but did n't have any indication that any tequila was in it .
wait time wise , it could be quicker as 45 minutes for desserts is not okay in my books .
the rice was horrible tasted like it was straight from a box .
i am happy that i stopped here before leaving though .
the wait staff was very friendly and helpful .
i was disappointed they did n't offer any beer on draft .
great food , great hospitality , great happy hour . excellent marg for only $ 3 ( happy hour ) made by keith .
the staff is very friendly and always accommodating .
decent prices for the quality of food given .
the sushi was horrible , i ordered an avocado roll and it was disgusting . i had to pick out all the avocado because it was nasty and old .
prices are reasonable as well .
does n't need to be fancy just the worn out booths were very uncomfortable .
it is delicious ! they have these sweet potato chips ... good lord these are good ! they are salty and they melt in your mouth !
i found my first experience with the unwich to be a delightful treat .
stopped by one night to have some sake with the so and was happy to find their hh menu .
while the food was served quickly , the rice was lukewarm , the chow fun noodle dish was bland and the rice noodles did not seem fresh .
instead of having you wait in line , they 're happy to have you sit and play $ 20 of video poker , and now your buffet is $ 70 instead of $ 50 .
he 's great and makes good conversation as well as always making great recommendations .
the vesuvio potatoes and the sauce are great and the chicken breasts are moist and flavorful .
for dessert i had something good but i dont remember since i had a lychee martini & couple of cosmopolitans : )
mind you we had some delicious drinks .
well priced , good quality and serving size .
very good as usual ! the curry chicken is awesome !
the staff is young , hip and super friendly , they make sure that your meal is perfect .
the service was very friendly , the music on the patio was so loud that it was hard to have a conversation .
had high hopes based on reviews - tomatoes were tasteless and pasta tastes like something you 'd expect to have at a cage aux sports ... gnocchi out of a can and tortellini dry .
our server mallory was perfectly attentive and had excellent product knowledge .
all of the meat is really delicious including the spicy sausage , thick cut bacon , and pulled pork . tender enough to cut with your fork , the pork chop is really the star of the show .
i love this place and have been coming here for years .
when we asked about the delay , we were told it was because we had a `` late seating '' and there was nothing they could do . there was no apology , and none of the staff seemed to care that we were unhappy .
good food and drink .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
the chicken was a bit dry and not much smoke flavor .
expensive - burger is bland , no flavor .
almost forgot about my terrible coronarita ... cheap margarita mix in a normal drinking glass with a corona sticking out .
delicious breakfasts , burgers , salads , and soups , too .
when it is almost $ 40 for breakfast for three people it better be damn good .
the pricing is not expensive when taking portion into consideration .
loud , mostly bad , rock music blared ( i guess in keeping with the gogo theme ? )
good food , great price .
kim and elizabeth hit it out of the park again , took my family to dinner the other night and had an incredible time . the service was top notch and the food was incredible .
i do n't drink beer , but my friends do and they said their beers were just ok , nothing spectacular .
their prices reasonable for the quality too .
the beer list was disappointing .
be sure to check out the always changing art for sale adorning the walls .
huge portion of lobster bisque . delicious with huge chunks of lobster .
this place was awesome .
5 stars this time around for the amazing service provided by sou !
i told one of the two hostesses what had happened and how unhappy i was about it .
beer selection was good , but a gastropub should have unique vessels for drinks . cider in a guinness pint glass is just ... .wrong .
the prices are a little high , however my rule in life is you get what you pay for .
ordered the kung pao chicken and it was unlike any kung pao i have had in scores of chinese restaurants . there was no sauce or vegetables , just rather dry pieces of chicken put on a bed of rice along with a overly generous amount of peanuts which only added to the dryness .
the room is very well decorated , pleasant smelling , and very spacious . the beds are comfortable , bathrooms are modern , and the balcony was nice .
we love going to the arizona biltmore , whether to eat or enjoy the patio off of the wright bar .
if i wanted a soggy quesadilla with only half the cheese melted i would have made it in my microwave .
it 's worth mentioning that they have a room upstairs , too , that is far more relaxed - they do a tv dinner night on thursdays .
we did n't drink , but it looked like they had 32 different beers on tap .
the food was cooked perfect and the service was good . i enjoyed the taste seasoned just right .
prices are reasonable , but a little pricier at night than for lunch .
pretty good inexpensive place .
got the vegan cupcake and bread . cupcake was hard as rock and tasted bad , and the bread sucked .
good wine list , not great .
i 'm willing to bet our margaritas had no tequila in them .
happy hour prices on margaritas were great , and the drinks were really tasty . had the happy hour appetizers .
the entire sandwich was disgusting .
very good . very well priced .
way too loud for a fairly small place .
we celebrated our wedding anniversary there november 5 and had some of the best service we 've had at a restaurant in years courtesy of dave .
simple yet so satisfying .
the white tuna was my favorite ! husband had the spicy crab roll and loved it .
been here for both business lunch and dinner . very nice staff and service .
it tasted like burnt wok with tasteless grilled chicken . no peanut sauce or peanuts anywhere .
it 's a great spot of a romantic dinner as the space has a nice dim , sexy ambience .
ambiance : clean restaurant with unique light fixtures and chic decor .
our pizzas were terrific , and the wine by the carafe was good and inexpensive .
i 've had nearly everything on the menu . my favorite items are the nachos with carnitas and the pozole .
they designed this restaurant to have an open kitchen so that it gives the place a modern diner feel , and because of that , you 're exposed to a strong greasy odor .
it 's also got a kind of jungle decor to it , plus all kinds of shiny mirrors and neon lights - quite tacky .
very reasonable prices . good food .
additionally , my friend had a drink made by the bartender off the menu that was so sweet it was almost undrinkable .
the atmosphere was great , the bar area was crowded because of some party , but the dining area was calm and spacious .
it must be noted that our busboy , leo , was amazing and would go get our waiter when he realized we were sitting and waiting for far too long .
the fun looking atmosphere and nice decor drew us in .
the cake is extremely moist ( ugh hate using that word but best way to describe ) and it comes poured with a vanilla bean sauce over it .
could n't drink but beer menu looked awesome too .
terrible service . waitress would come once every 30 mins making our experience 1.5 hrs long .
the broth had a nice , savory flavor with a slight tang to it .
margaritas had no alcohol in them yet they were the `` special '' of the night .
perfect spot for girls night out !
a decent amount of options for a reasonable price .
i was impressed that i had a coupon good for $ 2 off a purchase of $ 10 ( which is a lot of food for one person at tb ! )
price is cheap and the place is very clean .
many different food stations with tons of great choices . lots of deserts as well including gelato and macaroons .
negatives - the only negative i can think of is the lighting is a bit dull and dated .
great wine list too .
no good beers on tap or bottle , so i ordered water .
getting the drinks perfectly made and apps sampler was superb . paired with our specialty drinks it was a perfect gno !
i love the drinks here , strong !
seriously ... seriously ... when are the employees going to learn customer service ?
atmosphere was good roll 's were spectacular and twice baked potato was also very good .
i finally got the nerve to use my $ 10 off voucher -- i feel so bad about getting three meals including a beer for $ 12 .
there was live music , and they took requests , which provided a great atmosphere .
there was a positive vibe in the restaurant -- a consistent buzz of folks coming and going , pleasant conversations , lots of laughter .
the chairs are kind of weird ... all metal , but that 's to go with the theme i suppose .
it is n't cheap , but it is very good .
we ordered off a picture on a menu which looked like a giant mountain of meat - and it arrived looking exactly like it .
food was very good and surprisingly cheap .
the beef from the carving stations ( 3 varieties ) was really subpar -- tough and bland .
both sandwiches come with their own house made sauce , which is what really makes these sandwiches special .
lol i also had the sweet tea cocktail interesting !
she picked it up , read it out loud to everyone in the store , trying to prove her point , but started to lower her volume when she realized she was just proving my point .
we sat right by the window with the most fantastic view of the city .
and , it 's significantly cheaper .
it was just way too sweet .
the decor is cool and you can tell the place is trendy and filled with young professionals and locals .
the wait staff is really nice which is good . it is really really loud in here .
and sometimes the lighting makes me feel like i 'm being interrogated ( it 's a little dark and creepy ) .
the price is high for what your getting .
manager or owner came by to make sure everything perfect as well !
and the prices , totally reasonable .
first thing i noticed , live music ! instantly liked the place .
i got my beef pad thai and i only did 2 out of 5 spices but i was disappointed as i had no spice whatsoever .
just a little dry . meh .
morrissey 's itself is a nice place that is broken off into three sections : a dining room , a bar and an outdoor patio .
mandalay bay is a neat casino on the strip , very large with lots of options , but does n't have a lot in the way of tables for common games like blackjack .
the lighting is horrible ; could not read the menu .
the wine selection is excellent .
not classy , i know .
i mean people would like to talk to each other when they eat .
they also have burgers , salads , and hot dogs available to choose as well !
no draft beers which was a bummer , but still a decent selection of bottled beers .
the food is good , the prices are decent .
it 's a bit shady downstairs .
the slice is rather small for the price . in my opinion it is way too expensive .
onion rings were lukewarm but the burger had great flavor do n't bother if you are in a hurry
well , the $ 5 good house wine ranks highly as does the peach sangria and manhattan .
i drank the tasteless overpriced drink and switched to beer .
i 've been meaning to come here a bunch of times because , well ... you ca n't go wrong with cheap eats : d so after a day out with friends we wanted to grab a quick and cheap bite to eat before heading home .
especially the fountain view from the room that nothing can beat !
there is plenty of standing room and plenty of stair seating ( think high school gym bleachers ) .
overall , this theater is super friendly , clean , great food , good quality sound and picture , and very comfortable seats .
drink-wise , they had a nice selection of beer and excellent cocktail menu .
the decor in the place is cool and quirky ! service was excellent !
there is plenty of space to sit and catch up with friends , or get your laptop out and do some work ( free wifi , of course ) .
the bathroom was disgusting ! tissue all over the floor , lights out in some of the stalls , no hand soap , water all over the counter and garbage that was overflowing !
the bread , to die for ! nice lunch spot for pizza and a salad !
the drinks are strong and tasteful .
the meet is good and the breakers are filling with the right ratio of all of the toppings . the buns are the right size and there is no masking a mediocre burger with too much bread - everything is excellent .
good for the price !
there were only two other tables with people and they all had their food , so the waitress walked around with a confused look on her face .
i had changed places once already because the door was open which in turn caused it to be quite cold .
drank a strawberry smoothie to go with it on this warm day and it was super refreshing .
the staff is sexy . c bar is great place to meet people . the tower is awesome .
an overhead ceiling fan would have made the entire difference ... just a note .
prices are fair food is good , good is good .
plan to drop about $ 80- $ 100 per person to dine here , but you 'll come away very happy .
i prefer a sweeter type of bbq sauce versus a vinegary sauce so this is the perfect bbq place for me . i find their regular sauce with the perfect amount of sweetness .
the hostesses , bartenders and our server were all personable , happy go lucky and very good at their jobs .
i paid $ 40.00 per person for the worst buffet in las vegas . i was so disappointed and i 'm mad although its a weekday dinner still for $ 40.00 errr !
yep you guessed it , the bathroom floor . disgusting .
neither of my beers were apparently classified for happy hour .
we ordered the portobello risotto once but found it a touch bland .
we ordered 16 '' pizza , but they charged for 14 '' only and we did n't noticed it till end .
in and out with dinner for 4 including beers all around and a healthy tip for the good service at under $ 70 .
people told me it was expensive but it was only $ 22 for breakfast and i thought the price was completely fair .
one tiny sandwich is 10.00 $ a dish of disgusting macaroons are 2 $ each .
the lighting inside is very dim , to the point of almost using my cell phone light to read the menu .
on the menu , it said ' $ 5 for appertizer and beverage ' and when the bill came , it showed $ 5 for the appertizer and $ 5 for the drink and the total is $ 10 .
really cool spot . great for groups .
there was no waiting when we got here , which is good .
only complaint we had was that our server dropped off the food and then we never saw her again until she brought the bill .
ok one weird thing - in the men 's restroom is a urinal that looks like a horse trough .
great cocktails , but no draft beer . need i say more ?
i do n't love the look of the inside of the restaurant but the sushi is delicious and the prices are good . both times i have the avacado yam roll and loved it .
all rolls were delicious and the services was spectacular .
another cool aspect is that it 's byob !
great drink and affordable prices .
i immediately called to report and the receptionist was nasty and told me it was not possible and i can talk to manager tomorrow .
it is not cheap at $ 8.50 but it is soo good .
very friendly helpful staff and delicious food .
then we got doubled charged . luckily we caught it .
good prices for some good food .
he was very apologetic and checked in to make sure things were ok. i think if we had n't had the groupon , we would have not come here .
the lemonade was great too !
the food is good and the prices are very reasonable .
the location is perfect .
it was wonderful . my husband got the pepperoni pizza , and i had a side salad and some wings .
i had the `` light and stormy '' specialty cocktail , which honestly is the best cocktail i 've had in a very long time .
they do have some good wine by the bottle , but if you 're not interested in dropping $ $ $ $ you may be disappointed .
there 's not a ton of table , but there is a very long , shiny wood bar to sit at too .
my clients and i really enjoyed the bun salad with grilled pork .
he does not drink and had a light meal . the rest of us had cocktails and appetizers .
all of it was delicious .
but it definitely does not have that cute coffee shop vibe .
the beer glasses are n't cold .
however , something did n't sit right with two of us .
my husband had the veal piccata which was huge and my husband really liked it .
if the courses are on the more expensive end , i would expect the quality of service and food to match the price tag .
there service was polite and detailed but at a very casual speed .
unfortunately , i am not a craft beer drinker , but they did had a very large beer selection .
the food was pretty underwhelming as well .
so glad it 's a block from home !
i mean if you offer to stay late , do n't lack on the customer service nor quality of your products .
the price for dinner was reasonable at $ 30 a person .
wine i paid $ 24 for at 201 central was $ 22 at black chicken .
$ 55 a person for an insane variety of food is pretty good .
it is bad when the waiter had to tell the customer it is an original and not chocolate when placing down the eggette .
the prices are decent .
it 's so fluorescent bright in there it feels like you 're being interrogated .
i have been here twice now to be satisfied both times .
( free wine tastings on saturday afternoons , as well ! )
i had two beers and the beer was cold .
this sweetly renovated house turned restaurant has a distinctly retro feel in a very good way .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
we figured we would go sit at a table to get better service , bartender snapped at us and said we could n't transfer our tab so we gladly paid .
the food is only complimented by the yummy drinks . the waitress gave us great recommendations on drinks , the cocktail menu is pretty big .
beer is pretty cheap here , which is always a plus .
love this place , it 's in my top 5 list of places to frequent for good service experience . great food , great beer , and very friendly staff , make pasty house a hit with any friend or client i have ever met there .
honestly not impressed with it at all .
the steak was cooked and seasoned nicely ... very flavorful without being burning hot .
server was very friendly .
unfortunately , i am not a craft beer drinker , but they did had a very large beer selection .
the ambience is very nice .
prices are very good as well .
if they 're going to charge $ 13 for ham and eggs , a little extra punch in the presentation would be nice .
the wine ( chardonnay ) and the craft beer were excellent too !
there was no one in line behind me or ahead of me .
that 's pretty darned reasonable .
the wine list is not extensive but includes a nice loire rose that went well with our salads .
it was made with a fake meat and old vegetables .
we have tried almost every dish on the entire menu and everything is very very tasty ! plus the portion sizes are huuuuge !
love the street this burger shoppe is located on . the quaint street atmosphere extends inside the flip side .
had nachos which were surprisingly meh . bar tap choice was kind of limited , and they did n't have all on tap .
food was decent and reasonably priced .
my room had a weird stain on the carpet , dirt and a hair in the tub , lipstick or nail polish ( could n't tell which one ) on the bathroom counter , and one of the bathroom lights was askew .
i do n't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible .
they do n't carry the cool specialty drinks that burger lounge is popular for .
surely , they failed horrendously on this aspect .
marvelous place to go for happy hour .
the interior is beautiful , although the bench i sat on had a deep sag in the middle so it felt a little awkward .
any time a server delivers your margarita with , `` i 'm a terrible bartender because i like drinking too much .
the chicken was delicious , fell right off the bone and was really juicy and flavorful .
the view of the lake was great too .
authentic and delicious ! the best egg rolls and crab wontons i 've had .
amazing view of the strip that was enjoyed without being in the middle of the chaos and traffic .
the house-made chicken sausage patties were flavorful , and a perfect texture , and served with sweet potatoes and apples .
my boyfriend and i love this place !
very disappointing especially for $ 13 each .
prices are also just right .
burgers are only available in the lounge .
basmati rice - another amazing vehicle for the more gravy laden dishes .
atmosphere : visually , it 's a very nice restaurant .
the patio area is also covered which is nice but it is right in front of the parking lot so there is not a lot to look at .
glad he moved down to this location !
food is incredibly expensive for what you are given .
spend the extra $ 20 in ls voucher and go 1 block to il mulino , amazing food and excellent service .
i look around and the place is dimly lit ... not in a romantic way , mind you , but more in that , `` we just forgot to change the light bulbs '' depressing kind of way .
they also seemed to have a decent selection of wine and beer .
the lighting makes it very unappetizing . the `` waiters ? ''
a little ghetto , but smart .
there conversation was annoying ; 4 hipsters droning on and on about stupid stuff .
the wait staff is first class , friendly , helpful and attentive .
it was pretty much the same ingrediants as mine except for the chicken !
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
maybe this speaks more to my budget than anything else , but the sandwich is pretty small for the price ( over $ 10 after tax ) .
the ladies room was a disgrace . every stall was dirty , and the only stall with toilet paper was the one with the broken lock .
been looking for a good sushi place since we moved from california in september ... and we finally found it !
this is a `` cowboy '' themed restaurant with a very casual atmosphere and great views of the valley .
they are attentive , courteous and easy going . overall experience has made this spot a go to for good food and a nice time out .
for uptown it 's quick , reasonably priced , and of great quality !
then he ordered a pitcher of the sangria and we both agreed it was not as good or strong as the single glass .
the oreo frozen hot chocolate sounded so amazing , but boy , was i disappointed ... it tasted like a cup of syrup -- so sweet to the point that i threw it away without even making a dent in it .
one of the waiters came up to us so happily to tell us that they were serving a special valentine 's day drink for only 4 $ .
not a good place for wine , but about 30 draft beers .
she did n't get mine right -no apology on that or the orange rolls ( mistakes happen but at least be nice ) .
the service was very kind and friendly and after we called ahead they put some tables together for us so we could sit together .
prices are reasonable too .
my friend and i shared some good conversation ( along with that bottle of wine ) with each other as well as our dining neighbors who could not have been more delightful .
everyone i 've met on staff has been lovely !
though they are marginally more expensive than let 's say ... pizza pizza , i would gladly pay the premium .
the lunch special prices are very cheap ! and the food portion is very reasonable .
firstly , they 've made non-alcohol mojito for free since `` it 's just sprite with mint '' .
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
it does n't help to ask the person behind the counter because they 'll tell you it 's fine , even if they do n't know and then you end up sick anyway
the wine specials were a good price , i liked the pinot grigio .
great drinks and food !
a really good late night spot to grab really good food in a cozy atmosphere . it lost a star since i 'm sure it 's hard to staff at 3am and when it gets busy you tend to wait a while for both drinks and food but all in all a solid late night meal !
the bathroom was nice and big , but the lighting could be better , it was kind of dark .
the prices are ridiculously affordable and the sushi is good and more fresh than you would expect .
not a good place for wine , but about 30 draft beers .
my only gripe was the old fashioned i ordered for happy hour , it was way too strong and i opted to limit alcohol just there .
my wifes mongolian beef had some tough peppers but you usually do not eat them anyway .
once again the bun was dry and stale .
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
the staff have been really nice each visit .
i recommend this place highly .
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
the interior was a different story .
it 's neither good or bad , really . it 's much better than heating up a frozen lasagna , but not as good as a well-run maggiano 's ( yes , really ) .
i kind of get a snooty response to my ( picky ) order .
chad also made me 2 excellent drinks .
expensive for what it is .
the vegetables were bland and over steamed .
the prices are fair .
first , the good : the pork belly kimchi fried rice was fantastic !
the beer is cheap but the beer is also awful ; my boyfriend drinks a lot of beer and we went on national beer day .
margaritas were n't strong at all , they tasted like there was no alcohol in them .
way too expensive $ 10 for one sandwich . charging for hot peppers now .
no draft beer , but a decent choice of cans and bottles .
i love coming here .
the food was a little baffling ; for all of their `` boycott bland , '' i was a little befuddled as to how everything i tried was so ... bland .
overpriced , slow , and undercooked vegetables . the pasta was the only highlight .
$ 7.99 for 10 and i had 3-4 that were super small .
i do n't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine .
this is a vaguely nice place to sit on queen st , in an interesting neighborhood .
but there nothing braised about this chicken .
fish tacos are not good ; they used what looked to be a frozen fish stick .
food : everything was delicious . the coffee was hot and strong , the mimosas were tangy and refreshing .
well it was worst ! no flavor !
beer was good too and they even had drinks even if do n't drink beer .
it 's just a very laid-back , chill kind of spot to go to .
this restaurant is reasonably priced .
amazing food , great staff , thanks paul .
prices are reasonable and they offer lunch pricing as well .
the interior was clean and has amazing art work .
great space . great atmosphere .
the service here is always great and i love to watch the food preparation with the open layout providing a great kitchen view .
another note is that the artwork on the walls was depressing .
the staff is really happy and pleasant .
and then the fish on some of the pieces of sashmi was crunchy , tasted fishy , and very thin .
only said `` we 're extremely busy tonight . ''
came here for the 'best fish and chips in vegas valley ' ... and were let down ... the huge portion is really a bad thing , but the one huge piece i got was soggy and mushy in the middle by the time i got there . the chips were soggy and flavorless .
fantastic wine list , even by the glass ! and a classy menu , too .
drinks are reasonably priced too .
i also love the tropical iced tea and cheeky servers tees .
the coffee made the bill be more expensive , not only it was not good but they charge you $ 5.50 usd per coffee per person .
this review is for the casino and public display areas only .
the hot and sour soup was pretty bland and salty , no real heat to it .
after such a bad experience you would think they would also cover the one glass of wine and pint of beer but nope !
i got a peach fizzy cocktail drink that came in a bottle and it was delicious .
i even once tried a pretty awesome jalapeno margarita but honestly i would rather drink the beer .
it was so hard to ask even water .
not the cheapest , but not absurdly expensive either .
very filling and great prices .
beer selection was good , but a gastropub should have unique vessels for drinks . cider in a guinness pint glass is just ... .wrong .
not anything terrible , just bland , and boring .
its okay . lunch is cheap just for 5.99 dollars .
i not only had a delicious meal for 10 bucks ( which included a 6 oz .
i mean , they gave me a new chilled martini glass when mine was no longer cold because i was milking it ( it was a little strong ) .
i did n't take it out on him - he was just the messenger - but he was immediately apologetic , gave us 10 % off and a free side . he was doing the best he could .
ambiance : ( read below ) upscale yet tacky at the same time .
the brie was warm , the pastry moist yet flaky . another winner .
the atmosphere was great , except for the constant flickering of the track lighting ( it was quite distracting ) .
we stopped into buy a drink while out and about and the girl at the register was having a tuff time taking a phone order . while waiting to pay for our cups the owner chatted with us and eventually she gave us our drinks for free .
food was good and reasonably priced .
completely took over the place with our small but loud group of 4 !
they 're pretty fast , but they 'd probably save their workers and customers more time and efficiency if they just took the extra minute to go over the order again at the first window to avoid this problem .
some of the the food i got was cold .
beer was good too and they even had drinks even if do n't drink beer .
i feel like the cook tried to hide the pale greyish color of the meat by smothering it in sauce ... service was speedy and courteous .
$ 90 for a duck , or $ 130 for the deluxe edition .
they have a wonderful atmosphere in a great set in an old house in the historic area the feel is warm and inviting .
but the guy working there was super fast and efficient though so props to that !
i think the original is like $ 11 and going up from there .
the traditional hot sauces are great , the lemon pepper is fantastic , but their watermelon sauce is something that is special and unique .
overrated ! the taste is good i do not like their lay out an their customer service needs more training .
the dishes are authentic and delicious .
staff was friendly and sweet . pretty sure we 'll be coming back , especially knowing they make gf cupcakes here too .
i loved their raspberry iced tea , it was super good .
however , the beer was good . they poured a good beer .
they were out of corona so i had a beer on tap sorry do not remember name but it was good .
food is meh , prices are good though . i usually just come here for the cheap beer .
weird lighting , weird colors and no meat to be found .
it doesnt matter , but the dining room is kind of ugly .
the the dim lighting , grubby decor , and bland menu offer little reason to be nostalgic .
our server , jack , was very knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive .
the fries were pretty tasty , but it 's hard to screw up fries .
the waitress was rude and was n't listening to us when we said no lemon in the water .
we would most likely not make it a point to eat here again
good wine list and appetizers .
excellent service . good location .
the eggplant was bland and the bamboo tasted spoiled .
the fries was $ 17 and half a chicken is about $ 20 .
the only bad thing about this place is the sushi takes 30 to 40 minutes to come out . i ended up staying here for 2 and half hours because the food took so long to come out .
the outside is absolutely beautiful . the ambiance was intimate and relaxing .
the sauce , the jumbo shrimp , the tamale ... everything was delicious and went well together .
i started with the maine lobster rolls minis which had a generous portion of lobster and a light seasoning of lemon .
another team builder happy hour for work ! they had great happy hour specials for food and drink .
happy hour is a great time to go with drinks 1/2 off .
this is one of the best happy hours in the city .
drinks were excellent , too ( i was treated to a refreshing take on a pimm 's cup ) .
their service was alright , although they could 've checked on us a bit more . but there was a waitress who literally chased after us just to get a tip ; she made it seem like we were even obligated to give a tip ( which we were n't ) however , the ramen was great !
we started the meal with amazing complimentary bread and butter .
prices are very good .
this time we ordered honey butter garlic chicken and the sweet and mild chicken to go .
the staff is friendly and you 'll feel right at home .
wtf were they doing for so long .
however , no beer menu . weird .
there were 6 or 7 wontons , vegetables and garnish and the broth was good too . there were also egg noodles in the soup , which seemed a little like filler .
the servers are great , friendly , nice and always there to help !
is the fighting over dramatic and corny ?
the price was reasonable .
prompt and happy , very accommodating and hospitable service . the food was outstanding .
family owned business that truly cares about their customers ! the owner , his son come to your table and spend a while talking to you ... great atmosphere , delicious food !
cute part of town also .
the bathroom is kind of scary .
beer and margaritas available , not sure about any other alcohol .
i do not order tap beer there , the selection is very weak anyway .
make sure you check out the chandelier bar .
the only reason i took away a star is because the service is inconsistent .
average bar food and incredibly over-priced for what you get .
this place never disappoints me . after coming here for so many years , the food is still really good .
to cool the heat , we enjoyed a tall glass of thai iced tea .
the hostess was very friendly and seated us very quickly .
as a student this is a very good price !
i 'd say it was lacking that teriyaki taste you usually get with this kind of burger .
the women 's bathroom was covered in pee . i stepped in it , and now my pants and shoes smell of someone 's nasty pee .
we were told to sit anywhere , but none of the vacant tables were clean and no one seemed to be doing anything about it . the table we finally got had gum stuck under it .
it was a simple dish with excellent nuances . the texture and size of the dumplings were perfect .
happy to see a vegetarian spot in yorkville !
not anything memorable and the lighting is bright and unremarkable .
the service was fantastic , the appetizers excellent and the drinks strong .
very cool place with a comfortable atmosphere !
we enjoyed the grilled shrimp , new york , and heavenly bread pudding .
very poor customer service .
service bad food lame price expensive .
i had been wanting to try this place as it had been highly recommended by a friend .
i do n't drink but they had a huge selection of wine and beer .
the atmosphere is cozy and quirky , and the food was absolutely delicious !
prices very reasonable as well .
the price is a little higher than average but the kind service makes up for it .
they have pool tables , a nice bar , tvs , and karaoke on certain nights .
the seating was comfortable and the price was fair .
no good . clean but weird decor .
the most annoying part of our experience was the lighting .
turned out to be a great escape from the normal vegas scene .
drinks were never empty , table never dirty , fast service .
drinks were fine and they had a good selection of beers on tap .
so good - this was one of my favorite spots that i got to try in vegas .
it was kinda tasteless , did n't melt in my mouth at all , and was even slightly difficult to swallow .
live band was playing food was delicious and was not a long wait at all .
the remade burger was okay . nothing too special , did n't have the onion ring as advertised .
the masa to meat portion was perfect , in closing , this by far is some of the best tasting mexican food i have had , and we have had some great mexican in northern california .
lunch special was reasonably priced at $ 7.95 and an excellent variety of indian-chinese food .
the owner was so professional and nice !
otherwise , i was really pleased with their hot sauce . really good .
we really enjoyed the bourbon lemonade , but the mint julep was too sweet .
the kickin beans are hot and tasty .
it 's unbelievable how everything is vegan , and i love meat !
the food is consistently delicious , they have 50 beers on tap , the bartenders pour perfect cocktails with impeccable service .
puke under tables , women 's bathroom horrible , smell , glasses in sink ... .
the strawberry margaritas , while a great bargain , were a little too sugary for me .
this place is so bad i made a yelp account just to tell you all how poor it is .
the dishes was overly salty and generally lacking in flavour ( except for the salty kind ) .
anyway , i took advantage of the happy hour beer specials , but unfortunately i really hated the second beer ( something by deschutes that i think might have been skunked ) .
i drank the tasteless overpriced drink and switched to beer .
prices are reasonable too .
they call everyone by name and make you feel so welcome !
i was upset about his because i specially asked the waitress if it was a generous serving and she assured me it was .
bit overpriced for an ingredient that is n't expensive .
they were just awful and i do not think the tequila was patron .
there was a woman in a scooter ahead of us , and not gon na lie , she was a difficult customer .
but for a 500 dollar meal for two , there was nothing new or original on the menu .
order the homemade lemonade to drink , it 's so good !
beer and wine was unlimited , but they were serving only one type of beer .
and we started with one of their cocktails -- perfect for a summer night , gin , aperol , grapefruit and lemon .
great beer , wine and spirit options and awesome staff .
the only reason to come is to drink beer out of the schooner glasses but alas they only have crap beer on tap .
it looks good but all these hard surfaces make it noisy , with sound bouncing around all over .
loud inside but it 's a sports bar !
not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses , that were more like scotch glasses , only knock .
reasonably priced also . good value .
on the menu , it said ' $ 5 for appertizer and beverage ' and when the bill came , it showed $ 5 for the appertizer and $ 5 for the drink and the total is $ 10 .
prices were very reasonable .
the only let down was that there was no beer on tap .
the only reason i did not give this place 5 stars was because the waitress was a bit annoying .
decent place for an inexpensive but good lunch .
omg it was good .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
it could probably feed at least 2 adults in my opinion and for only 10 bucks .
it will cost you about $ 80 ( including a decent tip ) for two entrees , one app of bruschetta and one stella draft .
they have a very impressive wine list but we brought our own `` special '' bottle , as corkage was only $ 35.00 , which was not bad considering most other fine dining restaurants in vegas charge at least $ 50.00 for corkage .
service was awesome they were fast and friendly and a cheesy bread was absolutely delicious and hot right out of the oven .
the most expensive item on the menu is $ 7.00 ... .just making an observation .
she showed me to the table which was marked reserved .
the drinks were real lime juice & had a pretty heavy pour on the booze .
it was n't dry what-so-ever .
i have always enjoyed coming to this location .
but for us the food was only ok .
my favorite was the chicken kabobs with the garlic sauce .
my friend had a loaded hot dog and was happy with it .
i ordered the fish and chips and it was outstanding .
good service , attractive decor , and being inside the aria , has a nice ambiance .
the decor was beautiful and cozy . the greeter was also quite nice .
i would gladly pay more than $ 2.00 for this , but i appreciate that they keep their prices affordable !
shots , beer all good but i did not their food .
the sink in the men 's washroom was also disgusting .
i started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila .
pretty tasty food for a very cheap price !
talk about a depressing background to your meal .
we arrived right before happy hour was ending and asked the waitress a question regarding the special .
for some reason , entree 's are poorer , with carryout . avoid ordering any of the soups ... ... their pretty poor .
price is reasonable . quality of good is great .
it was quite filling as well . crispy duck salad was so good .
not a bad bar .
the interior of the restaurant is bland , needs some decor to brighten it up .
i think the food is delicious and priced low .
the price is pretty good as well about 7 dollars per item .
the soup arrived somewhere between lukewarm and hot .
not a bad deal for $ 14.99 .
the location is perfect and nice outdoor setting if you wish to watch the people .
nice and cozy with an inviting welcome .
the service is fast and very kind and attentive .
- sangria : not very strong but yummy .
i ordered to go once and the food was good , except they forgot my side of sauce .
in total it cost about $ 5 to build that crepe .
we shared the fried smoked fish croquettes and a chicken curry taco .
all but the orange chicken was bland and severely lacked salt .
the food was bland and boring at best .
at $ 5.99 , it 's a good bargain , especially for vegas .
amazing flavours and nice and crispy and wonderful textures with all the dishes .
the lighting is dim and my pictures sucked so no photos : )
the wine selection is good .
very tasty burgers , great selection of items .
the turkey was pretty good- but the meat could have used a little more seasoning .
on top of having a delicious treat , we were met with great service .
the buddha bowl was also great and probably one of the more filling items on the menu .
the service was good except when it came time to get the check .
i thought the interior was a little bland and the industrial chairs did n't fit the look to me .
the first time i came here was about one month into opening and the food was great .
nice bar and very happy with the friendly service .
the meatballs were absolutely amazing .
i also had the sangria which was surprisingly strong but at the same time fruity and refreshing .
oh yeah , and the restaurant itself is bad . bad spacing of the table , really small restaurant , bad ambiance .
there is a large outdoor patio as well as a ton of tables inside and a giant bar .
we finally got our hot chocolate and food and they did n't even say sorry for waiting or for being sooo slow .
good place to have a few drinks and catch up with friends and now one of my favorite spots in toronto .
super friendly , wifi , comfortable , and eclectic .
service good and heavy pour drinks .
i am ok with paying higher prices for good food , but i want the rest of the experience to match the price .
then the wine arrived and it was a decent bottle of cabernet .
it was terrible . sadly the best thing i had was the mashed potatoes .
it was one of worse sushi i ever had
which it was decent .
place was clean except the men 's washroom ... the ceiling was leaking and water was dripping everywhere .
no margaritas . just beer and wine : -/ what 's a girl to do .
it 's cheap . it 's fast .
the spouse had a delicious tomato-y sauce to dip his meats in , and lots of rice .
never had a problem with screwed up orders or rude management , in fact i 've never seen anyone there but the cook and the counter person .
i got the buddha belly bowl . it was good but the vegan chicken tasted way to real we could n't eat it..
we had tacos ( of course ) and they were delicious .
the lighting is dim and my pictures sucked so no photos : )
she was not the only one though .
it made the drink amazing . the fresh fruit mojito drink is also amazing - very light and refreshing .
we absolutely love this place . and p.s .
when the husband brought it out it was steaming hot , looked promising but after first bite the focaccia fell apart easily and the veal did not taste very fresh .
i had the buffalo chicken salad and it was really good !
awesome happy hour ! never great service , but who cares when your getting cheap ketel one vodka during happy hour !
went here to celebrate my late grandfathers birthday and the atmosphere turned the evening into a positive one .
price is mostly reasonable , although i think they should lower it just a little .
price is pretty good , too .
the decor is bright and dramatic with a blatant disregard for subtly , and yet is perfectly muted so that even the worst hang-over would be welcomed by it 's glowing neon .
no draft beer - but they have a good bottle selection .
my last visit the plating and presentation was sloppy and chicken was tough and overcooked .
atmosphere is cool because you 're able to watch the planes take off and land .
i ordered the fundido cheesy thing , it was cheesy and tasty . great margarita prices .
a small meal for two or a huge meal for one for $ 18.00 .
food was delicious . ca n't beat the $ 10 special .
the food was wonderful . the wine tower and wine list was awesome .
poor service , was going to give this place 1 star but the food is good .
my breakfast sandwich was a greasy , soggy , squished mess . the only good thing here is the fruit cup .
the draft beer was totally flat . pretty awful .
1. the price is fair for the meal but outrageous for the drink .
even the bathrooms felt classy ( this is important , let 's be honest ) !
over priced and rude service .
when i saw the pad thai it looked like it would be full of flavor , but when i tried it i found it to be bland .
not romantic , but good tacos and definitely a `` see and be seen '' atmosphere .
service was confusing at times , as the waiters were confused about who had our table .
great place to hang out and people watch .
inexpensive , fast service , and delicious authentic mexican food !
i was pretty impressed with this spot !
the staff were extremely accommodating and friendly !
the food was fine , especially for the cost .
this is a great spot to go to for soju and appetizers .
very well made drinks . good happy hour on food and drinks .
the lighting was a bit bright but what you gon na do ? i 'm too full to write a full review .
and the ingredients are really , really cheap .
the lobby was clean , bathroom was pretty dark and no toilet paper so they definitely need to keep an eye on that .
their value tacos are a really good fill in , cheap and tasty .
the interior is not bad .
price is pretty good .
i felt the veggie items were reasonable around $ 11 each , but the briyani seemed steep at $ 17- $ 18 and the meat items were also in that approximate range .
i 've had to many ugly experiences to give them my business any longer..
the chicken was rubbery and tasted like lighter fluid !
a good ayce restaurant to re-visit , but the price is bit steep .
margaritas had no alcohol in them yet they were the `` special '' of the night .
also had the one with absinthe and grapefruit -- so well-crafted , so delicious !
we tried some of the happy hour drinks .
they only had three flavors of beer and all of them were unknown to a beer drinker .
i love peaches and have never tasted one with rum and vodka .
first we were the only people waiting to be helped and it took about 5 minutes .
i especially like that water is provided on tap free of charge instead of paying some ridiculous amount for a 500 ml bottle of pure life .
we went there on a recent trip to vegas and loved it !
the coffee is decent , pricy for what it is . the food is actually really tasty , but also pretty pricy .
the dining room is elegant and makes you forget completely that you are only a wall or two away from the casino floor .
the drink pour was good though and the prices were excellent .
we set at the bar and had exceptional service , everyone working there is very friendly and knowledgeable .
but the beef was hard and dry . also raw .
add a can of soda and the total was just under $ 20 .
we got bacon and cheddar fries , which were n't anything special , it would be pretty hard to mess those up .
a great option for a cheap lunch .
not a bad bar .
our server was attentive and very nice .
we moved to phoenix a couple months ago , and we have had nothing but fantastic food until today .
the homemade tofu is still fantastic and agedashi style is my favorite way of enjoying it .
ok - and what is with the creepy baby face on the menu and decor ?
this is my kind of place !
also they either used dried basil or it was just diced up very tiny .
we ordered a bottle of wine which was full of cork .
not having beer descriptions in a beer bar is just wrong .
everything we tried was prepared to perfection , seasoned wonderfully and each dish was unique and interesting and mostly unlike dishes i 've tried at other places .
happy hour is the best this is our date night on fridays we have a great filling dinner and drinks for 30 bucks .
the restaurant itself is very clean and the staff are very nice and polite .
pasta with only a bit of tomato sauce , was despicable .
their wine selection was not bad , a good variety and a great list of cocktails !
speakeasy atmosphere was nice . band was really good .
food is good . price is good .
this is a good cheap mexican restaurant , not the greatest , but never disappointing . not sure why yelp rates this at two dollar signs for cost , definitely one dollar sign pricing .
the shakes ( alcoholic and non-alcoholic ) are wonderful , but great drinks are a given in vegas .
the wait staff were all very friendly and informative .
everything was pretty reasonably priced , too .
excellent selection of wine including some good rioja 's by the glass which is not common .
at the end when we asked for our checks things were made complicated .
the soup also gave the impression that it had been microwaved instead of broiled to melt the cheese , which is totally unacceptable .
honestly , we didnt have luck in with restaurant.. there was two dishes we got that had meat in it and one tasted too sweet and too salty for the other .
it is not cheap there though .
service is very nice and the restaurant is very clean as well .
if you go late , go for the music .
only drawback is the beer is super expensive .
the food was good and decently priced .
the bathroom was really dirty , a real turn off .
we are on vacation and it 's hard to k ow where to get healthy food so i was so glad to find this place .
i of course tried sushi some i have never tried it was amazing .
the food is tasty and reasonably priced .
reasonable prices , too .
i 'm not sure if she thought only 2 of us were drinking of if that 's all she could handle .
the food is definitely plentiful and large . the tortillas are delicious and the different meat options are seasoned nicely .
i ordered another drink as the beer flight was hardly anything .
beer selection through the roof . not a full bar though , just beer and wine .
now is nice and fresh looking for first time customer .
this may sound weird , but the shoes were actually somewhat comfortable .
the wine was incredible .
they also have a great selection of wine .
i always love coming here .
it was cold and nobody cared or apologized . the excuse was someone was in break .
i have to hand it to their signature rolls , many of them ( the non-fried ones ) are delicious .
i will definitely be recommending this place to friends and look forward to enjoying the food again .
i spent $ 70 on the worst lunch date .
$ 2.75 for a pop in a tiny glass with no refill . terrible .
the only complaint i have is the cost .
nothing fancy , though , and the walls and carpeting in the hallways were especially worn and in need of replacement .
the service is great and food prices are cheap and the meal is a-ok !
not only the room was so dated , the carpet was very filthy that you should wear slippers or those surgical booties .
the interior was nice but felt like a knock off , with paint chipped off some of the styrofoam ball ornaments .
it 's kind of awkward .
also got an amazing carpaccio with fried capers that added an awesome salty crunch and drizzled with a spicy mayo .
they 're known for their cheap , filling , and yummy breakfasts !
ambiance - a bit sad given the fluorescent lighting and location but i suppose you ca n't do much about it ¯\_ ( ツ ) _/¯
the food was amazing , taste was really savory !
service was good , all the staff were accommodating and pleasant .
it 's incredibly unprofessional to wait 2 hours for your customer to call you ; to not apologize for wasting someone 's time , $ , and killing their dinner plans ; and to be completely unwilling to make things right .
price is high , but it 's normal in vegas .
the negative aspect of this restaurant and my only complaint was the lighting and lack of privacy .
the chicken and pork sandwiches are very reasonably priced @ $ 7 .
then the decor and color is so plain and unwelcoming . not particularly clean and bright .
nice staff , fun vibe . awesome .
the food was good , nothing special however .
as i walked in , i was pretty confused about the atmosphere . the entryway was set up as a small , informal cafe where people were smoking hookah and hanging out .
the lunch food was good but perhaps a bit bland and over priced .
staff was friendly , lots of asians also dining ( always a good sign ) and our orders came very quickly .
i also like the fact that you can buy a fine bottle of wine in their wine shop and only pay $ 10 as a corkage fee .
there is also a stage and they have some pretty decent live music .
i normally do n't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature .
reasonably priced for what you get .
the onions were the worst i have ever had .
tasty food , decent prices and quick service . i especially like the chilli naan and malai kofta here .
the manicotti was almost a write off , came out rather fast and likely microwaved .
nice to try once but i think the price for 32.99 is expensive plus service charge .
bad : kinda sketchy and not very clean .
they also make very good mojitos ... .
space is clean , open and comfortable .
the decor was great !
trying to introduce `` the cool '' factor in the design only detracted from the overall readability .
like everybody has stated , ugly paintings , furniture , wall paper , furniture , etc .
cheap prices , friendly staff and good food sums it up ! i took their pulled chicken sandwich and it was amazingly seasoned and very cheap !
would recommend if you are wanting to grab drinks and appetizers . great drink selection !
both are priced at $ 2 on the `` extras '' menu , so i feel like reasonably , they should be able to make the substitution without charging , but hey , that 's the restaurant business .
the person behind the counter was friendly and helpful with suggestions .
great portions at an affordable cost .
this place was fantastic !
i did however notice different beer selection in the bottle .
i started off with a great cocktail called a tokyo schooner made with sake and ginger .
it 's super resonably priced too .
the only time it 's not great is in the middle of the summer ( as there are no misters ) .
with our dinner i have a couple glasses of the mick fleetwood cabernet sauvignon and it was a great wine .
they did give him the food to go and gave him just the salmon for free , but still frustrating .
the beer was decent , but once we finished we waited a while with empty glasses before finally having to ask for another .
it was also awesome just sitting outside in the lounge area looking over the strip .
first off , the place is adorable -- they have cakes and macaron towers on pedestal as decor .
beer and wine yes , hard booze no .
a wonderful dining experience !
wine selection was good .
the window is right around the corner and there is access to the picnic outdoor area .
i liked the casual atmosphere and the energy was good .
i do n't drink beer but the waitress said they had a good selection .
there were only 4 other parties asides from us , therefore , they were n't extremely busy .
not to mention , the restaurant is right across from the pool entrance and my boyfriend had a perfect view of someone stumbling out and vomiting in the casino but hey , this is vegas .
i enjoyed my relaxing time while there .
very good atmosphere , i 'll definitely will try this place again .
i personally loved the popcorn chicken meal because the chicken is really fragrant and super crispy .
what bothered me was the lighting - it 's very bright , fluorescent and distracting . music was a bit loud and bothersome .
it 's definitely a hip venue but it felt a little pretentious to me .
absolutely disgusting like a fatty steak .
not good business to rip someone off if your out of your advertised at the table mug .
the food is a great value for the price .
such a great deal , too- $ 9.99 for lunch , $ 13.99 for dinner , plus , it 's all you can eat !
barely warm meet and sides , sad looking salad bar , freezer burnt ice cream , bland food with tons of salt to compensate , the fish tasted like paper mush .
instead of chicken breast , she received a rather tiny portion of chicken thigh and she did n't care for the way the quinoa was prepared .
to me it 's definitely the lychee jellies that make the tea awesome .
6 beers on tap and only one watered down version if a beer , so that 's a plus .
even my glass of riesling was refreshing and a generous pour .
the cashier forgot or never learned manners which was a bad takeaway from the experience .
4 years ago i just moved to this side of town and was searching for a decent sushi place .
the decoration and interior really suck unfortunately .
only negative , not many beers on tap , we ordered three times before we got a beer listed that they actually had on tap : (
i love the cucumber martini ( and i am normally not a savory drink person ) and the dirty ginger .
great place to go if you want to pay top dollar for a supermarket quality steak .
nachos cold soggy and made with what looked like easy cheese .
good value for the price .
we wanted something with `` chips and salsa '' and a decent beer selection .
pizzas are the bomb here - they come out fast , and taste marvelous .
good parts ? the pricing is decent though and service is pretty fast !
we walked so far to get there only to be turned away waiting in line for two hours .
seasoned to be strong but not overpowering and when mixed with the rice and pita bread makes for a very delicious lunch . and you get complimentary soup too !
the food is wonderful and decently priced .
the food was okay , nothing spectacular , but enjoyable nonetheless . however , i do not recommend their guacamole ; it was bland and flavorless .
i love the meat from little miss bbq . all the meat is so juicy and tender .
they have a great happy hour and great bartenders !
unfortunately , i was not overly impressed . my meat was extremely overlooked and the flavors were a tad bland , which is shocking for filipino cuisine .
the shrimp was really tasteless . i was really disappointed
the noise level is really loud so i would n't recommend coming here for romance or good conversation .
no question about it , probably one of the best in town . my only concern is the extremely long wait times for a table and even to get your food sometimes .
food was mediocre , especially for the price i paid $ 47 for two medium three topping pizzas .
some of the best chicken fingers in town . the dipping sauces are amazing .
food is reasonable at a decent price .
both were good the chicken is bomb .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
good . reasonably priced for where it is .
food is good and reasonably priced .
from the bistro 111 house salad of baby arugula , crisp pancetta , shaved parmesan and caramelized onion dressing to the small plates of decadent lobster mac n cheese and squid ink pasta with crab , lemon and capers , everything was superb .
gr8 breakfast menu and delicious coffee cake . creative egg dishes , mexican breakfast and tasty pancakes .
it 's friggin ugly inside and its like a maze getting from one place to another .
place : no ambience , no personality almost depressing .
the interior is super rustic . this is my favorite location .
i also ordered a few house margaritas on the rocks but unfortunately only `` frozen '' margaritas were part of happy hour .
noodles are cooked well and for 10 bucks the value is great
the staff was nice and the food came pretty quickly .
well i love this place , is my fave coffee of all ... but is n't great to study or have a conversation bcz their music is too loud , is always packed ( bcz is that good ) also the ambient and the style of the place is very cool , different of what u can expect in the middle of the streets in phx central area .
glad i would walk to the bar with no issue but put a sign or something i ca n't read minds . also why advertise food happy hour if you 're not prepared to handle the business .
the waitress was very attentive and offered good suggestions throughout .
beer wise , stick to bottles .
for the price $ 13.00 it 's a great lunch spot .
this place has an awesome classic burger and i 'll definitely be returning again !
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
from the gray carpeting to the dull green walls , the cheap fixtures , the lack of art or music to the so-so food and slow service this place can best be described as dull , bland and boring mixed with no ambience at all .
i had a blended cherry sangria with frozen margarita tonight which was delicious .
we had such a great dinner at lucille .
hot fresh quick and very nice to just sit outside , drink a little wine and relax at the en of the day .
unfortunately i did not like it and ordered a bottled domestic .
not that creamy and definitely not the peppery overtones that i was expecting . a very normal and bland dish .
2. you ca n't help but smile at some of the decor which consists of quirky things on the wall and signs saying mildly amusing things .
we ordered a won ton soup , which was bland and desperately needed salt .
however the water and pop is reasonably priced ( about 1.25 ) which makes you feel better about it .
they are an awesome combination .
prices are reasonable too .
prices are definitely on the higher end and not justified .
very good and crispy with tomatoes breaking up each bite .
also , my antioxidant berry drink gave me a fantastic buzz .
horrible customer service . disappointed to not get consistent experience across different starbucks .
great room , inventive menu an good wine list .
so we asked the waiter if we could replace it with a different drink .
i think the price is very reasonable .
the rich white sauce lacked flavor , and the broccoli looked good but tasted odd . the chicken was completely different from the chicken on the salad - in a good way , but it was still kind of odd .
normally i would n't have a problem with this , but for paying $ 12 i would have expected a little more .
overall i would n't suggest this place because of their disappointing service and dry chicken and waffles .
price is not cheap but you get what you pay for .
the meatballs were tasty and the garlic bread pretty good as well .
the meal was huge ! the vegetables were fresh and cooked perfectly , the salad had just the right amount of dressing , and the steak was perfectly medium rare .
side dishes were horrible .
the chicken and beef were very very disappointing and no one should ever get those , which is probably why people are pretty upset here .
decent prices , and good food .
i am very disappointed and did not appreciate her pushy attitude and treated us like we did not know our order .
price was very reasonable as well .
my personal favorite is to get the sesame chicken , and have a friend get the chicken with veggies .
a bit of a pain for bathroom and bar ( long lines ) . decor and lights were bad ass
great food for good prices .
their pizzas are super cheesy , just the way i like it .
food was decent and staff was pleasant , but probably wo n't return because of the misleading tactic to get us in the door .
maybe it is the odor of fresh carpet ( weird because it is n't carpeted ) but it is super dark in there .
my bf ordered the watermelon cocktail drink , i forgot the full name but it 's on their cocktail drink menu .
the service was really wonderful , and everyone there was so accommodating .
great place , good food and reasonable price .
now to the hookah , we got two different ones , a blackberry peach and mint one along with a strawberry lemon one .
chicken parm sandwich best i have ever had .
only 4 stars as i find this place quite pricey , $ 10 can get you the equivalent to a personal pizza .
too bad the food was not up to par . jerk pork was extremely mild , the rice and peas was dry and flavourless , the roti shell was dried out and crunchy , the boneless chicken curry was extremely salty , the patties were mild and bland ( but you can give partial blame to the supplier as they outsource these ) .
i do n't drink beer but the waitress said they had a good selection .
the portion is more than fair for the price tag , but i 'd rather it be cheaper and smaller .
there was only one other table with people in the restaurant but they would n't give us a booth because of the `` lunch rush '' .
other than that , this place is grimy , creepy , and nasty .
the service was great , the bartender made great recommendations and made everyone at the bar feel welcome .
they have a nice outdoor area with couches and pool and bags .
loved the veal and pork chops deserts yum .
that is a good sign , my friend . the outdoor patio was n't being used at all and honestly , the dining area is pretty small , so it would 've been nice to use it but it was still too hot .
very reasonably priced , too .
would 've liked to see some drafts but nonetheless , the bottled beer selection was great .
great food and drink menu .
happy hour is a good deal with both bites and drinks on offer .
overall horrible service , long wait , and confused high school teenagers trying to take orders .
we ordered a variety of dishes and for some reason most of it was covered in a bland cream sauce .
it 's not uncommon for total strangers to just strike up a random conversation .
prices for booze are average , however i think that the prices for food are very reasonable .
the atmosphere was perfect for an evening of conversation , not too loud , semi-private seating .
i literally looked like a homeless person picking up my takeout bc i was so sick and it was when it snowed like crazy last weekend ( hence the cold shake , hot soup , spicy stuff to clear the sinus ) .
they are amazing and not only that this place itself its gorgeous and atmosphere just screams upscale and date night
save your money not worth the trip barely anything on the salad bar . half the meat was either salty or no salt at all they do n't even give ice with their water serve you some hot ass water they had some clams on the buffet they were extremely salty the only thing that was good was the service .
great food & great drinks ! i had the shrimp pasta with vodka sauce and it was delicious !
this is seriously one of my favorite places to go and bring others to .
the atmosphere was adorable ; tables were n't too close together and chairs were very comfy .
food is delicious , i definitely will be coming here more than once .
not worth $ 9 , looked pretty tho .
prices are kinda steep and high but u get what u pay for .
i ca n't remember what i ordered , i believe it was some sort of chicken but the taste lead me to believe it was pork ?
horrible , just horrible service . i gave the business 3 chances over a year to see if the service would get better .
honestly i felt like i was paying for the interior decoration and building .
it 's also a pretty expensive meal !
they have a nice formal area and a nice bar area with a lot of tv 's around .
the speciality drinks were great !
the only thing that saved it was the decor inside .
so i walk in to labella today , door open people still walking in but then get all the way up to the fucking register for them to tell me oh were closed so u could n't tell me that shit at the door .
the food is good , prices are good .
i was also totally weirded out that the bathroom had mirrored walls .
kudos to you kurt ! buca is very fortunate to have you as an employee .
prices are expensive ( at least for us ) so we would only dine here for extra special occasions .
they are also hugely disorganized and it 's a simple fix - do n't hire your friends and family - hire experienced staff and who know how to give good customer service .
all of the drinks were delicious and strong .
i can see this being fantastic for after work dinners or a special night for a couple .
yes , i should have asked but it truly never occurred to me , looking at other marked prices , to ask . otherwise , a nice restaurant .
the bartender was pretty bad .
drinks were well made and made as requested , dirty vodka martini and margaritas .
i will definitely be recommending lol to all my friends .
it was warm and inviting .
we have goat , shrimp and chicken curry .
the outside seating area is amazing when the weather is nice , and the whole inside opens up to create a really nice open feel .
the manager gave him a super dirty look and said `` why would you do that ? `` ... okay never mind ...
when a dear friend suggests that we meet for breakfast at the original pancake house , i always jump at the chance .
i will still come again because i love 5 guys .
one dish came out luke warm and neither were all that special .
ordered the veggie wrap ... absolutely horrible . frozen veggies , bland .
our server hannah was super helpful and very attentive . overall , great food , great vibes , great drinks , great service .
i just really hated the flavor .
we always leave full .
i was served the amazing and tasty mimosa that i wanted to gulp down but it tasted so good i wanted to savor each sip ( first time i drank alcohol that slowly ) .
great selection of wine .
sure , the hours are not posted or stuck to and there 's no signage and there are other issues .
most of the food was cold ... service was actually not that good ... .
their lunch special prices were very reasonable .
the margarita had hardly any alcohol in it , though .
interior designer should be shot though - eclectic design that 's incredibly confused and close to distasteful .
on the positive side , the drinks were quite good , and i really liked the ambiance of the restaurant , though the tiled floors and unadorned walls did make the place really noisy once it got crowded .
the bathroom is dirty , dirty toilets , walls are nasty , no soap & the water barely trickles out if the faucet .
bomb food but the guy taking the orders is kinda rude . would have gave it 5 stars but you know i do n't like to be treated like i 'm a inconvenience when i 'm going to eat at your restaurant and there is literally noone there .
brought in my whole family today to experience the most amazing wings that i had discovered a while ago . the wings were delicious as always along with the exceptional customer service , making this one happy family night out !
its more like a student place since its cheap and meals are pretty good in size .
really nice patio seating and restaurant decor .
the food is not cheap .
friendly and fast service .
no draft beer , but a decent choice of cans and bottles .
the bad news : the lighting was horrible , so bright you did n't even notice there were candles on the table .
great place ! the hummos is unique - lighter than average and very yummy .
nothing special . unimpressed with the salsa ( i 've had jarred that is better ) .
the orange chicken and fried rice were the only things that were edible .
everything is so fresh and reasonably priced .
i 've had their food at the scottsdale location and it 's really good , i know they will work out these kinks .
a great after work spot !
the food was terrible , ordered pulled pork sandwiches that were cold and dry . even the toasted bun was cold .
i instead went for a bottle of nz sauvignon blanc that came perfectly chill .
too bad the fries were a little underdone , can still feel the raw texture of potato in each bite .
nice room , few light bulbs not working in chandeliers ( ok so i am picky , but i think that shows no-one cares ) .
the colors are all browns to keep with the nostalgic theme , and did i mention there are mirrors everywhere ?
i had the posole soup which was awesome .
for now , make sure you keep an andrew jackson on ya !
well if you give me shitty service , i 'm going to give you a shitty tip jackass !
the seafood was incredibly tasty and fresh - you do not have to worry about any `` fishy '' tasting foods ( although ironically , what you 're eating is fish but it 's not supposed to taste fishy ... go figure ) .
it was a warmer day and a corona sounded good , however , they had a decent craft beer selection and full bar .
basically , if you want a burger , fries and a drink it will cost you around $ 15 which i find is pretty expensive .
the bartender is a champ ; mine were poured perfectly .
wine list is not huge , but thorough .
worst steak tacos ... ever . tasted like marinated cardboard served in newspaper .
awesome atmosphere , cheap prices , and great build-your-own meal selection .
the bar also has a great happy hour with half off drinks !
the chicken was kind of tough but the flavors were good .
pretty standard fare sports bar ... not going to blow you away , but also not likely to fall flat on its face . nice to have a stable place like this in downtown matthews as part of the town fabric .
great breakfast and super fun views of the airport watching planes land and take off . a must for the av geeks out there .
the hostess said something rude in return , along the lines of `` it 's not my bathroom '' .
the prices were very reasonable .
the food is good but way overpriced . the appetizers does n't deserve the price as per the portion and presentation .
they have a great choice of delicious menu items .
the lighting is pathetic .
unfortunately he was disappointed because the beer taps were frozen and they could n't pour and beers !
really , for the price it should be amazing or the sizes should be increased .
overall a nice , reasonably priced place to eat .
there was a live dj on the night that i was there so it was really loud . be prepared for that .
the food is decent bar food . they have nightly specials and are decently priced .
the drinks are phenomenal despite complaints about not having single malt scotch or classy wine .
our group was the only guests in the restaurant on a saturday night and we did n't even get enough attention ! in fact , nobody ordered dessert because the server did n't bother to return to ask if we had made our choices .
beers were not even close to full and wine poor was average .
the prices are reasonable .
add a pitcher of shock top and we were quite happy .
the restaurant has a nice casual atmosphere .
i do n't drink but they had a huge selection of wine and beer .
i ordered two vegetable tamales with a side salad and guacamole . everything was delicious except for the salad .
the presentation of the dinner was very southern and i liked that , very different and unique in scottsdale . the decor of the restaurant was very warm and cozy , but elegant and classy !
inside was still nice but at least outside you have an outstanding view that balances the average food .
especially when you factor in how much they cost .
the girls had skinny margaritas that came in what looked like `` toy '' glasses and had hardly any tequila .
nice space , decent food .
what a relief to know that i was n't inconveniencing them excessively by asking to leave off the cheese !
unfortunately he was disappointed because the beer taps were frozen and they could n't pour and beers !
the margaritas were strong and a pitcher was more than enough for the 4 of us .
reasonably priced for good quality food .
it 's not a fancy place , but very comfortable .
as for a drink , i got the kentucky mule which was refreshing . mixed well .
excellent sushi and amazing service ! this is my new favorite sushi place .
the food is delicious and very reasonably priced .
started playing pool with a pool league here and i can honestly say i am quite happy with the place .
ca n't explain why but it seems very harsh and not homey despite the booths lining the walls of the place .
vibes are chic and cool with dim lights , music , and industrial decor .
pretty tasty ( and reasonably priced ) spot . $ 7 for classic poutine .
wine and beer selection is pretty extensive and the server seemed very knowledgeable as to what was a good wine pairing .
it was pretty late on a thursday night and we were glad this restaurant was will open .
very beautiful ambience good coffee equal to starbucks . people go try nice to have in our neighborhood .
price is resonable not so expensive .
found out about this place from groupon and used a $ 10 for $ 15 . it was great !
i had the grilled halibut with side salad - over $ 13 for a small thin piece of fish , overcooked and dried out .
a grilled chicken breast 's finest hour .
i found out my love for watermelon and alcohol drinks here .
the food is good and the $ 5 alcohol special is nice . the tacos are really solid , but pricey for how small they are .
i know that three of the tables commented to their servers ... and other than an 'i 'm sorry its loud ... and in my case a sincere apology ' , nothing was done .
made you feel special . prices were reasonable .
the service was great and while it was a bit noisy ( as you 'd expect ) , it had a really cool vibe .
this place is awesome .
hopefully the rude staff members are no longer working there .
the atmosphere of the place was nice and comfortable .
it is less expensive than caesars or the wynn , but the quality is pretty close .
beer and wine yes , hard booze no .
great tacos and an awesome lunch special ! the hot sauce is really hot so do n't mess around with it !
they have a good selection of rolls , with plenty of options to enjoy .
only shining star was the decor .
our favourite are the chicken pakora and mongolian beef .
the food is good but the drive thru service is extremely slow and more often than not , they mess up the order . frustrating .
the servers are very nice and attentive .
i had the duck , average , my wife had the traditional alsatian dish , sausages in a pot with cabbage and sauerkraut .
pretty standard vietnamese food overall but getting a giant bowl of soup for 8 bucks is hard to beat .
i 've driven by this place many times and i 'm glad i finally gave it a try !
the gobbler turkey sandwich is awesome , served with a generous amount of cranberry sauce !
the food and drinks we did see looked great , and the vibe inside was nice .
great burgers for $ 15- $ 20 each . a little bit of a wait but manageable but the burger quality was incredible .
believe that was a bad move ... plus there is a $ .50 charge on credit cards under $ 15 ... pretty lame too .
the service was exceptional and there was live music .
everytime i have visitors in town , i always bring them here because this restaurant delivers good food and service .
even tho it 's crazy hot , they have an awesome misting system on the patio , so we made a dive for the last open table .
i felt kind of dizzy a little bit to when i went to the bathroom because the room had these slanted walls at the sink too .
when we got there , i did n't realize the lighting was super bright with funky light colors .
the decor is abysmal ; it looks like an applebees that has n't nailed all of the crap to the walls yet .
they said there were people lining up in front and it would n't be fair .
what an amazing place for its location , you do n't have all the tourists of the las vegas strip . by far an amazing place to eat great for their steak special .
good food , good service , good price , ca n't beat that .
i have no problem paying good money for a nice meal , however at $ 150 before tip for some mediocre chinese food is insane .
food is reasonably priced .
for $ 8 and being right on property , its great .
my husband got a curry dish and loved it .
also , the women 's restroom was dirty and there were paper towels all over the floor .
i was underwhelmed with the decor and dirty windows besides all of that lets talk about the food .
they have a good selection of food and drinks ( had the prosciutto pizza that was topped with heaps of arugula ) to choose from .
would not have paid those prices otherwise for very average food .
fine cocktails , great selection of sake .
prices are great too .
however i was a bit disapointed . fried chicken was kind of bland but nice and juicy and the fried catfish was kind of soggy .
so sad the potion was small , i could have easily eaten maybe 3 of them for how good it tasted .
place is decently price and delicious .
we were n't happy with the attitude of the worker and told her no .
the sushi is impeccable ... from the rice to the freshest and high quality fish ... presentation is attentive ... and all is prepared with love and respect for the ingredient ... .
glad they have two locations in vegas .
i will say that the glass of peach iced tea i had with my meal was delicious .
the chicken was bland , flaccid and worthless . the veggies , although fresh and crisp added nothing to the dish .
the atmosphere is very lively , and it 's a beautiful space .
our server christina was super accommodating and friendly ; made our whole birthday celebration brunch that much better
i thought the tap list was great even though i did n't have a beer .
unfortunately , no bud light lime on tap so we just drank regular beer .
i 'm happy to report that it lived up to expectations and is certainly worth the drive .
minor minuses : i did n't love the decor , i wanted it to be more dimly lit and more cozy some how .
keeping up with the appearance of the store is also important so the concrete floors was a turn off , at least acid stain it .
the food is pretty great for such a low price .
i think that an additional skewer at lunch should have a lunch price so that an $ 8.95 lunch special does n't turn into $ 16 plus tax and gratuity .
i highly recommend the mango elderflower margarita and the oaxacan sunrise . they were both fantastic !
i have also been able to attend their supper clubs .
the only negative is that i wish they had a larger selection of beer on tap . they had 7 beers on tap but they did have a huge selection of bottle beers .
first , the decor - yes , it 's all about nacho libre with not only images of masked wrestlers on the walls , but the taps were masked too .
the place is attractive , but neither upscale nor particularly intimate though we required a flashlight to read the menus .
not everyone out there are jerks like that lady : )
oh , and the décor is in need of refreshing . looks very outdated .
i had the french quarter salad w/ grilled chicken and it was fantastic . service was good and the food came relatively fast for a lunch rush .
beers were $ 1 at the bar which rules , and they had some sort of hefeweizen that tasted good to me .
however the food was nothing special considering the price .
i have been gone to this place every time i am looking for a good decent meal .
terrible service . the hostess - holly is unfriendly and borderline rude .
everything is kind of `` meh '' . nothing really blew me away except for the fried cauliflower .
would not return again because of that unpleasant experience .
they are quick and cheap .
i asked about beer selection and was disappointed that they only carried the standard domestics and imports .
we had the factory hummus with home made pita which was great .
the location in the gramercy is nice , but just the fact that it in a very nice and well put together style courtyard with plenty of outside seating and lighting .
all i can say is yum ! love the bread and dipping oils and every meal i 've ever had here .
i 's only $ 12 ( one more than the regular dinner ) .
indoor and outdoor seating , good music , and smallish but tasty menu with breakfast and lunch options .
i do n't drink beer , but my friends do and they said their beers were just ok , nothing spectacular .
i finally had to ask if that was all and she looked at me like i was dumb then said `` yeah . ''
she had the lion lemonade and i had the passion fruit mojito . both were excellent .
i inquired further whether or nor i could buy this to go and the staff checked with the manager and condescendingly told me no i ca n't buy food that they have in stock that they can easily prepare because it 's not happy hour .
service was fast and friendly .
the fried ravioli were a nice menu option though and very yummy .
this is one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas .
love this place , i always get my pho fix at this place .
we will be coming back for sure next time when we in town . ask for italy our wonderful waiter what a nice gentlemen he was
i have been here a handful of times and it has always been very mediocre but i keep wanting to give it another chance .
i 'm so glad ta lew moved into this place .
when i looked at the prices on the food menu i was kind of furious , these prices are jumped up even for westmount and it bothers me that people pay for it .
the severs are very attentive .
the drink was great .
the chicken was both white and dark meat and seasoned perfectly .
i understand that it is valentines day and there are more people here then normal , but the food and service should not suffer .
rich to the point of being inedible .
did n't care for the thin noodles .
the espresso crusted bison strip and pork belly app are phenomenal . their cocktails are also strong and tasty .
it has only been open for a couple of weeks as we stopped by this evening .
my pasta was also very good . it was the perfect portion size and also came with a drink and bread -- -all for $ 8 !
i normally do n't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature .
thank you joseph and all the staff to made our weekend great .
came with a big , soft piece of pita bread which was also amazing - most pita you get tends to be hard and thin , but this was soft and fluffy and great .
this was a great experience .
he personally delivered a blackberry lychee martini that was n't on the menu and it was wonderfully delicious . the bf also enjoyed his la perle ( brut ) .
for $ 10.00 it was not appetizing at all .
i love yelp ! i never would have found this place without them .
and if you 're not willing to get rid of those lights or turn them off , put in warm bulbs -not cool .
great food but the server signal one of my friends out asking her why she did n't give a tip . we had paid seperately and i had already paid my share along with the tip for my entire group .
tap water there is terrible but is kind of necessary when drinking cocktails .
it definitely has a casual bar and grill feel , and they 've set it up to make everyone comfortable regardless of dress .
the atmosphere of this restaurant is nice especially if you get seated by the lake view tables .
the decoration and interior really suck unfortunately .
nasty and weak margaritas that were being poured from a bucket . plain entrees .
when you are spending $ 100 on lunch you expect good service .
wow , very tasty , properly seasoned and balanced with cilantro , onion , lime , and tomato .
and sometimes the lighting makes me feel like i 'm being interrogated ( it 's a little dark and creepy ) .
both servings of the rice were bland with no flavor .
the wait was very long for table and it got worse from there .
the only thing i was n't into was the decor , i can see the charm in it but it felt dusty and old without charm .
this place is a great bargain .
and while $ 4.50 per slice is generally pretty steep , it 's not all that surprising considering the place is in one of the newer , luxury properties along the las vegas strip .
the room was old and tiny which i could have dealt with too but the wallpaper in bathroom was filthy . the entire bathroom was dirty .
the bad : it 's so ghetto .
the service is impeccable .
they have a great outdoor space .
the team is helpful and knowledgable ! try everything - especially the burrata appetizer and if you can get michelle to make you a gin and tonic ( amazing ) !
the ceiling tiles are in bad shape , with lots broken and stained . the whole ceiling looks bad .
the whole set up is kind of awkward .
started with the sangria it was delicious .
portions are definitely reasonable , although certainly not cheap .
there were the normal beer options ( no craft ) and the wine was barefoot so nothing to write home about .
just kind of scary .
my party said that we never experienced something like that before .
enjoyed two cocktails one with some ginger syrup , great .
the calamity jane drink was serious perfection - great for those who like a sweeter drink .
the 30 % was usually either too sweet or too bland .
so sad to write this review because the restaurant is lovely with beautiful views .
i live close and it 's nice to have it here .
absolutely delicious ! fresh ingredients made for a very enjoyable hot bowl .
service was excellent as was the wine we ordered ( a rioja ) .
they make an excellant espresso martini ( with real espresso ) , the mohito is fantastic as well ( i might want it served in a taller glass , instead of a rocks glass ) .
although we did n't try a margarita , they do have a pretty good beer selection .
prices reasonable . friendly .
friendly bartender with great selection of tequila . only went for drinks , but their chips & salsa were great and complimentary .
here the service and more importantly the reaction of management was just miserable .
i did n't believe the total price , about $ 120 .
yep ... the prices are high ... figure on $ 45+ per person .
sauce was excellent . wedding soup was great .
the mushrooms as a side went perfect .
in the summer or early fall , it 's a great place to hang out as the windows are open and you can feel the nice breeze .
they have only a few beers on tap , a pretty good choice of bottled beer and a basic bar stock .
$ 40/person or something crazy like that .
it was okay the interior decorations was very amusing .
so , i definitely recommend wildfish seafood grille for their food , atmosphere , service and their cocktails and wine list offer great pours as well . enjoy !
while i liked the ham and chorizo in the sandwich , the hot dog tended to overpower the other meats in the torta .
1. lighting level is way to dark , very hard to read the menu .
i highly recommend the chicken kabobs and the eggplant appetizer .
the bill came out to be about $ 126 with tip and taxes which imo is overpriced for mediocre food .
what a great find at 2:30am . super friendly staff who is knowledgable about the food .
the tables have hard wooden benches that are a bit uncomfortable .
i hate the fact that the menu is written all over the walls ( including wine ) difficult to read since it is very dim .
- mushroom noodles - wonton noodles - grilled chicken wings - xo four season beans - assorted vegetable chow fun - chiu chow style rice cakes - beef and tomato and rice conclusion : everything was delicious !
not only was my coupon not honored , but they put on a $ 3 delivery fee without telling me .
3- pizza ; thin crusted with spots of yummy char on the crust from the oven .
we still tipped $ 20 even though we were sat in the booth closest to the kitchen on a saturday night when the place was not even halfway full .
the colors are all browns to keep with the nostalgic theme , and did i mention there are mirrors everywhere ?
bonus , it was cheap to .
in an area and city where asian food dominates , this place is by far my favorite and i will be coming back week after week as long as they can keep up the quick , personal service and amazing food .
the food is a great bargain .
first time loved our food and incredible service .
the location is great because it is close to the river and park bench to relax and eat .
i should have gone with wine since bad wine is better than pbr , coors light , or the m pilsner style ( not real pilsner ) beer that the server knew nothing about .
the prices are also reasonable .
the staff is extremely polite and efficient . the place is very nicely laid out and extremely comfortable .
price point was fair and reasonable for the upscale treatment you receive .
cheap eats at a good price .
it 's a trendy little spot in the saguaro hotel .
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
i got the bramble on cocktail which was delicious and refreshing .
prices are decent and the service was very good .
we had the fondue which is rich creamy .
i love this restaurant .
very well-kept and the layout is great : two huge garage door style walls that open in the spring/summer , stage for live music , private meeting room , and comfortable seating for dining .
thank goodness we added the peppercini ( spelled wrong , not fixing ) otherwise i would have been convinced that i was chewing on a piece of cardboard .
but there 's not a whole lot of substance to hold up all that pretentious vibe .
good food , great prices .
great cocktails , but no draft beer . need i say more ?
we sat on the covered patio , which gave a nice ambiance .
you definitely ca n't beat the prices either , super cheap for hh .
you get 12 wings for around $ 5.50 . they offer a special too of about 75 wings for $ 27 if you need to fill a boatload of peeps .
although the price is great , i 'd rather pay a little more for good service
the bf thoroughly the taco and the house margarita was good enough to keep drinking !
as we returned to the restaurant , we asked them to please make us a new pizza , did n't mention `` false advertising '' at all , just that we wanted it replaced .
great food and wine at decent prices .
shots , beer all good but i did not their food .
this little quaint cafe is perfect .
not muddled properly , and it tasted like gin not rum ... .let 's try the nachos ... .hmmm canned guac , canned jalapeño , and add chicken that is cold and cut up from the night before . at least the spotted beer glasses are cold ... .
our waiter johnny came highly recommended and might i say he treated us very well . thank you for a pleasant experience .
the ladies working the front line were super friendly and helpful .
the only knock is that there was no beer on tap ; bottle selection was good though .
very expensive for so-so food .
there is also a lot of seating and pretty much an overabundance in outlets , which is amazing .
when i finally managed to flag down the waiter who was loudly flirting with the table next to us , and asked for an explanation , he could offer non .
prices are great as well .
breakfast is freaking expensive . something you can do at home will cost you $ 14 here .
great service even as we walked in 15 minutes before close .
my only complaint was that their `` mystery beer '' , which appears in the draft beer pages , was a bottle of an octoberfest beer .
i strongly suggest going here to grab a drink and some grub .
i visited lulu 's for the first time in three years this weekend with a friend , and was not impressed .
nice work guys ! great service and the food was very good .
love the positive energy , vibe and decor upon walking into the restaurant .
reasonably priced as well .
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
beer selection was horrible ( typical of canada ) and on top of that they were out of the one beer that 's barely drinkable . wine selection was nearly as bad .
$ 14 for pancakes and eggs is overpriced in that area . for the price , the quality and service were not great .
the bathroom is dirty , which was turn off for me .
they 're pretty reasonably priced for the most part .
with lots of downtime that could lead to really , really awkward conversation .
there 's a great view of the strip from up there , whether you opt to sit inside or out .
great prices for the strip .
the price is good too .
we ordered a house wine and a draft beer , nothing complicated .
interior designer should be shot though - eclectic design that 's incredibly confused and close to distasteful .
everything is so good .
the restaurant itself is sort of corny with crude and silly signs posted .
i was however , very disappointed with the prime rib as the meat was dried up and the size of bacon bits ... certainly not like the slices of prime rib that i had envisioned .
and it 's truly a good bargain for the price .
there were the normal beer options ( no craft ) and the wine was barefoot so nothing to write home about .
the low-quality led pot lights give this place a depressing , cold atmosphere . it may seem unimportant , but it 's not : the lighting changes the look of the food , and that affects how we experience it .
it is my kind of neighborhood bar .
and again , great cocktails .
another had a peppery chicken dish that looked really good ( did n't get to try it ) .
the staff was excellent and really friendly .
super friendly , super helpful , and super quick !
the decor was done very nicely , but they ruined it with the lighting .
we completed the meal with a large sapporo and a hot house sake . it was a very lovely meal with great service .
great cocktails , had their version of a margarita and dug it .
it is reasonably priced for the high quality delights !
it was presented in a light corn sauce which flawlessly accented the main ingredient .
however 1. no one tells you this and 2. there are no signs that indicate this , you kind of have to figure it out and ask other bewildered starving customers .
it was nice that they had draft beer .
it 's only $ 2 more and is literally four or five times bigger than the cup .
both our soups were amazing -- just wonderfully seasoned . for an entree we had the fried eggplant -- again , the seasoning was just wonderful .
order the watermelon sling for a refreshing treat .
the prices are moderate and the food is quite tasty .
the only problem that could be is parking .
i just spent $ 50 on a supremely mediocre meal . there is no way this is a $ $ place , no way you get out of here for under $ 40 a person .
i know it 's going for an authentic old-time appeal - but it 's dark , dirty and kinda icky feeling .
cool wine list as well .
all wines were offered at 5oz price for 8oz pour ... a great deal ! cc offered some amazing 3 course meals .
the draft and bottle beer selection is legit , but mostly focused on regional selections which was disappointing .
country music , line dancing on a nice size floor , bull rides and beer .
the burger was juicy , flavorful and was of great quality . i enjoyed every bite .
it was an awesome drink .
there were only four other tables with two or three people sitting at them , yet it took 40 minutes for our food to arrive !
one star off because , while it is a nice romantic setting , the lighting in there was way too dim to read the menu . i 'm in my 20 's and my eyesight is fine but i do n't think it would hurt to turn the lights over the tables up a little bit .
only thing is that the bathroom there is kind of ghetto .
the drinks were great !
food is good . prices are fair .
they ambiance is nice .
there were the normal beer options ( no craft ) and the wine was barefoot so nothing to write home about .
the staff was fantastic - very welcoming .
only reason i am docking a star is because the interior is pretty cold and stark ( for now - sounds like the interior decor is still in the works tho ) .
the loco moco was terrible . the sauce was almost non-existent , the meat was pretty poor quality , my over-medium egg was over cooked on the outside so it was hard to cut into .
they have a great beer and wine selection and bartenders are all very friendly .
everything that you touch there , after walking on the carpet , gives you a nice , static electrical shock .
the restaurant is clean and the service was great .
the only downside to this restaurant is the space .
we also had a cheese plate and the pork cheeks for appetizers and they were great .
the fried chicken is fresh , juicy , and perfectly seasoned .
i do n't even understand how that 's possible .
the waiters were very friendly .
the specials are good , prices are really good .
unless you have a thing for weak , tasteless cocktails , i suggest ordering a beer or glass of wine .
8 bucks for lunch is n't bad either .
reasonable prices and drinks are not bad .
it 's a reasonable price and it tasted good .
great value compared to the high prices we had been paying all over the strip during our trip .
decent price for good food and a nice atmosphere . karaoke price is ok but with food and drinks it 's reasonable .
i i have to give her props as after she took charge found she was very attentive .
i really love this place .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
it was very quiet and we had a nice table near the windows that overlook the river .
good food with a large selection , decent prices , nice atmosphere , friendly staff with tv 's everywhere & a beautiful front patio . i would give it 5 stars if they had a pool table & dartboard for something to do if you just want to hang out .
the price might be a bit high , but here is where `` you get what you pay for '' .
both came with this tomato based sauce and it was really bland .
the food is good and decently priced .
the food is pretty good and reasonably priced for downtown cleveland .
great background noise , plenty of space ( especially for downtown toronto ) , and fun staff make it a 5 star venue for me .
the place seemed nice , but i do n't understand the whole dim lighting thing in restaurants .
great food and easy on the pocket is an a+ in my book .
i know most beer drinkers prefer piss like corona and budweiser and heineken , but us beer snobs are kind of left in the cold it seemed .
i can not adequately describe how bad it was , the dough , the cheese and the sauce would not compete well with the worst frozen pizza .
$ 16 for two drinks was also crazy .
the appetizer with the corn cakes - very good !
after such a bad experience you would think they would also cover the one glass of wine and pint of beer but nope !
i did n't try the beer , but it looked like decent alcohol choices .
took another 10 min to get our first drink , which 20 min seems excessive to wait for a drink from seating .
we were offered free dessert , sorry but that does n't make up for the really bad service .
both of them were not that great . the curry flavours were horrible .
great food , great staff , great music , great atmosphere .
i had been going to their vaughan location and it was always problem trying to find and an open table at all especially on the weekends !
the only thing i have to comment about is the poor service .
other sushi places i can spend $ 20 bucks easy on my self !
i enjoyed the house favorite of bone marrow served with garlic croutons and pork sisig tacos . both excellent .
the ribs are only $ 1 apiece so it 's easy to splurge .
ambiance kind of sucks .
there was no lineup of customers to get in and the restaurant was only 3/4 full at the time .
go there today as soon as you read this awesome place .
good service and great feel when you visit . i love this place !
however , i did n't really care for the salsa , it had a weird artificial , vinegar preserved taste .
the price is great also .
lousy service , locals only .
food is good ... but service has an attitude . too bad .
this team member was completely rude to us while we were there .
we were there during the sauvignon blanc tastings and all 4 wines were pretty good . the wine and cheese list were good , the service was friendly and atmosphere was very relaxing .
the place is not as quaint and intimate as nyc 's restaurant .
everyone is so friendly and attentive .
hi all , the whole experience was fantastic !
light flaky and crispy waffles that are made into sandwiches or served with homemade preserves and butter .
it was also pretty inexpensive for what you get .
menu , not so much ... decent food . not the best fish taco , but not the worst .
i had the burger and it was incredible , and my wife had the roasted chicken which she also said was amazing .
the hotel is pretty nice and the new tower that they built is beautiful .
its brightly lit , boring , and still had halloween decorations up and it was may .
3 ) restaurant ambience was nice and comfortable !
we always enjoyed the beers and cocktails .
the patio is awesome during the winter time . i recommend the mousaka .
the food is fairly good and is n't too expensive . the atmosphere is chill and they play great music all of the time .
it might sound weird , but check out the bathrooms .
nice and busy so the customers speak for the product they sell here
not impressed , especially with the $ 30ish price tag .
the place was dirty , the soy sauce containers were disgusting and you can tell they were very old as the glass was not clear but opaque and black almost .
place was good overall . the pizza was pretty authentic and the appetizers were good .
it 's in the ghetto and feels ghetto but it 's amazing ! so do n't let the looks put you off .
their pizza was horrible and drenched in grease .
as for my husband and myself we love the margarita chicken and the chips and salsa is the best starter .
the only real flaw it they should put padding on the ceiling or wall to suck up the loud noise from the plastered customers ..
beers were not even close to full and wine poor was average .
they have over 400 bottles on their wine list , and the make excellent craft cocktails .
we went on a thursday night from the strip around 745pm and were surprised to find a wait .
the food is decent and reasonably priced , perfect for lunch or late-night eating .
i 've never received bad service here and you wo n't either .
the groupon was for 4 adults for $ 96 , which included the buffet and unlimited wine , champagne or beer so it came out to about $ 24 a person ... .you can not go wrong with that in vegas .
great variety not your typical bar food . we shared a couple dishes they have gluten free , healthy as well as your bar standards .
i 'll be returning on my anniversary : )
food was decent and reasonably priced .
2 for 1 patron drinks made my day ! great drink stop
very small and cute but it 's quite the gem .
wait staff was very attentive .
it 's really nice to sit outside on the flower covered patio ‍
well drinks are pretty weak , so i stick to beers .
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
this place was as real disappointment .
great atmosphere and i love that they have a non-alcoholic drink menu in addition to the extensive variety of drinks they offer .
i know you do n't expect anything for 60 $ but seriously guys charge 20 more and make the rooms livable .
we put in our drink order for a refreshing pinot grigio and the fritto misto .
they also have beer and wine which is fantastic .
lola is a great restaurant . the decor is beautiful .
for a very good price too !
there was also a good selection on tap , but there were no descriptions of the beers on tap , nor were there any prices for beer indicated on the menu .
at $ 18 per person this was a magnificent place to enjoy for lunch .
try going during happy hour at their nutty bar for really good deals on food and drinks .
my salmon i ordered medium and it was perfect with a very nice crust .
this is a great place to stop off after work and grab a pint or two .
i 'll be surprised if i live past the age of 30. the workers are very friendly .
i 'm guessing the place fills up at night time because its huge in here .
we were fortunate enough to be placed at a corner table where we all enjoyed the striking views of the strip all lit up at night !
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
the decor is abysmal ; it looks like an applebees that has n't nailed all of the crap to the walls yet .
great food , good prices .
it took about 15 minutes for us to be seated which is great considering it 's usually a long wait to get in .
i was n't a fan of the gelato . it was more like an ice cream texture and the flavors were n't anything new special ( chocolate chip and also the lemon were the only ones i tried )
good service , good food and reasonably priced .
what was n't great was how we had to call our server over .
the atmosphere fits right in with the hard rock .
their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers .
my go-to , regardless of how extremely oily it is ) , fried turnips ( which are sooooo good . highly recommend .
the location was very convenient , in the district , and ambiance was lovely .
no full bar , only beer .
nonetheless , it was nice to be able to look out the extra-large windows without feeling the extra-large wind that day .
we enjoyed their daiquiri shooters , and i had a really nice hard cider from seattle .
since that time i talked to bar tender and we are good , she said she did not hear me , i believe her
ordered the koobideh , lamb shank , and hummus , which were all delicious .
very dirty ... they dont even clean the rooms . the walls had nasty stuff all over them along with the bathroom floor .
i ordered the spicy yellowtail roll and the crunch scallop it was delicious
wow so i asked what was going on , the manager said oh i thought you said a different address . i said so that means you was n't listening to me ?
and intentionally overcharge for sides , like cream for pancakes every other location it 's about $ 1.00 at this location it 's $ 8.00 and if you complain the lady who works at night just talks crap to you .
the not so good : my vegetarian pho was very bland , i had to add massive amounts of sriracha and soy sauce to give it any flavor at all .
the decor is a little tired , hole in the wall - but not horribly off putting .
the restaurant itself is sort of corny with crude and silly signs posted .
excellent presentation of uniquely creative sushi .
$ 10 cover to get in and drinks are reasonable . for smokers in the summertime there is an outdoor patio .
good selection , decent prices , and quick service .
putting a freshly cooked egg on top is a must . extremely delicious and unique experience .
great experience . we live in a dry desert , so enjoy the rainforest environment .
the food was ok , service ok. higher end pub food and costs it . steaks pretty tiny for the cost and again just ok .
the decor is a bit weird for the ambiance of the restaurant , i guess its a talking piece .
i love this place !
decor is weird since the ceiling looks like it should belong in an italian joint ( fake vineyard look complete with grapes ) .
price was fair and friendly .
the beer glasses were n't even frothy , and the beers on tap that arrived were n't even cold .
the decor is what i would call modern or trendy . clean .
the house margarita was n't bad either .
it 's kind of a charming , petite place with one small counter dining space along an exposed brick wall .
they have a lot of beers on tap but i got a weird look when i asked for a beer list .
the staff are friendly and the place is clean enough .
pretty laid back and relatively reasonably priced place .
not to mention , the view at this place is beautiful !
the sides were fine and we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine .
for lunch , this location is packed like a mall on christmas eve , especially considering the location is fairly tucked away .
the desserts would have been highlights of the meal if it were n't for the excellent oysters .
good prices as well .
my sister and i were looking for a place for a lunch date and decided at this location for a great lunch .
the luxury of this hotel has such a gorgeous opulence with beautiful chandeliers and gorgeous flooring .
i had the lunch special which was a 1/2 sandwich and salad . food was great and delivered quickly .
it 's the perfect place for a special dinner out or a great place to enjoy a drink and fresh shellfish in the bar/ lounge area .
nice looking location with indoor and outdoor seating . staff are friendly and responsive .
they have plenty of space and you will not feel claustrophobic in here .
good vibe , nice people .
only disappointment was on the menu , they give a few different options for rice .
the food is decently priced ( for the strip ) with a meal costing around $ 20 per person ( not including alcohol ) .
the resort has some small pools set up for guests that reminded me of melrose place - lounge chairs , hot tubs , palm trees and a small clubhouse with bathrooms and endless towels .
the bartender should focus more on making her hopefully returning customers happy instead of mingling with her friends and making sure they get food while i had nothing even 45 min before the kitchen `` closed '' .
wonderful ambiance , and patio available for those rare perfect weather days !
the margarita was weak but ok and there is no way to screw up a cold corona !
this time , i tried the rum punch and i could easily spend a whole evening sipping on that delicious fruity cocktail .
fyi , the prime rib sandwich lacked flavor and the bread was bland , did not compliment at all .
items like an all natural hot dog , gooey grilled cheese , savory tomato soup , bacon wrapped dates and a few other dishes should keep everyone 's taste buds happy .
service from bartender was excellent , he took care of us all night dealing with our drink and food orders and the tequila cocktail with maple syrup and rosemary was super tasty .
i wish i did n't split it with my boyfriend because i was sad when it was all gone . their lasagna was made with spinach noodles which at first i did n't think i would enjoy but i really did .
i will say that the drink selection was good and they had some good beers on tap .
very tasty rice plate with plantains , chicken , beef stew and vegetables . great value and cooked to perfection !
if you like your food dry then this is the place to come the staff was rude and non approachable .
was very attentive checking in on us the right number of times .
low quality but for the price i still give 5 star . and actually the quality is only a tiny but better at secret pizza which is way more expensive
so glad i work around the corner from this place .
great atmosphere and service . all around great experience .
seems weird to have a bartender that did n't know how to make the margaritas on the menu .
almost missed the monday special ( $ 1 pizza and $ 2.50 drafts ) , but they went ahead and served us anyway .
the beer was good , but the margarita came with no more than an inch of the glass rim salted ( `` is n't that bartending 101 ?
this little place in bridgeland boasts a stylish and comfortable space , friendly staff and the freshest , most brilliant middle eastern food around .
beer selection was horrible ( typical of canada ) and on top of that they were out of the one beer that 's barely drinkable . wine selection was nearly as bad .
with free sliders and well poured drinks , it 's a nice hangout .
the salad bar was amazing as well -- so many different salad options with a diverse range of toppings , which is excellent since i 'm very picky about salad fixings .
2. you ca n't help but smile at some of the decor which consists of quirky things on the wall and signs saying mildly amusing things .
we sat at the bar on a wednesday night and had great service and great food including the margarita pizza and the spinach ravioli . the happy hour drink specials until 6p were also an added bonus .
max , our server , was so friendly and helpful ! he made sure we were enjoying our time and was very good at checking up on us .
friendly and engaging staff too : )
the cocktail was delicious - so refreshing , not too strong and not too sweet .
the steak lacked in flavor and it did n't wow me .
for these two we payed 20 $ which is very good price
for me the prices were super reasonable too .
look was kind of drab .
the servers are pleasant and the atmosphere is a bit upscale but overall the place is pretty cool .
peach beer was delicious as always .
the wine list is pretty good as well .
the atmosphere here was very cool . contemporary music playing at the right levels , fast friendly service .
good wine list too .
i thought the food and service here was splendid ! we had sea bass and lamb chops .
the food and drinks are quite cheap and good quality .
we each started with a glass of chardonnay but no appetizers as we knew we would n't be able to finish it all .
only issue is the price - hefty , but by las vegas strip standards , it was a good deal .
glad to hear the outta towner below was favorably impressed . cleveland rocks !
their prices were also reasonable .
to be fair i honestly did n't know who my waitress was .
the one thing i noticed is that the decor is either intentionally older or very outdated .
the bartender warned me that it was not a weak drink .
their noodle dishes are very tasty , and we like ordering the tomato base noodles . as well , we like their beef wrap which is a famous northern china dish .
not sure why some say the decor was upscale .
the ambiance is everything ! gives you the perfect intimate romantic setting with fun dj ready to part vegas mood .
draft beer selection was not extensive , but they offered tastings ( poured more than fairly ) and the beers they had were really good .
the 6 dollar margarita was terrific and refreshing .
the selection was very poor as far as bottled beers and what was on tap .
it was cold and i wanted hot and sour soup .
when we got there , i did n't realize the lighting was super bright with funky light colors .
finally , i ordered a tiramisu which for dessert which was only okay .
first the burger was flavorless , and way overcooked . it was a bit difficult to eat since it was not juicy .
this is absolutely my favorite spot in scottsdale .
the spicy uncle louie is delicious , for drinks their sangria is great and the cucumber bay breeze is so refreshing .
the only downside is you pay for parking . $ 3 for the day and mto validates for 1/2 of the charge .
the mixed drinks and wine were very good .
located in flamingo hilton , this restaurant kinda reminds me of rainforest cafe , hard rock cafe , etc .
a great patio to sit on when the sun is out .
it was about 9 dollars a heads with a drink which is fair for what you get in quality .
and their gift shop was ridiculously overpriced - i 'm pretty sure a pint glass was no less than $ 10 .
service seems to be getting worse and worse ... went twice and both times had a bout of mild to moderate diarrhea .
not exactly an adventurer here , so i tried the green dragon - delicious !
wonderful end to a great day .
servers are attentive and quick . highly recommend the brunch .
the only reason to come is to drink beer out of the schooner glasses but alas they only have crap beer on tap .
first and foremost they rush you through the line as fast as possible , slapping your food together like it owes them money .
she was kind and friendly which always makes the experience better .
asked if i needed water when i coughed just once , kept asking if i needed help or suggestions , kind and patient people .
i would have given it a five star except that it is a bit unclean around the edges ( floors , fixtures , lights , booths ) that could be improved easily .
really good and refreshing iced tea ! i stopped by to run in and grab some liquid because i was really feeling dehydrated and had a fantastic tropical iced tea !
i only hope that the management will learn from these comments .
love the outdoor seating - until the fire engines come blaring by .
they do n't serve hard alcohol but have beer and wine .
nice ambiance ( although the frames without pictures creeped me out a bit .
they were out of corona so i had a beer on tap sorry do not remember name but it was good .
good stuff . its pretty no frills food - cheap prices , quick service , but tasty , tasty eats .
keeping up with the appearance of the store is also important so the concrete floors was a turn off , at least acid stain it .
prices are not cheap , but by vegas standards are fairly reasonable .
and the best tortilla soup in town . great salsa as well .
my son had the madras curry bowl and it was amazing .
definitely my kind of joint . incredible atmosphere , fantastic music ( dj that night was playing eclectic funk , hip hop , glitch hop , and house ) , tapas were cool .
good prices . good food .
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
they had a lot of options with rolls , appetizers , and nigiri but the quality to me tasted cheap or unsatisfactory .
food was really good . however , i took a star away because the hostess was really rude and unaccommodating .
good drink selection as well .
the fish was cooked and deboned perfectly .
ordered a beer in the bottle as they only had the typical `` crap '' in my opinion on draft .
and mine was n't bad either , i had the chicken katsu noodles- but i definitely should have gotten the burger .
the view was definitely nice , if you get a table by the windows .
$ 10 tip included for what he had is a great value for money .
i kind of enjoy how tacky the taste in decoration is .
so good and at reasonable price !
not only did i stand and wait 10 min until someone acknowledged me , i saw them give my to go order to someone else !
finally we flagged down the hostess and asked for plates and a serving knife since it did n't have one and the pizza was really hot .
my friends and i shared a great bottle of reasonably priced malbec ( $ 30 ) as well as bruchetta .
first of all , they only have beer and wine , no liquor .
the paté to start was delicious , followed by the seafood platter .
regardless of that , i love coming here .
you ca n't beat the prices for full sized lunch portions . good atmosphere also .
everyone is super friendly , but are very slow .
good quality , tasty , and reasonably priced .
it was a drab design with pretty pathetic food .
the decor : redone house , great picture of baby lisa above the mantle , beautiful artwork by one of the staff members , and a totally dope patio .
sorry i can eat at hundreds of places that are worth that price in atmosphere alone .
margarita tasted good , but was a little weak , i stuck to beer after having one .
beers were ok , but they were bottled beers , so it would be pretty difficult for them to ruin that .
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
the prices were fair too .
our server was just ok. did n't seem to be a people person which is weird if you are a server .
just a cute farmhouse style shop for a chill day .
but the problem is we payed $ 5.25 for 3 and i was n't happy cause they were to small .
that day there was a lunch special on their watermelon margaritas which were good and refreshing on that hot day .
fantastic service , very friendly . the private booths make for a very nice atmosphere .
they all seem flustered and are brusque and impatient with the customers ordering their lunch .
kind of cheezy touristy decor but some of the other reviewers seemed to like it . struck me as kind of a applebees over decoration in mexican theme .
went there for a dinner special . order the set dinner for 2 at $ 290 , which comes to $ 340 plus 15 % tip .
absolutely disgusting . the place smells and it is so dirty , threw the food out after we picked it up .
the price was an outrageous hundred dollars for a brunch for two .
the margaritas were so weak i 'm not sure they even had tequila .
chicken plate - was over cooked and uninspired .
my favorite place to brunch after a long , alcoholic night !
it was n't cheap but not terribly expensive either ( $ 15- $ 20 per entree ) .
not saying service is bad he just made it that much better !
i do not consider the place pricey but more moderate .
i am more of a beer drinker than liquor drinker , and while there were only a few beers on tap , it was a good variety .
and was more then happy to fulfill my request for a sunrise ( kool aid with lemonade ) .
not sure who came up with the whacked cocktail menu but fortunately they have a good selection of craft beer on tap .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
if you like doing makeup , the lighting in the bathroom and entire room sucked .
the gimlet cocktail was my favorite of the ones ordered at our table .
sent back the chicken fried steak and received another one , but was still cold .
hopefully the staff will start caring about the quality of their food and some good ole fashioned pr .
i love eating at this place .
it 's friggin ugly inside and its like a maze getting from one place to another .
you can get a way better meal for $ 14 else where and katsu wise you can find cheaper .
make sure to order the calamari . it is cooked to perfection and has great seasoning on the coating .
our friends come here a lot and i guess it 's one of their favorite spots .
would have liked more than one of the karaoke books listed by artist .
most dishes are on the heavy side so feel free to share .
in concept the idea seems classy . in practice it 's creepy .
the portion sizes are really the only thing that justify spending money on the rather pricey menu .
the tuna maki was so terrible my boyfriend could not handle more than two bites ; it was tasteless and had been dyed red .
the food tasted horrible - i could taste it was all cooked in nasty grease that has n't been changed or cleaned .
the meats are also great and the sandwiches have a good amount on them .
ordered their pizza and the price is insanely high for what you get . for $ 36 got two personalized pizzas .
i got to be fair though , the food was good , except the kimchi was a little foul tasting .
the walls have splatter of food , there is trash on the ground , stains on the ground , and it just looks dirty .
i had a coupon for $ 1 off so it 's nice to save a little money too .
just for $ 50 for a breakfast that is less than $ 30 at other restaurant with good seasoning , i was n't impressed .
prices are pretty reasonable although juices are a bit too expensive .
the bathroom is dirty , dirty toilets , walls are nasty , no soap & the water barely trickles out if the faucet .
it was n't dense . it was a light muffin ... who would 've imagined it was possible ?
beers were $ 1 at the bar which rules , and they had some sort of hefeweizen that tasted good to me .
always a winner and fairly priced around $ 23 .
the florescent lights are not only stained , filthy and flashing , but also different colors .
they had about 15 beers on tap and they were pretty impressive .
a good selection of wine .
the lady taking my order seemed pretty indifferent and did not seem to care whether i was there or not .
expensive , to be sure , but worth doing at least once in your life .
awesome crepes . great choices even if you are vegetarian .
the service was very friendly and prompt .
what 's up with the uncomfortable metal chairs ?
the price was not justified at all .
we ate at midtown smokehouse earlier in the week and would strongly recommend it over this place .
pbr is very cheap and that is quite alright with me .
too many bad experiences and the food is not worth it & significantly lacks flavor unless you get a dish smothered in cheese .
weird layout for what should be a fancy place .
also they only had one riesling for the pay by the glass section and it was $ 9 when i can get the bottle for $ 13 at world market .
we ordered beers and were served some beer cocktail they were n't bad but i just wanted the beer not a cocktail .
and it 's not because she was mean , but because she never comes by .
it came with 5 small corn tortillas , i guess the idea was to have one piece of chicken for each tortilla , and get filled up on a heaping side of dry rice which tasted like it was a day old , and a heaping side of mediocre coleslaw .
mine was only $ 6 .
this place is great ! it 's probably my favorite place in huntersville to eat !
nothing fancy , though , and the walls and carpeting in the hallways were especially worn and in need of replacement .
i always have a pleasant experience when i go here .
the lighting throughout was a bit dim but not too dark to feel uncomfortable walking around .
it has a lot of meat and then noodle absorbed the taste really well .
the toilets in the men 's bathroom were filled to the top with urine and would not flush .
the price point is reasonable .
but i thought the beers were mediocre .
the prices are incredibly reasonable .
if they tasted better , they would have been a great deal , three large pieces of fish for about $ 16 bucks .
food and wine were excellent .
we ran a little over our 8:30 deadline but did n't feel pressured at all to eat fast .
the staff was very friendly and the location was well kept . over all great experience .
if you 're willing to pay about 400 $ for the whole menu to split then this is the place to go .
i also had two glasses of the white sangria so needless to say i really enjoyed that .
nice to have craft beer on tap and bottle . should n't be in a chilled glass though .
it is a great neighborhood bar . the patio is awesome and had live entertainment on the weekend .
the service is great , and food is a 9/10 for an indian restaurant . the naan was well cooked and biryani had excellent spices .
the fish and chips was fresh and delicious . the chicken batter was nice and crunchy and flavorful with the honey drizzle .
it is pretty good . the price is really reasonable .
those cherry peppers added just the right amount of heat , and the bacon ... yup , perfection .
food qty is always huge and quality is good .
we found this place a month ago and we have been here 4 times now and every time we try something different and it is so good .
the prices are reasonable .
the large patio is beautiful and inviting .
but minus 2 stars for having a creepy guy in the bathroom .
super crispy and also tender .
the steak was good for the price , it 's no jacobs , but a great value for $ 16 nonetheless .
the only reason to come is to drink beer out of the schooner glasses but alas they only have crap beer on tap .
perfectly tucked out of the way , just outside the city .
this all came to only $ 50 per person , which in most lv places similar , would be $ 100+ per person .
also make pitchers of cocktails ; we had the thai mojito which was pretty good .
first of all , they only have beer and wine , no liquor .
rice is aromatic and cooked at perfect texture , soaks up the sauces and goes soooooooooo well with the chicken and beef .
bathroom was pretty nice but it was a bit `` dirty '' ( overfilled trash baskets and stuff on floor ) .
the duck was tasty , the roast pork was crispy and delicious .
then my main entree came and it was cold ... .
home cooking with a hometown feel and for a party of 10 our bill was only $ 100 bucks .
good service and very reasonable prices .
$ 8 would be more reasonable .
this is my new favorite breakfast place in whitby .
the walls in the rooms seemed paper thin , the room itself felt dark and uninviting , and the resort itself is just so massive and lacking a flow pattern that it feels stale .
i ordered the caprese as an appetizer , which was so tasty , it must have been the balsamic vinaigrette they used . for my entree i chose the lasagne and it was perfect !
finally , after 10 to 15 minutes , she walked over and told me that only the manager can do refunds .
tonight we indulged in bryce 's `` special '' blood orange martini 's and a couple of appetizers .
she said that was the only way they sell it . that was really dumb !
the food was okay but nothing special .
went with some out of town friends who all loved it and are still raving about the experience .
john 's is our `` go-to '' breakfast place , especially in the winter when you ca n't sit outdoors anyway .
the food was a huge ball of salt . very salty and horrible .
i do n't drink but they had a huge selection of wine and beer .
save your money for another place . $ 15 for one margarita , so $ 16 for unlimited sounds great but they fail to say not premium liquor .
that made their customer service terrible .
she was all business and it was clear that she was only there to take our order and fill our drinks .
they have amazing drinks .
they have only a few beers on tap , a pretty good choice of bottled beer and a basic bar stock .
prices are pretty reasonable , and generally the food is quite good .
price was super reasonable , we ended up spending about $ 50 each , but that 's with drinks , all of those rolls and a 25 % tip .
prices very reasonable for the high quality of food .
until we came to check in ... the two women we encountered at the desk were beyond rude .
excellent service from natalie , very informative and attentive , without being `` stuffy '' .
any time a server delivers your margarita with , `` i 'm a terrible bartender because i like drinking too much .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
this restaurant has happy hour all day long and each item was no more than $ 8 !
they lost another star for something i hate ; they brought out all the food at almost the same time .
the meat was tough and chewy and again did not taste fresh .
i do n't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible .
such a delightful experience all round ! our group went for the tasting menu and recommended wine parings with each course .
i love this place for good food and cheap prices .
however , i hated the interior design of the restaurant .
rude staff , bad service , and lousy food . very disappointing .
durant 's has been open since the 40 's so it had a really cool vibe to it .
perfectly fried with just enough grease to be good and not enough to be gross .
the place was only 1/3 full but they still gave us the `` do you have a reservation ? ''
my friend also had moved on from the beer to the hibiscus wine cooler and it was super yummy .
let 's not even discuss the thin walls or `` blackout '' curtains .
entrance is kind of odd , just a heads up .
they still did n't have anything on draft but a good bottle selection .
pricey tacos are good , just pricey . i am a real fan of the atmosphere , it 's like hipster before hipster was cool which made it not cool .
i am always looking for a good place to take relatives from out of town .
the bar food is fantastic and outrageously cheap .
the service is great and music was nice .
giving them two stars just coz the interior is sort of cute .
service was impeccable from start to finish , and the atmosphere was warm and chic . my guest ordered a wonderful ( if a little over-priced ) cocktail and i had a craft beer on tap ( always appreciated ) .
she then asked if i would like to come in on monday and i again told her i wanted to come in right away for the correction .
easily one of our new favorite breakfast spots .
i know it 's meant to be cute and quirky , but the mismatched chairs and the combination of decor elements made it feel very cluttered and disorganized and like something did n't look quite right .
we got the wrong bill and waited forever to get a chance to pay it .
will never eat at this restaurant again and advise anyone who does to ensure they are only charged once for their meal . it is a shame that the friendly staff and wonderful food at savor cafe are not enough to compensate for their horrible business practices .
sadly , i just really did not like the pizza .
tasty food . great prices .
for chicken pot i was expecting clear chicken broth , but it was not .
the pastries are also great , and they are baked fresh in the mornings .
they only had a few beers on tap , and none that were particularly exciting .
no problem there - but the system asks for tip up front - we thought it only gives you three options for tip , which is requested before any service or any food to taste.. odd .
it 's a refreshing change from the chains and franchises , it 's a family business , so it 's a labor of love .
the service is great and the owners always walk around and talk to you .
we come here at least once a month now : )
i felt happy with the free unlimited wine provided .
they just mark up the price 3+ times to cover the cost of decoration and totally worthless !
this place . i love this place .
and did i mention that the margarita was very weak ? i think the bartender forgot the tequila .
everything was very fresh .
we started off with a drink at the bar . i appreciated the ice in the rail to keep the drinks cold .
she didnt bother asking if the food was good or if we needed anything else .
ambiance - a bit sad given the fluorescent lighting and location but i suppose you ca n't do much about it ¯\_ ( ツ ) _/¯
there was no apology , and in fact , i 'm a bit sad at the way he made me feel as if i was bothering him .
it would be a restaurant that i will highly recommend to friends and family .
crispy , but not dry .
really liked it and very reasonably priced .
$ 2.50 for a soda ? the total for this lunch was $ 15 .
the spicy chicken really enjoy the marinade they had it in and the flavors came out once grilled it .
very nice bottle of wine and the meal was very good .
only issue was the lighting .
maybe it is the odor of fresh carpet ( weird because it is n't carpeted ) but it is super dark in there .
weird that the men 's one person bathroom has a big gap in the door .
the stove area is dirty a lot when asked to clean it up the pretend the did not understand .
it is definitely consider high end fine dining on the strip so you must expect to pay the price . nobu is not a place to dine if you are on a budget .
my salad was very fresh .
it was kind of bland , and dry .
it was monday night , ladies night , and they had fantastic dinner and $ 5 drink specials .
the prices are n't that cheap and this place is a dump .
the drinks were pretty cheap ( wine , beer , margs ) but i do n't think they had any coors or bud on tap , which is unusual .
this place is also crazy expensive .
we like the chain but this location is so poor that we are unlikely to return .
the bottomless fries were thin , hard and almost stale ... this is out of the norm as a year ago this place was actually pretty good , not now .
very nice and modern style dining area , looks fantastic .
i liked the rice , but not the chicken .
good beer at amazing prices compared to the strip .
decor is cool but noisy .
well ... the makers mark was served with a glass full of ice , which is n't neat at all .
my wife ordered a pinot noir and i opted for simple coke ( i 'm a cheap date . )
in fact , nearly everything at this one is more bland than others .
meh . it tasted like an oreo but 10 times more expensive .
i brought it to the managers attention he proceeded to tell us that he was letting the waiter go for the rest of the day because of the dirty cup .
only 12 or 16 inch . a little pricey depending on what you get.. they do have good deals though
they have an awesome martini with st. germain and gin - love it ! i also love the flatbread pizza and the wine list .
so $ 53 for what amounted to some mediocre appetizers .
a hip spot run by cool cats .
i 'm glad paying customers rank lower than wiping a table off .
price is n't bad too , cause for the price i paid is pretty decent for the quality and quantity of the food we got .
excellent wine by the glass .
very good lunch specials and much less expensive than the alternative .
the service was really good and the price was not bad for an airport . i ordered wings and unfortunately they were fatty ... the flavor was good but definitely not something i would ever order again .
before i knew it there was the stage showcasing some new cars . it was pretty cool .
it 's also pretty pricy .
it smells horrible , your shoes stick to the ground , there 's broken glass everywhere that they do n't clean up , it 's wall to wall people : so basically a huge fire hazard .
very nice and they checked in appropriately .
it looked like something pulled from the freezer and heated up , then topped with a refrigerator cold onion marmalade .
suggestion to management : fire your lame staff and get some decent employees .
they do have a full bar but no beer on tap .
after getting our drinks we did n't see our waiter for about 20 minutes . in total , we saw our waiter maybe 4 times during our dinner .
that chicago dog tasted great with everything on it . great crunch and the dog itself had that great firm texture .
i love this place and i 'm very picky when it comes to thai food and the staff is always nice ! plus they deliver and i live on the strip !
there 's a large bar with a vast array of wines in stock and a small second floor where the choir most likely used to sit .
almost everything tasted homemade and the environment is fun and inviting ! everything comes out very hot and fresh !
it was $ 38 for the two of us , which i do n't imagine is normal .
good drink prices too .
people are great , friendly , and knowledgeable .
not overwhelmed at all . lobster was overcooked , steak was dry and was a terrible cut , margarita was water ( it was supposed to be a cadillac too ) and service was decent but nothing spectacular .
when we got there they were running 45 minutes behind . when we went to the bar , it took over 30 minutes to get drinks .
i ordered to go , there were only 3 people working 2 cooking and 1 running the register and she was also running food to patrons . they were very busy , the lady who helped me was very nice and apologized for the wait .
the decoration is pretty much random .
this is easily my favorite date night .
god , it 's so shockingly ugly inside here .
it be nice if i got a `` can you move '' or `` watch out ice coming '' no i got the most rudest thing ever .
it seemed as though everyone was confused about who should wait on our table .
and , i love the new location !
we had a couple of the signature cocktails that were just wonderful -- not too sweet , but complex and utterly drinkable .
this looked like such a nice place to dine right next to the fountain .
there 's a small potted ( real ) plant sitting on the bench , which is kind of cute .
it was very inviting - they had the football games on and it was lively and happy but not too crazy or loud .
we made 3 qualifying purchases to receive $ 7 off of appetizers ( $ 21 off total ) and none of these were reflected either .
prices are on the high side , so be prepared to pay up .
however , the portions are fair small for something over $ 15 after tax and tip . while it is tasty and trendy , i 'm not sure if the price point is worth it for me .
prices are high and you pay for sides .
but shrimp aside , the dish did n't wow me .
we were in las vegas and i was so excited to see this place near our hotel .
loud ass hell , laughing off the top of their lungs , and just hanging out in large numbers blocking walkways .
ladies , careful when wearing heels ... the floor is slick , or maybe it 's how i walk .
their specials are awesomely priced , and very tastey .
my mexican pizza looked super weird and was inedible .
and the worst of all , the `` chef '' placed raw chicken right next to cooked fish on the grill , handling with same spatula . disgusting .
the bar area is kind of small but nice as well .
it also gives a very good value for the money you pay for food .
good food , a great deal . the drive kept us from enjoying this as often as we should have .
excellent food for about an average cost ... not too expensive , but definitely worth it !
make sure to visit their oktoberfest celebration . bring your own liter steins and dance to the music of a live band .
two plump , juicy , flavorful chicken breast fried golden brown were served over 4 belgian waffles and topped with fried leeks with a maple reduction and spicy chili oil with diced bell peppers .
good beer selection with the opportunity to order pitchers rather than just pints .
the skin was kind of soggy and greasy .
disappointed they did n't have liquor but only wine or beer - had to order sangria .
the only disappointment was the food .
decor is nice , but the only thing that bothers me about this place is the fact that there are circle prints on the walls .
they were good but not quite $ 30 good .
our most frequent go-to date night place : ) highly recommend this place !
good food and reasonable prices .
what i feel that 's lacking though is the atmosphere . there 's no one to greet you at the front when you walk in so it feels like you 're intruding on a private party , the decor is sparse and not at all cozy .
the honey garlic chicken is top drawer !
the room itself is super modern and huge and clean -- the bathroom itself is bigger than my own bedroom in nyc , and the beds are like supported clouds .
nobody wanted to take my order and i was sent to three different people to take my order .
great value for the price too .
location is weird , but makes sense with the religious theme .
the food is n't stand-out but the drinks are pretty good , and the building and environment makes it a super fun happy hour spot ! it 's built in an old church with stained glass windows in midtown !
spinach and pepperoni are a good marriage in a pizza . the crust ... amazing .
prices are more than reasonable considering the quality and care put into the food .
the chicken parmesan was moist and tender .
i have been coming here for over a year and i honestly feel like this is one of the best sushi bars in vegas !
over excellent value . good fresh and hot food in good quantity .
always great kabob . very friendly and attentive staff .
when you order a chicken off the menu and it costs $ 23 you 'd expect more than a single breast .
service was super quick .
but , one guy , a belly full of beer , one pizza , and a bill of $ 60 ?
this is good food . weird setting , like fake european versailles but at least the food was great !
i love the coffee and the service is always great ! the patio is also a nice place to relax on a nice day .
i was a bit disappointed that they did n't have draught beer but enjoyed the selection of cans and bottles .
he then turned to the rest of us and told us they were at full capacity and would no longer be taking tables .
and delicious drinks ( i tried the clyde ) .
or $ 21 for 10. got 10 because i could n't see paying $ 8 for only three .
the decor is tacky but thats what i love about this place .
even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it .
but it is never good when you leave a buffet that is $ 41 per person and you think to yourself i would have rather had a happy meal .
great take out place . i 've been visiting pearl wok for a number of years due to review from newspaper .
the drinks were decent though there were no beers on tap , only in cans . selection was ok though .
kids size , salads , and tons of options , including roasted garlic , eight kinds of cheese , and loads of veggies and even gluten free crust option .
they also seemed to have a decent selection of wine and beer .
i have iced tea , which was good .
we did decide to indulge in drinks , i had the st. francis merlot ( $ 12 ) very full bodied and full glass .
a gorgeous space w/ a sexy combo of rustic & chic .
the atmosphere of the shop can be kind of awkward because of the bad lighting and awkward silences .
the wait staff was almost nonexistent ... our menus were left on the table after we ordered , our dirty dishes were left on the table after we ate , we waited a very long time to get the check , and the bathrooms were pretty filthy too .
good food and great atmosphere . only complaint - the food was not hot enough ( fire hot ) for my taste .
pretty quick and reasonably priced .
just make sure you take a good look because it 's definitely hidden .
the burger is dry and tasteless .
pros : surprisingly , this was an indoor venue instead of outdoor , and it seemed more like a large beer hall with lots of old world decor , which took some of the disappointment out of being confined indoors on such a beautiful day .
even if there had been more chicken , the flavor was just horrible ...
fantastic friendly restaurant in baby point .
happy hour at firebirds must haves : the double black diamond ; fresh pineapple infused for 21 days with lemon vodka , and the passion basil mule ; a delicious spin on the traditional moscow mule . the lobster spinach queso is by far our favorite starter to share !
there were several types of different ethnic foods , salads , pizza , chicken , beef and my favorite part of the buffet , the desserts .
a family operation and , right down to grandma and the grandchildren , everyone is super nice .
cramped but in a good way .
the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the food .
their rolls are over sized to huge ! so 2 soups and 3 rolls are more than enough for a big lunch or dinner for 2. many original and very tasty rolls to choose from !
they also make great drinks .
the drinks were great .
the $ 15 hamburger was dried out and tasteless .
portion is decent for one person , but nearly $ 15 after tax .
only thing was the seating this time , i felt the lighting was terrible , like i was in an interrogation room .
considering the price it was well worth the trip here at only $ 43 for dinner price
it tasted pretty good .
and for a fair price !
it was cooked perfectly and was super tasty .
the prices are very reasonable- check the specials .
dinner hours are super loud too , given the turnout , so maybe not the best place for romantic date conversation .
great food at reasonable prices . the drinks are also very good .
it 's great to try the different cuts and varieties of steaks , pork , lamb and chicken .
good , clean establishment . they are always busy .
my big problem was the ambience ... dusty dried flowers and picture frames ... filthy carpet , and do not use the restroom .
our waiter was friendly & attentive .
the beer is cheap but the beer is also awful ; my boyfriend drinks a lot of beer and we went on national beer day .
the place is bright and happy in a rustic yet artsy kind of way .
fyi the glasses of sangria are huge !
the cheese is probably the worst part though .
they have a good happy hour and many of the signature rolls are offered at a great price the only negative is the music is loud that can also be fun but if you are there to have conversations go early
call me snobby , but one has to have something to spread on the scone as you sit and sip on a nice cup of coffee or tea .
i was not automatically offered the free drink , i had to ask for it .
we started with margaritas , both strawberry , and both tasted like sugar , and we were not sure if there was any alcohol in the drinks .
the only down slide to this hotel is how expensive it can get and that i found the cleaning to not be at par sometimes .
prices for dinner are ridiculous and the food quality is terrible .
they were alright but waiting an hour for one order of dessert is ridiculous .
thought the name meant beer or good drinks . beers were pricey .
i get the whole car shop theme but it looks dirty and trashy .
they do have a full bar but no beer on tap .
but $ 9 for a burger that i can buy for $ 5 in a cafe somewhere ... i 'm not very impressed .
we both agreed that the food was just entirely flavorless and under-seasoned , which was shocking based on all of the other reviews .
a 20 % restocking fee on an off the shelf item is unrealistic .
i did no drink one , but apparently the margaritas were pretty good and not a bad deal by the pitcher .
i was pleasantly surprised with the appetizer . we had the thai calamari with wasabi .
simply not good food ... tasted like the salad came directly out of the fridge and my taco was just spicy - no flavour . did n't feel like any love was put into the food .
and if the presentation was n't enough , the taste was incredible too . each piece was absolutely well balanced , tasty and tender .
only thing was i know the lighting is for ambiance and what not but its hard to read the menu with the lights so dim .
the girls had skinny margaritas that came in what looked like `` toy '' glasses and had hardly any tequila .
the lights kept getting dimmer and dimmer so all of a sudden i was deaf and blind : p food is so-so .
the lighting inside is very dim , to the point of almost using my cell phone light to read the menu .
when i say drinks i mean sodas - no special bar drink or something .
loved the indoor ambience and country music too .
unfortunately , no bud light lime on tap so we just drank regular beer .
that drink was strong !
i have been a regular at this place for the past year or so and this place is great ! the staff is friendly and the food is awesome .
maybe it 's not filthy - maybe it 's just the lighting and decor that makes it look like that way .
told them swipe did n't work on my card so she had to type in was to lazy just sent me away will never go back . terrible service and very rude and lazy .
and the drinks made perfectly .
great food , simple place , nice people . reasonably priced .
the soup was very bland , barely any flavor , and was way too expensive !
i have to say we were a table of 4 plus a toddler who did n't order , not a large party , but at least she was honest about the mistake .
got ta say this place was a great little find .
in total , about $ 21 .
fast , tasty , reasonable price .
on top of that , the bathroom was filthy .
the beef was pretty good , a lot like eating a beef dip sandwich without he bun . veggies on the plate were the usual , a bit soggy and flavour challenged .
the special was okay but it was a little expensive i thought . it was about $ 14 .
overall , for the price you pay , which was about $ 29 or so after taxes , it 's still a pretty good buy .
still a very large dive bar with plenty of places to sit .
service was pretty horrible so that is really what is keeping me away ... .dont get me wrong the girl was super sweet but just bad at her job .
they have a decent draft beer selection , and even more in bottles .
prices are so reasonable , excellent place for lunch .
the price is average but i do n't mind paying for food that i want to taste great .
this location has a great patio to enjoy when the weather is nice .
the eggs were tasteless , dry and ice cold .
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
but i love the atmosphere , by atmosphere i mean the latin concepts and hustle and bustle of the staff .
also worth noting , you never hear any pedestrian traffic . no weird mall conversations to ruin the atmosphere .
very nice deck seating as well .
when i picked up my pizza she was clearly unhappy with me pointing out this error .
a definite must and truly enjoyed my first meal in phoenix
the smoked kielbasa that came with my plate was delicious !
since then , i have taken my good friend , who is vegan , to this bakery whenever we hang out .
very friendly staff and beautiful space .
the hostess has a poor personality .
good service . comfortable seating .
it was replaced with another draft beer that was n't that great either .
food is cheap but good quality .
i was n't impressed . i mean , the food was just `` eh '' my sandwich fell apart .
good selection of beer , wine ... not at all .
it was reasonably priced and quick too .
it is outrageously good .
draft beer was not as cold as it should be , order bottles . crappy music .
for the almost $ 40 dish , i thought it was a little underwhelming . i expected the meat to be awesome but it was ok. there was some fatty parts and some flavor which made it delicious , but other parts were just plain .
really good portions for the price you pay .
cheap and hearty breakfast food ! pretty good stuff , especially for the reasonable prices .
when you add in all of the tattoos , nose rings , ear discs and other face jewelry it just gives a trashy look to an otherwise beautiful restaurant .
i had a fish combination plate and it tasted like it was full of sodium . not impressed .
the cocktails are all pretty sweet - i 'll try whiskey next time .
beer was ok , but not quite cold enough . nice bartender but a second bartender was needed .
food was excellent - fresh and healthy preparation .
i do n't know why , but the entrance feels weird , like its cluttered or just too confined .
some must order items include the pomme frites , steamed bun , prince edward island mussels ( my hands down favorite ) , and shrimp arepas .
the sliders were fine but the fries seemed a lil cold considering it was the last thing ordered .
pricing ranges under 10 bucks which is amazing considering the portion that is given .
my sushi was alright . seaweed salad had a funky taste to it , definitely did n't seem fresh . my boyfriends salad was the real disappointment .
the price was very reasonable .
my boyfriend had already gotten and eaten all of his food before they brought my sushi out , and there were only 3 other groups seated in the restaurant ! the waitress apologized in passing but at that point i was very hungry and frustrated , especially when it came to footing the bill as they took a while to bring that over , too .
she was extremely apologetic and sweet and was not one of the many staff who were standing around .
everything we ordered was extremely fresh and the flavors were delicious .
the prices are high , but here you get what you pay for .
disappointed they did n't have liquor but only wine or beer - had to order sangria .
decently priced at $ 30 , pretty good fot being at the cosmopolitan .
i ordered two different drinks - a pina colada and another fruity drink .
this is perfect for large parties - even on a very busy night , it does n't get too loud ( aka , you can still hold a conversation without shouting ) .
my mister tried the herbal lemonade , which was more my speed and very refreshing .
the owners are always so nice , which makes me happy as a return customer .
the sauces they have rival other places , especially the chimichuri sauce .
the price is a little bit expensive but highly recommended !
well all of the tables were dirty but we sat and waited for someone to greet us .
paired with some specialty saki , the food was lovely .
beer was good too and they even had drinks even if do n't drink beer .
their eggs bennie are the best in the city , and their foie gras is just too good . the wine list is pretty good , even their quick selections are delicious .
oh yeah ; and i almost forgot if you 're going to use the restroom as a guy , the urinal is one giant cast-iron bathtub ... it 's hilarious : - )
i pretty much stick to my beer basics so i ordered a corona bottle .
i like korean a lot and even if this was supposed to be a fusion it was n't good .
the price is reasonable on some items .
i got chicken tips the same thing i got last time , and last time they were juicy and delicious today cold , flavorless , dry , and had chunks of fat still on them .
the sausage though is delicious !
i ca n't pinpoint it , unless it 's just that hotel bars swarmed with people wearing name badges are low key depressing .
really nice atmosphere as well .
a large fountain cup ( unusual for a julep but whatever ) , a decent shot ( meh ) , a bunch of fresh mint ( good ) , the large cup filled with ice to the degree that we had to pour some out to get at the bourbon .
wings were great ! only 3 stars because the customer service was horrible .
ambiance- very nice upscale place .
this place is amazing ! we came for lunch and everything was so delicious and of course we had to order crab deep
hand crafted cocktails were excellent but a bit overpriced for an off strip bar beer taps were down for repair but there were ipas and other bottle and canned options .
my holy alkaline is amazing and my co-workers watermelon mint with super berry boost in both were a juicing persons dream .
service was quick and the prices are fairly reasonable .
we received excellent service at fatz ! our server was very attentive and friendly .
it 's kind of dark and depressing .
especially if they reserve the right to charge $ 12 a pound for uneaten food .
awesome food . fresh and delicious .
combined with a tall beer made for a great meal .
very reasonably priced for the quality of food that you get .
if i did n't live so far away from this place it would be a regular eatery for my family .
chips are hot and fresh .
i do n't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible .
it 's good food for a great price .
i do n't mind the cost but this was extremely overpriced for the value and quality .
i could n't taste the fish at all . was kind of fried rice sushi .
i got a tea and it was delicious , a berry iced tea , i loved it !
prices are good and you get a lot of value .
delicious food . husband loved the chocolate cannoli , i was a fan triple chocolate cheesecake and my sister enjoyed the chocolate mousse .
service was horrible ! starting with the host experience , not pleasant .
the dumplings are perfect . the wrap is tender and the fillings are flavorful .
the whole thing only lasts about 19 seconds . and since it only lasts about 19 seconds , $ 120 really is n't worth it .
so for the price point , this place is pretty darn good .
the grilled pork looked pre prepared and was small pieces , not like the grilled strips of pork i 've had elsewhere . the eggrolls were disappointing as well .
apparently they only know how to pour beers and make margaritas .
especially for the price !
i highly recommend that everyone who visits toronto goes to this restaurant .
although do find it really weird to see one of my hindu gods displayed in a venue filled with drunk scantily clad people .
beer and wine yes , hard booze no .
the food was decent and you get a decent amount for what you pay .
there are no decorations on the bland walls .
we already love charleston 's for their food and service but they were able to accommodate my huge family and brittany and kevin did a wonderful job ! i 've been a server for many years and they did a top notch job dealing with such a large group .
nice workers , nice atmosphere , thumbs up . go here for great food .
we heard some good things from friends .
great vibes overlooking pools and cabanas . palms place is the residence away from the strip .
only complaint is the pricey food but i guess you get what you pay for .
- fried green tomatoes with pork belly and pimento cheese : tomatoes were freaking fantastic - crisp and sweet !
i called ahead to ask if they had wifi and the girl told me yes . when i got here another girl said they do have wifi but its for employees only.. i was n't sure why that would be the case and i asked to talk to the manager if and why that 's true .
the skewers were amazing i love all the flavor combos with the chickpeas and the crepes .
i recommend grabbagreen food & juice to anyone and everyone who enjoys great quality food/drinks and great customer service .
the service was amazing , could n't have asked for anything better .
we were pleasantly surprised at how reasonably-priced the bar menu was and had the meatballs and the fries with garlic aioli along with two glasses of wine each -- we got out for under $ 50 which was perfect for a happy hour .
we sat at the bar and tracy was a doll , she made us the green tea margaritas and the cucumber cocktail perfectly , one of the best cocktails we have had since we got here .
seems like it would create a really cool indoor/outdoor vibe .
yes , their menu is overpriced , but you have decent lunch specials .
this place is great !
reasonably priced for the quality .
this is an excellent establishment .
had the signature meat in a burrito and it was excellent . amazing flavors with just the right amount of spice .
instead it reminds me of an attempt at a retro diner that they did n't get quite right ... with the obnoxious multi-colored tile on the walls and the bad curtains ?
she was asked twice to get a drink and finally some other waiter brought me my drink .
the beer prices are reasonable .
lovely views , great ambiance , food and service .
the cheeseburgers were very dry and overcooked , but the short ribs on the bottom of the burger was pretty good . too bad it was a very tiny piece of short ribs .
in terms of quality , price , and time , i consider this place a ripoff . decent food , but unreasonably expensive .
tasty dishes , the grilled mackerel is delish ! chicken wings are pretty awesome too .
great music , big space , tall ceilings , communal seating , and lots of great meat !
the drink menu is great . i love the lychee and pear martinis and the cold unfiltered sake .
drink was mixed pretty well but getting the waiter to come back within 15 minutes is near impossible . would have ordered an appetizer but the fact that he took that long made us decide not to .
would 've liked to see some drafts but nonetheless , the bottled beer selection was great .
the beer is cold and i have mixed drinks about feelings .
the prices were reasonable too .
otherwise it 's awkward .
they even have full lobsters but the time i had it they were quite dry . the crab legs more than made up for it though .
honestly , all we wanted was to get a piece of lobster that would n't cost us an arm and a leg and that did n't require us to dress up ... .
only after we complained did they offer a discount .
the restaurant layout was totally weird but who really cares .
how about cutting it in half and charging $ 8 or $ 10 ?
they even have an outdoor bar area with one of those trendy garage doors .
it was gothic , creepy , but strangely noisy .
the third order finally came out , which was a cinnamon roll , and it had to be reheated since it was cold .
unfortunately , they have no beers .
overall a good value for the price . average sushi , very good happy hour prices .
i 'm kind of creeped out sitting at a table and seeing how dirty the booths are , even in the very dim lighting .
i kinda liked them ... they were served barely warm .
so normally this place has top notch service , today it was at a tortoise pace .
they had a nice selection of wine .
as i waited i could overhear others asking for the brisket and being told the sad news . the bad part was the employee watched them stare at the menu for many minutes without giving them the heads-up that they were out of brisket so back to the menu they went .
the consistency from piece to piece was not good .
the outside of the building is hardly impressive , and the neighborhood is wanting ... although , the interior has a nice clean , warm , modern feel .
the coleslaw was n't bad either . all in all it was an ok meal but the craving i had for it kind of faded when i was eating it .
poor quality steak and ribs ( the meat was tough and the flavor was blah ) .
pizza is great and the service is excellent at this location . every time we go here , i 'm impressed by their friendliness and attentiveness .
huge disappointment this was our worst thanksgiving day meal ever .
i also tried my friends ' drinks- moscow mule and the margarita , both better than the other cocktails but nothing very special .
i placed my order and then i had to wait about 20min to get my food even though i was the only one in the restaurant .
and this my yelp friends is so accurate .
i had the chicken sandwich and kale salad . tasty .
the decor is tacky , the waitstaff tired , and the food dreadful .
bummer the full wine list was n't on special .
after about ten minutes of me standing and waiting for one taco , while the rest of mine and my wife 's dinner got cold , a manager finally approached the counter and asked what i was waiting for .
the environment is wonderful for dining and chatting with people you actually like .
was surprised to see $ 5 guac , but would rather pay $ 9 somewhere else .
while neither my husband or i drink beer , they look like they have a good selection of bottled and draft beers .
the atmosphere was casual and the setting of the dinner is like formal but not too formal , it 's dim but not too dark or bright .
i found the highly recommended sashimi to be overpowered by the sauce and the garlic chips .
fast , cheap , decent .
this place offers great food and an amazing view of the lake .
also we tried to order dos equis on draft but there was something wrong with the tap that made it taste like a completely different beer .
the prices are super reasonable .
okay so i feel bad for the people who do n't walk around the corner from the bellagio lobby and happen upon the flowing chocolate fountain and smell of fresh crepes and nutella !
also , the price is pretty high for a fast food place .
this restaurant is a true gem , keep up the great work !
they had about 15 beers on tap and they were pretty impressive .
could it be the hiring of cheap young inexperienced managers will ruin this chain too ?
we had an awesome waiter who was very attentive and the food we had was awesome !
awesome . the meatballs are really good .
: -p the omelette was yummy , the pancake was pretty good but i actually needed to use a tiny bit of syrup for each bite cuz it seemed to lack the intensity i had remembered .
they have huge creamy crab salad sushi in them .
after waiting for 10 minutes she starts making it with 0 urgency and she did n't make it right anyway .
i hate going to locations where everything tastes the same and bland .
the lighting was n't too bright or too dim , just right .
my husband had a sake , and i tried their signature samba juice , both drinks were very good .
the quality is good for the price !
be sure to stop by for a great meal in vegas .
we visited eddie v 's last saturday for my birthday dinner and were really looking forward to a great evening , unfortunately that did not happen .
this place is `` good '' there was n't anything extraordinary about it , but there was n't anything terrible about it either .
not a bad meal for under $ 15 !
great food selection , and decent prices .
fresh made buns and pork and salad are really remarkable . quick and super tasty .
pretty good wine selection i guess , i 'm not a wine guy . not much of a beer selection for being a beer and wine bar .
not expensive at all .
also the food is great and love the drinks and shots .
the last layer was a flavorful fake meat ( soy based ) in a tomato sauce .
the manager kayla was very nice but the owner sucks for not doing the right thing .
very nice staff and cool space .
the service was very slow and the server did n't know the difference between a draft and bottled beer .
the strawberry slush was the perfect ending to my meal .
mother 's day had a special with salad , pasta , chicken , stuffed salmon and the titanic for dessert .
when you pay top dollar you should get a good pour .
i do n't mean to sound pretentious ( oh well ... ) but the flavor was not there , the food tasted like something i could have made in my slow cooker at home , but less flavorful . so disappointed !
the bad news : the lighting was horrible , so bright you did n't even notice there were candles on the table .
went there and although the wings were good , the service was awful . had to stand up and find our waiter multiple times to place drink orders and get more food .
i prefer chicago hot dogs , but last week w/ coupon i had to try a specialty hot dog : chilean , including a free waffle ice cream . i am glad that i tried it .
prices are reasonable as well .
the mango margarita was strong so i only had one .
to start the bar tender recommended the house sangria , fruity and really good .
ed was very helpful in explaining the menu and made our meal experience great !
the wait staff needs to manage expectations on wait times better . do n't say `` it 's a 10 minute wait to be seated '' when it 's really 30. do n't say `` your food is coming right out '' only for an additional 20 minutes to go by food is decent , if you decide to stick around long enough .
it was in a weird thai curry which i was n't too fond of .
disappointing all around . beer was ho-hum .
bring a bottle of wine and enjoy great food and great conversation !
the best sushi happy hour in town ! always fresh sushi and super cold beer !
the staff is great , always tentative and super helpful .
the butter was still cold on the cold hard toast .
duck is $ 12 . 95 absolutely incredible and the whole duck is $ 24 if you go to the store a whole duck is going to cost you $ 20 or more !
service was awful and food took forever to come out .
the lighting was a bit dim , but still enough light that i was n't squinting .
the food here was mostly stale and bland .
the prices on a saturday morning were ridiculously high , over $ 21 dollars for 2 people for terrible food and slow service .
the ambience is very nice , classy , and intimate .
drink needed a bit more alcohol , but hey , it was free !
i would easily pay 10.00 a pizza if they had better ingredients .
but all food was mediocre ( hash brown looked like it came scooped out of a can ) and all of it was cold .
for $ 3 , i guess that would be reasonable for any bun .
i am glad we did !
it was delicious and so much food for under $ 20 .
we sat on the patio and it was very nice with lights around on the trees .
they were full of roasted chicken with a lovely jalapeño cream sauce .
i will say that the drink selection was good and they had some good beers on tap .
it was dry and not good .
the bus boy was very friendly though .
excellent service and very clean .
the food was decent but not justifiable for the price .
ordered the brisket ( fatty ) , which was almost too fatty for my taste , but it still had great flavor .
i also went there for mac and cheese week , which was absolutely excellent . they did not cheap out on the cheese selection for their dish and it was absolutely delicious .
great place , the food is amazing and the owner armando really care about his customers ! 5 starts armando
quite expensive in my opinion .
if ever a place deserved it ... typical bad tourist food with a dash of bad attitude . do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere .
it 's a very cool atmosphere and always busy .
out came this tiny drink , not even that great .
have seen some interesting stuff and shows here favorite part is showing up before a bigger concert and just seeing the bands hang out and have a drink or two and getting to mingle .
the most disappointing thing though was that i could n't taste the tequila in my margarita and when i ordered two more shots to add the bartender got offended . would never recommend
i stopped here today for a quick healthy lunch . i remember eating at freshii 's when i visited houston a few months ago and enjoyed it so i was excited to see this healthy alternative to fast food in pittsburgh .
i did n't try a lot of the dish but from what i had tried , it was n't that bad .
the prices are reasonable too .
the parisian style patio opens to college st. and it is very good for people watching .
great food , reasonable prices .
love the variety of food here !
service is friendly . ambiance is very casual with sports decor .
if you are not familiar with a arepa it is a tasty cornmeal cake kind of like a small pita that can be fried , baked or grilled .
this place was just weird and creepy .
very disappointed and a $ 100 check .
the only item i did n't care for at all was the albondigas soup . it was very bland .
it 's so awkward and uncomfortable and all conversation is obliterated by the sound .
it 's a great place to bring your family .
the toronto elite enjoy cocktails , wine , and aperitifs . excellent drinks with homemade juices .
staff was super friendly and helpful . nitro coffee was excellent .
she said she had to bring us bill for our drinks ( which was water ) and cancel our order ( she still had n't taken it to kitchen ) she seemed very confused once again . my husband politely reminded her we only had water & we left .
i 'm all about cocktails - they make good manhattans , whiskey sours and martinis
we sat there at the sushi bar for 20mins staring at our menu 's and by the time the waitress came by we had to return to the office so didnt have a chance to try the food . not a great revue sorry but if you are in a rush better try somewhere else ... dave t .
it 's just awkward .
took awhile to order our drinks . once our server came over , he provided good suggestions and mentioned that we should order 7-8 pieces per person ( we had 4 in our group ) .
the pizza was pretty good !
beautiful place to have fun with space to eat or study as well .
the mexican chopped salad i ordered was not great . it was basically a cold garden salad with a few pieces of corn and beans and dry chicken .
pricing was also reasonable as well .
the food and drinks are fantastic . and the happy hour deals are phenomenal .
the margarita was weak but ok and there is no way to screw up a cold corona !
sure lady , come shower in our room ... not . if it were n't for the bad area we would stay there again .
the drinks are perfect .
it was a warmer day and a corona sounded good , however , they had a decent craft beer selection and full bar .
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
the fireside lounge is pretty unique and the restaurant is tastefully ornate .
the small plates concept is sooo perfect for any foodie like myself because you can try so many of their varied and delicious menu items .
decently price to be honest .
i was hoping this place would n't be good , but much to my dismay the orange chicken was surprisingly tasty ( the portions are minuscule , though ) .
no good beers on tap or bottle , so i ordered water .
the value is good .
kind service and excellent cocktail , i love the taste of mescal in my shaken and up drink .
the servers are lovely . the martinis are to die for !
super crispy fries and just enough of that sweet bite from the bbq sauce .
when the waiter asked how much i like the food , i told him how i felt . surprisingly , he took the matter seriously , talked to the kitchen at once , and insisted to give our table a free dessert .
i gorged on both land and sea lol .
we have had pretty much everything on the menu and it is always hot and very tasty .
we are so lucky to get lost and found this place .
luckily the rest of the competent and friendly wait staff took our order and generally took care of us so my lunch companion was able to make her after lunch appointment otherwise it would have been a disaster .
really cool eating atmosphere !
the mojito and cosmopolitans were perfectly made .
$ 15 for a med sub , chips and soda ? i got charged twice for chips this place sucks & the sub was n't that creative nor great safeway has better sandwiches for under $ 6
the tables on the patio could use a comfort upgrade - maybe some high tops ?
they told me that an equivalent meal in phoenix would have cost over $ 100 per person , and would not have been nearly as good .
this place had such high reviews on yelp that we drove all the way from scottsdale on our vacation to tempe to visit this place .
i just do n't think the food quite justified the cost .
but they 're pretty quick for take our orders and very convenient for junction area locals .
they have a full bar with decent selection of beers on tap , by the bottle and wine .
it is simple , absolutely delicious , and filling .
the bar seats could be a tad bit more comfortable given that they have a huge wait so it doesnt hurt to make your bar chairs more comfy for those who would like to sit at the bar and eat .
considering the check total was already small , she could have tried to increase it .
good beer selection with the opportunity to order pitchers rather than just pints .
i read other reviews about service being bad and i thought since they were n't busy then there 's no way it can be slow but proved me wrong .
what made me mad was the incredibly small portion given for 13 $ which is ridiculous considering you could get food elsewhere that tastes better with larger portions and cheaper .
it 's totally faded .
the decor is kind of strange i do n't know why .
fantastic beer menu . the cocktails were unique mixing beer and alcohol .
mind you , these were two draft beers , one bottle , and a glass of wine and there was only one patron sitting at the bar .
the interior is nostalgic , sure , but really just cluttered and painful to look at .
the decor is boring , the one in nyc is exciting to go into with lots of design elements and crazy decor .
the server was very nice but my biggest complaint would be the manager who was sitting on her cell phone the entire time .
the seasoning was a little too salty but good .
my friends and i shared a bottle of wine which was reasonably priced .
it was super cheap .
$ 1.75 for an egg on top is ridiculous when it should be free !
been going here for 20 years great place to eat . watched george grow up through the years good kid
nice dining area , great patio and a cozy bar .
not many beers on tap , but what they had were pretty good .
and did i mention that the margarita was very weak ? i think the bartender forgot the tequila .
although i do n't drink beer , i was impressed by their incredible selection of beer on tap .
by bender i really mean a nice quiet stay on the strip , with my husband , to escape the minnesota cold .
furthermore , the guy charges 70 cents per topping which puts the normal toppings at 2.80 on top of the 8 dollars and change for the sandwich . 23 bucks for 2 of them .
tom and his staff are super friendly and they truly appreciate your business .
the entrees were beautiful , tasty and well prepared .
although i do n't drink beer , i was impressed by their incredible selection of beer on tap .
they have a large menu with a good variety .
price : fairly priced .
you clearly did not want us there and i 'm glad to take my service elsewhere .
it was a drab design with pretty pathetic food .
no draft beer - but they have a good bottle selection .
neither of my beers were apparently classified for happy hour .
the food is delicious and the atmosphere is nice and cozy .
the owner gave us a glass of sicilian wine which we loved and bought a bottle after .
awesome , trendy atmosphere .
decor : it 's so colourful ( not in a tacky `` ugly betty '' way ) i love it !
the crispy beef was unbelievably tasty .
sorry to say , i 'm done with this place , quality is poor and inconsistent , service is poor , some staff is rude . prices are ridiculous ... fries are awesome !
the rice was poorly shaped .
have tried the bbq chicken , butter chicken , chickpea with spinach as well as potato with spinach wraps . prefer with butter chicken and potato with spinach wraps .
nothing worse than getting a fried fish taco and it 's soggy .
we started with a house salad which was a nice portion . for entrees we ordered the popular crazy alfredo and rigatoni gorganzola with chicken .
it was sweet and refreshing and with just the right amount of alcohol to make waiting for my paella bearable ...
my fries were barely warm even though i asked for well done fries , and my burger was similarly barely warm ( would n't melt the cheese ) .
nice atmosphere , outside , since it is a taco truck .
appetizers were very good - chicken quesadilla and hot wings .
they have inside and outdoor seating , whatever you feel more comfortable with . there is a big beer variety , the server will be able to suggest something good for your taste .
i highly recommend this place .
pricey considering the portions but i 'm willing to pay .
ridiculously overpriced . dropped by before a show and ended up paying ~ $ 50 for two tiny appetizers and a drink .
i highly recommend the patagonia .
the bartender was very friendly and helpful .
come in on happy-hour that you can get oysters for $ 2 and colossal shrimps for $ 2.25 at the bar .
the main courses were disappointing as i could not wait to taste the homemade pasta which was tasteless and the accompanying marinara which in my opinion was bland .
everything is quick , tastes great .
i did not notice the message right away since we were off doing touristy things and so i get a follow up message reiterating the original offer .
they have a full bar with decent selection of beers on tap , by the bottle and wine .
i liked the chicken and the mussels .
we live near silverton and think it 's a great casino off the strip .
food was fresh , delicious and very much homestyle .
also enjoyed a bottle of wine hand selected by mo .
i had a chicken quesadilla and it was very dry . and my boyfriend 's food was very bland also .
the atmosphere is very casual with about a dozen tvs .
something to enjoy on the patio while the weather is still nice .
i highly recommend roman bistro for a romantic dinner , business lunch , or a family outing .
i enjoyed the food and it was very filling especially for the price i got from groupon $ 10 for $ 20 .
not sure who came up with the whacked cocktail menu but fortunately they have a good selection of craft beer on tap .
prices are very reasonable .
the noodles were good . the pork was too mushy .
good wine list , tasty cocktails .
the bathroom is n't necessarily dirty , but it is very rundown .
the lunch menu is extremely cheap .
when the server finally came over he looked confused and to be honest a little pretentious .
stick to the beer ... the bartender did n't know how to make an manhattan and produced an overly strong , undrinkable concoction .
nasty and weak margaritas that were being poured from a bucket . plain entrees .
you get huge portions for the cheap price - most dishes are under $ 10 !
i tried the $ 1.99 drink special - a caipirinha , very refreshing and large !
egg drop soup is n't that good but not bad .
the mac and cheese was great as well !
finally , the interior lighting is a bit odd .
shredded , frozen meat just does n't look that appetizing .
coupled with the complementary drink coupons i got for us guys , we pretty much drank for free all night .
the restaurant itself is beautiful - the ambiance is perfect for a nice night out .
this place was beautifully remodelled . love the patio , the food and service were great .
kind of gaudy ... stuck in the 1990 's .
magic oven offers delicious food at reasonable prices .
a very nice place . delicious salads and pizza .
bar staff is solid and nice . atmosphere is casual but energetic as the night goes on .
while we did not drink any booze , they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers , wine , and specialty cocktails .
you could breath wrong and she would still have an attitude . do n't know how she works in a customer service position when she acts like a complete asshole .
service was excellent and knowledgeable .
i would rather pay two dollars more and get better food . disappointed
i do n't drink but they had a huge selection of wine and beer .
to be honest , the entrance and bathrooms are actually kind of scary .
the lighting is kind of poor , but that adds to the charm .
good selection of beer and helpful bartender . unfortunately , they 'd just tapped out 2 of the 3 beers we chose .
our server was great and we were very pleased with everything .
the menu looked good , we thought the beer selection was good , especially having 12 draft beers .
good ambience , which is what you pay for .
the only beer they had was budweiser .
i learned you must get your own silverware and condiments , and i was n't sure if you were supposed to wait inside for your order , though a gal brought our food out to us .
just a heads up they do n't have liquor , only wine and beer .
wayy too many lights , went blind while eating .
it was clean , staff was very nice .
the ugly : the food .
service was attentive and efficient .
this place is n't fancy but the food is stellar and the prices are very reasonable .
i felt kind of dizzy a little bit to when i went to the bathroom because the room had these slanted walls at the sink too .
upon arriving , i was a little surprised that the restaurant is located in upstairs hallway of the casino .
i only had beer .
the bartender was attentive and friendly . i ordered their version of a margarita and it was quite tasty .
the prices are also very reasonable .
fair price for what you get for sure .
on other nights the service has been quick and even attentive at times .
we had some drinks at the bar - happy hour prices - and the drinks were very good .
service was unremarkable , ambience was like an extension of downtown lv : )
do n't tell the owner the beers are priced lower than pretty much every place that serves beer !
the prices are reasonable but not cheap .
the layout is almost uncomfortable and haphazard in a neat and orderly way somehow .
the draft and bottle beer selection is legit , but mostly focused on regional selections which was disappointing .
from the gray carpeting to the dull green walls , the cheap fixtures , the lack of art or music to the so-so food and slow service this place can best be described as dull , bland and boring mixed with no ambience at all .
service was good every time i went . friendly staff .
the staff were nice and fairly attentive .
definitely impressed once we stepped inside for early lunch .
there was no beer on draft , and the waitress was inexperienced .
only bad part of the experience was we stood at the `` wait to be seated '' sign for well over 5 minutes and had to walk into the bar area to flag someone down .
after being seated , we found that our napkins were damp . the waiter questioned our observation and grudgingly replaced them .
it 's in the ghetto and feels ghetto but it 's amazing ! so do n't let the looks put you off .
the total came up to just under $ 10 with the cheesecake being $ 6 .
i 'm just not sure why i should be tipping .
overall , the dish was very bland , and the chicken dry , and overcooked .
wonderful smooth hookah and i really enjoyed the mix of watermelon strawberry and a hint of lemon recommend by our server .
they have some silly paintings hanging up that are amusing .
on a plus side it was only $ 20 plus tax per person which is cheap for a nice hotel like this one .
the toilets in the men 's bathroom were filled to the top with urine and would not flush .
price is reasonable for the food .
good food at reasonable prices .
5 ) club level heavy base `` serenade '' by white snake , guns and roses and unknown others over the sound system was just plain annoying and weird for a nice supper .
ron is super friendly and nice .
great prices on food and 24 hours . a bit noisy inside but you ca n't beat the prices new york steak and eggs late night special is only $ 6.99 comes with bread and home fries .
our food was n't terrible but it was n't good enough to want to go back .
visiting from california and surprised to find this place .
the people watching is great .
what an amazing wine bar !
the building is beautiful inside , big windows , and a high tin ceiling .
good selection of drinks and beer on tap but i was dissapointed they did n't have a drink menu so we had no idea what anything cost .
the $ 3 charge to share food is pretty stupid .
kind of the industrial feel i guess .
it was poorly rolled because the pieces were falling apart and the rice was a little dry .
the atmosphere is pleasant too , with spacious seating and high ceilings to complement the fine dining .
although we did n't try a margarita , they do have a pretty good beer selection .
my one complaint was that the men 's bathroom was shockingly dirty and in serious need of repair .
my entire team loved it .
expensive for no reason .
good bar to drink at ... but maybe not eat at
not crazy about the decor though .
drinks came quickly ... the cucumber martini is unique and while it 's not my type of drink i tried it and liked it .
their patio is pretty awesome .
i did n't drink but the bottles and canned beer , as well as the wine , selection looked nice as well .
the only okay thing was the chicken satay we ordered for the children . the water was infused with fruit , that was n't bad .
i love the new mexico style of food and great selection of seafood as well .
great food at a reasonable price .
the lighting was a little bright but maybe that 's just me .
boy ... it was almost like a school cafeteria with no privacy , extremely bright lights , and weird layout .
the server was there and made sure my water cup stayed full , but seemed a bit disengaged and brought us our check with our food , which i found kind of odd .
first time at brooklyn cafe . food was good , service was very good , greeted by owner .
honestly i felt like i was paying for the interior decoration and building .
we only thought the prices were high but quality does cost .
the beef was bland but the chicken was so over salted and drowned in teriyaki sauce , i could n't eat more than 2 or 3 bites .
my only complaint was the lack of service .
we told the waitress that we only had 11 oysters .
to be fair , it was only $ 28 and i should not expect prime beef for that price .
makes me uncomfortable and i find it tacky .
food is amazing . good drink specials on margaritas .
the mojito 's are very popular !
- although they only had three beers on tap , at least they were good craft beer choices .
i 'm in love with their green chili fries because they are quite possibly one of the best things i 've ever eaten and they 're vegetarian and can easily be made vegan .
prices are very reasonable .
nice to have late hours , bc we usually crave it late at night .
the meat is always great quality and they are crunchy yet not over done .
1. lighting level is way to dark , very hard to read the menu .
what a lovely little cafe with a beautiful travel theme .
and expensive for what you get .
loved the ambience too .
great wine list , expertly made cocktails . a wealth of specials supplemented the already substantial menu .
it reminded me of the cirque du soleil shows , as intended . i love the view from where i was sitting .
my friend got the lemonade , which is self-serve . i got the kombucha on tap , which was good but not as carbonated as i like it .
decor is a little uncomfortable but not bad .
they did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it 's not all about crappy beer .
there is so much potential but if you ca n't deliver on service it does n't matter .
about $ 40 for tax and tip for brunch buffet ( without the all you can drink champagne ) is a pretty good deal for the quality food that was served !
always got great recommendations and enjoyed the beers we drank .
we really liked this place !
i go to school right up the street and i always find myself here at lunch to pick up a burrito .
unfortunately he was disappointed because the beer taps were frozen and they could n't pour and beers !
here , we are in bed by 9:30. definitely would recommend for some wonderfully prepare tapas and i plan to check out 1/2 wine night with oysters so i can enjoy a bottle of rioja wine .
loved everything about it ( except bathroom is bland comparably even tho drop gold trim ceiling is an attempt ) .
there was a green stain on one of the bathroom towels and everything was just dingy , stained and disgusting .
we had breakfast this morning at guy 's place right on the strip in vegas .
great food and super low prices .
looking at the lunch specials everything was reasonably priced .
we also had a salad to split ( they do n't have individual size salads , which would have been nice ) , and it was fantastic .
one of my new favorite places in old town !
nachos and no beer does not make me happy .
food is good . decor is nice .
the room was old and tiny which i could have dealt with too but the wallpaper in bathroom was filthy . the entire bathroom was dirty .
great food and decent prices , but small portions so it 's a little pricier .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
the atmosphere is nice in there .
reasonable prices and good food .
very light but filling .
this place is disgusting , the food was shitty and as a xi'an person myself , i would say it 's the most disgusting lamb soap i have ever seen in my life !
the only reason for 4 stars is the hotel itself is pretty dated - outlets in our room did not work and we had problems with flickering lights .
the place is not visually appealing either , the vintage cluttered look only brought out the large amount of dust scattered on the decorations .
very friendly and helpful staff . food was very fresh and flavorful .
2. dinners were ok. not great not bad .
the food is n't too cheap , but the quality is very high .
sorry they do not take reservations as wait can be long .
every meal i have tried has been delicious . the meals are simple and tasty , and even healthy !
there is not one but two bars that serve 32 beer and ale on tap , 33 bottled beer , and an impressive selection of wine and liquor .
tequila selection was pretty good but the bartenders were clearly hired for other credentials than tequila knowledge , if you catch my drift .
the margaritas and drinks are all very bland and watered down despite what they advertise as `` 1800 '' tequila .
the crust is nice and crunchy !
the floors were also dirty in the everywhere . the bathroom was disgusting too .
i pretty much stick to my beer basics so i ordered a corona bottle .
it was nice to see something open in the empty restaurant space .
most of us came for drinks . we ordered 3 litres of their blonde , it was massive ... . others ordered their own drinks .
he made me off the menu cocktails with sorrel and grapefruit juice and we got the jerk chicken share plate which was so delicious .
there are so many great restaurants in phoenix , we heard this was good .
not to mention the very reasonable prices .
the prices very reasonable .
it was happy hour , which was a surprise , and the house made margaritas and red sangria `` the best '' were only $ 4 for a huge glass .
plus you will feel cool sitting there .
but you need much more than that to justify the very high prices .
we used to love this place and heard she was possibly gone or management had changed completely ? we 'd love to give it another shot if so !
love the drinks and servers .
the stout also has a great side patio for summer use , which is completely private and great for a relaxing afternoon of beverages with friends .
everything was so bland . overpriced .
the bad news : the lighting was horrible , so bright you did n't even notice there were candles on the table .
very clean and pretty good price .
this location is the only one on this side of town to get it right , each and every time .
the margarita was weak but ok and there is no way to screw up a cold corona !
the fried spring rolls were pretty standard , but had a somewhat unpleasant fryer oil flavour .
we asked if they can change to ground chicken and the server said `` no '' .
firstly , it 's so great to have a `` hip '' restaurant in the area - gives you the queen st vibe without having to drive there .
i 'm shamefully guilty of not yelping veneto sooner , for i 've been frequently over the years and they are always consistently excellent .
huge selection of tequila 's & whiskey will make this a uber night for sure in the future .
i told my friends they purposely did this to fill us up lol .
we enjoyed our dinner experience here and would definitely recommend .
the servers and staff at this place are great .
food is great , reasonable priced , and good portions .
quality is fine but i 'm not ever again paying $ 14 for a salad and a water . effen ridiculously overpriced .
the one thing i noticed is that the decor is either intentionally older or very outdated .
the beer glasses are n't cold .
however the beer was cold , and they had smithwick 's on tap .
super hh with reasonable prices for good food .
the prices . as good as the food was , it did not justify the prices .
we had some drinks which were delicious and not light on the pour .
i was astounded at how poorly these so called sushi rolls were .
i had the blackberry bourbon drink and it was delicious , much like a mint julep .
the ice cream tasted funky and made me really sick . i had the worst stomach ache after .
very very very bad service - they have 6-7 hostesses & the manager was not aware of the conflict of seating the 11 of us .
so that was kind of disappointing .
great food and drinks are strong .
so she ordered the butternut squash risotto and everything was muddled together on the plate like a blob and was extremely salty . my food was extremely salty as well .
definitely lots of love in that food . the buttermilk biscuits are incredible .
gave 4 stars because the decor was too boring and lighting was too bright .
give them a try , super nice spot
crust is thin and with the bread so delicious probably would have been tastier with a thicker crust .
the tile and fixtures were falling off the wall in the bathroom . the bed was rock hard .
pretty disappointing . dry fish tacos - also pricey , no side .
the food was worse than my own cooking and i barely finished anything .
most of it was spoiled by our waitress , who was too bossy at the table with my wife and acted impatient .
the chicken was okay but nothing to pay $ 20 for .
perfect combination and right amount of heat .
i had two beers and the beer was cold .
food is reasonably priced as well .
the first drink they brought me was in a tall beer glass and was disgusting because it was premade syrupy , sugary margarita mix .
prices are high too .
the garlic knots are sooooooooo good . the pizza has great taste and i love the thin crust .
we did not order any food , but this place gets 4 stars for it 's courteous bartender ( prompt , friendly service ) , delicious wine ( i had a lovely oregon pinot noir and my sister sipped a refreshing pinot grigio ) , and cool vibe .
slow and confused service . the server said that they were n't given trays to carry drinks .
service is very good and attentive .
but for $ 10 , i expect a pretty good sandwich .
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
price is good and food is good
mouth watering chicken - so salty and spicy .
i can also recommend their house margarita for a hot summer night .
very kind an courteous staff .
it can be a bit loud a times .
neither of these disappointed .
love this place ! been looking for a new spot to eat healthy at and i found it .
the lights kept getting dimmer and dimmer so all of a sudden i was deaf and blind : p food is so-so .
the only thing i did n't like it the garlic tuna sushi .
the men 's bathroom was not clean and the hand towel was jammed .
bar prices are also super cheap .
all together it was about $ 60 which of course is expensive for two items and juice , but also it 's the wynn in vegas .
the food was very good , and a bit spicy !
my poco pollo was a little on the dry side but the flavor was okay . my lunch companions beef taco salad was large and he said the taste was fine , however , the dressing was not good .
it 's the kind of experience that i 'm sure i 'll crave again in the future .
food is ok , i would not pay full price and it seems horribly over priced .
nice staff too ! this is definitely our go to sushi place near home .
we have sat on both the bar and restaurant side , but enjoy the scene at the bar side much better . the patio is also very nice , but with the no reservation policy , it 's difficult to get a seat on a nice day .
; ) every app and entree was on the mark , and they were also serving up blueberry long island iced teas that night ... magnifique !
i had the salmon and a mule drink . the drink was nice and refreshing .
the nachos are balanced and hearty , the crab enchiladas were great , and have the best fish taco i 've ever tasted .
tuesday specials of a free bottle of house wine with two entrees is a reason to go on tuesday .
the prices are extremely reasonable .
she then said her and her manager did n't know it came as `` original '' despite it you know , being on the menu .
perfect weather means spending time outside , and that always means a trip to noda .
i stopped in for a pre-dinner drink and enjoyed the house riesling . my fiance had a red blend and a cab , one of which was on special for happy hour .
family friendly and great staff ! definitely recommend this place to anyone in the tempe area
the patio was cool and comfortable ; a good place to people watch .
great place for a first date .
always spotless service and facility and amazing food .
they have really great lunch specials . you get a lot of food for a low price .
simply fantastic . we got a special deal , a room overlooking the strip .
the drinks are also splendid !
the dipping sauce was just as disappointing if not more .
that said , it 's a nice space .
good prices and clean enough .
great food , good ambiance , great wine and amazing steaks and fries , and if you were seated on the patio ( right on the lvb strip ) you are bound to have an amazing time watching people walk by and catch a glimpse of the bellagio dancing fountains .
no alcohol this trip , but they do have a full bar , with 5 beers in tap .
nothing special that warranted $ 6 a taco that 's for sure .
the prices were pretty outrageous .
i was underwhelmed with the decor and dirty windows besides all of that lets talk about the food .
the food is n't cheap , but it 's good !
i have always had good luck with these guys .
the portions are so huge , especially the pancakes and ham . i have always had good service and food .
so excited that this opened up near my office . we go at least once a week .
plus , the bathrooms ( located upstairs ) are marvelous .
a little fat is one thing , but an entire appetizer of burnt ends and all of it was fat ?
the glass was literally a 4 ounce after ice was filled to the top and you expect me to pay $ 4.50 for another soda ?
the only good part is the beautiful building .
this is a cute little creperie on ste .
a small piece of chicken is 30 dollars , a steak very small is 48 dollars .
good food , great atmosphere , nice staff . i particularly love their aged tofu , dragon roll and seaweed salad .
they had curtains between two rooms with random stuff everywhere . it was scary i felt like i was in a haunted house .
pretty good wine selection i guess , i 'm not a wine guy . not much of a beer selection for being a beer and wine bar .
their happy hour menu is excellent and their food is fresh and savory .
maria was a great server .
a nice respite from the more hectic and noisy restaurants that you can find plenty of in the restaurant district .
that 's the least they could do for a $ 300 tab for mediocre food .
it was very loud . the stained glass and pews were interesting , but the other random pictures on the walls did n't make sense .
pretty good food for a good price .
service was really good and the food is really good for a reasonable price . $ 13 for a gyros dinner plate is a very good deal considering you get a good portion .
there is not one but two bars that serve 32 beer and ale on tap , 33 bottled beer , and an impressive selection of wine and liquor .
it 's not cheap .
seated quickly , food came out fast and service was great !
he said it was bland and the shrimp were hard ( over cooked ) .
upon advising our server of this ( the one who did n't even check to see if the cup she was serving coffee in to her client was clean ) she did n't even apologize or seem surprised !
the happy hour mojito was also really well made .
that 's embarrassing and bad business .
they had some loud live music , maybe it is my age speaking but why must live music be so loud ?
always a treat ! they 're known for pizza , which is fantastic , but the pasta and sandwiches are amazing too .
some sections were more family-oriented while other areas would be nice to sit with a date .
so basically i 'm putting one star because we waited a hole hour for no sushi 2 tables were done and we still had nothing we literally had to walk out . it was also 3 birthdays in our party but only 4 people all you can eat sushi .
they , were not especially busy , but we noticed most of the people around us were waiting significant amounts of time as well for service and food .
the prices are ridiculously cheap .
the decor was atrocious ( i would rather not have to look at a statue of a naked man while i am eating ) and the walls were covered in pictures of half-naked people and pin-up girls .
great pizza and great service ! loved the tasty red sauce , crispy crust and friendly atmosphere .
our waitress jennifer from oc cali was so helpful and had great suggestions .
walking in , i felt a little intimidated by the overwhelming presence of stuff on the walls and trophies everywhere .
prices are very , very reasonable ( especially for a touristy town like vegas ) .
fried rice was dry and no flavor .
the decor is very eclectic and atmosphere is perfect .
the eggs were soggy , the potatoes were mushy , and the ham steak was disgusting .
it 's still creepy .
the interior is spacious and lively . great place for a night out with friends .
the `` thing '' on the ceiling ... well , i 'm not sure of its purpose .
the service was slow and awkward .
the total for all of it was $ 29 because of their happy hour prices .
after she finally brings the drinks we do n't see her again until the end of the meal .
great drink list with specialty beers and wine available .
i 've been recommended by other charlotteans to check this place out and decided it would be a great opportunity to go for dinner with some out-of-town guests .
typical pricey steakhouse but did n't wow me . steak and food were mediocre there are better places in the city when your spending that kind of $ .
however , the tea costed $ 5 and the quality was so poor .
clean , attractive , inviting . nice !
firstly : the restaurant name does n't give enough credit to the classy interior .
it was delicious and very reasonably priced at $ 7 .
the beef pie and pork dumplings are terrific and the squash dumplings have a unique flavor .
orders the fried shrimp ... ..when i got it ... .i honestly could have gone to mcdonald 's .
the inside looks very clean and modern .
the restaurant has a nice ambiance , but it 's definitely the come as you are vibe .
it was scream across the table and barely be understood kind of loud . it was `` i wish they 'd turn it from from building shaking to just ear splitting '' kind of loud . it was just give up and write notes on a napkin kind of loud .
they had several beers on tap but not that amazing of a selection of bottled microbrews ( but enough that most people would be happy ) .
they have amazing pizza sushi !
i spy a coffee bean on the ceiling ... so cool .
also the place is clean and service is friendly !
food is great and priced very fair .
also in the morning at 5 am there was a loud alarm that awoke us for idk what reason it went on for about two minutes and i was irritated because i have a hard time sleeping again after awoken . i managed to sleep shortly after but the alarm went off stating the problem was resolved repeating the phrase three times before going off !
signage indicates brunch - i imagine this is amazing , as they have a quaint patio .
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
oh , did i mention the lights were bright ?
service was great ! women 's bathroom was a little too dark , especially in the sink area !
price is very reasonable .
heard good things about this buffet . but sadly it was not worth the $ 45 ... not too many options , the food was bland , it was n't the wow !
i highly recommend it .
only reason i give this a 4 star is because of price . prices are high but i guess that 's expected for a restaurant on the strip .
i rarely would try more than 2 anyways , but it just feels unfriendly .
only bummer for me was their bathroom lights = ( i know that may be the style they 're going for but i do n't like it when its dark in there . spooky .
the hollandaise sauce was good , but not good enough to save the dish .
the wine list is thorough without being overwhelming and is well priced .
i can say the space itself was comfortable and decorated nicely .
drinks were good and strong , and service was the best !
they looked confused and looked around for the order ticket and then came up and apologized for forgetting .
they had a pretty decent beer selection from what i recall . additionally they offered wine selections .
other than that , this place is grimy , creepy , and nasty .
terrible place ! they need to find manners big time .
the portions are seriously outrageous and the prices are decent .
chicken on sticks , little spice is my absolute favourite thing on their menu . i 'm addicted .
price is very reasonable .
it felt like someone accidentally spilled a salt shaker on the chicken , covered it with something green ( watercress ? )
so in this city i ca n't compare locations because i am from los angeles but i do know great food when i taste it and this place put its mark on my list of go try .
the beer selection was decent for canned beers but the only had one brand on tap and the one i wanted was out .
the meat is very dry , tough , and tasteless .
struggled to find a piece of katsu with chicken larger than a few pieces of paper thick .
nice private room , good food and service . they also have a patio with great views and great spot for photos with the strip all lit up in the back ground
we tried two of the mocktails : a blood orange one and the pomegranate tea , both of which were super good and not too sweet .
i asked her if there was a problem and another customer came up to me and told me she has a nasty attitude and gave her problems as well !
for dinner i ordered the 3 piece chicken meal . total cost , $ 7 .
i also love how plants are waved up on the stone wall .
i recommend their flatbreads , burgers , and for an appetizer i would go with bruchetta ... so good !
mild was a good spicy , medium was tolerable hot spicy , and hot was killer .
very bland food , basically a take out place . they have beers listed on the menu board but they were out of drafts , out of modelo , and the corona was n't cold !
nothing was overly mushy or caked in sauce , which was a good thing !
i love the service here now , the staff is excellent respectful and very professional .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
a little ghetto , but smart .
i also tried the clam chowder but it was rather bland and a bit watery to my liking .
awesome . glad to have more ethnic food in the northwest and this place holds it ground against the chinatown ramen houses
the time i got chicken carbonara , it tasted like someone poured hot 2 % milk over noodles- runny and flavorless .
everything on the menu is priced cheap .
i would highly recommend the chicken spring sandwich too .
great prices , okay service , diner food ... food was below average but what can you expect from a $ 10 prime rib joint ?
we were told though that it was first come , first served , in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the bellagio and the strip .
2 stars because my server was so nice . i would have paid for the meal but she took it off the bill .
and their home made green peach tea was delicious , we went through about four glasses each .
i expected it to be overly sweet but this was n't the case at all .
the decor is hipsterish in an unkempt way and bathrooms were atrocious ... .
the meat is always moist and delicious and you get tons of it whether you order the gyro sandwich , salad or plate .
the meat is tender and the tomatoes give a slightly sweet tang to the dish .
it was okay the interior decorations was very amusing .
they were kind enough to cut up the meat and noodles for me as i was taking pho to my sick father .
they have a great two for one deal for brunch at $ 19.99 .
sadly i did n't get a beer .
the bacon was really thickly sliced and absolutely amazing !
there was only 2 other people up there and the bartender acknowledge us right away and said he would be right with us .
great fresh kabobs and appetizers just really really good food .
waitress got him something else and seemed like she did n't mind and cared that he was n't happy .
keep up the good work guys ! you are definitely a favorite in my book !
my girlfriend got a drink that she was super excited about but they told her they did n't have any .
my favorite thing about this place is really their adequate amount of outdoor seating , making it a good location for a weekend brunch .
loved this place . great food , great service , though kinda odd and small interior .
i was pissed and if i would have said something to the staff , it would have come out all wrong .
tuna salad was great . kids enjoyed their pizza .
curry chicken was bland . it was pretty big .
prices are decent too .
unfortunately , when we were seated the hostess told us that they had run out of the bass that was on the set menu for az restaurant week .
i witnessed the manager and wait staff scrambling around the restaurant in a sad attempt to keep up .
all that and a good wine list , beer selection , interesting cocktails and cool ambiance .
the wine was fantastic , they had a wide variety of wine selections .
they have a full bar with beers on tap with no drink or beer menu ?
i liked the presentation and unique bowl shape . my dish was cooked thoroughly , the veggies fresh , and there was a good balance of everything in it .
great , lunch or dinner . comfortable room with minimal decor or distractions .
nice , dim lighting . decor a little heavy on the taxidermy , but the decorator kept to her concept and constructed a coherent atmosphere .
another bummer was that they only service wine and beer , but lacked a strong list of either .
we had the spring rolls , and they were wonderful .
love sitting on the patio when the weather is nice .
i have to say looking around and the waitress being as unfriendly as possible are hope 's were declining by the minute .
tasty but only six a plate for $ 15 .
the cocktails and wine were delicious . service was friendly and on point .
we complained waitress just said sorry then continued on her way she did n't offer to heat it up or replace it .
prices are very reasonable .
the price is so cheap !
also , you get a $ 5 discount per person if you are from california which was a nice surprise !
it 's a busy place and small so it 's a very loud .
making it worse we sat right in front of her the whole time .
highly recommended . great to pair with one of their delicious paloma drinks !
every time i have gone , i have experienced wonderful service from every server i have had . love this place and i can not recommend it enough
service was good , no complaints there .
mirrors on all the walls which i hate when i am eating , but other than that it was very nice .
the lighting leading up is pretty poor as well .
the worst part was the meat , instead of thin deli meat i was given a single thick slab of burnt dry turkey dinner meat and 3 tiny burnt pieces of bacon no longer than my little finger .
i pay $ 7 in nyc for happy hour .
it had just right amount of spices , pumpkin , and sweetness .
the girls at the host desk were pretty awful .
staff was very attentive and professional .
you wo n't be disappointed !
i do feel a bit sorry for the owner tonight though since it was only her in the restaurant taking care of customers .
she never asked if we needed anything or to see if everything was good or not .
on top of that , when the waitress brought our food out she stopped before she got to our table and talked to the bartender for minutes so loudly and animated .
it is definitely the perfect date spot if your wanting to impress someone or on a special evening !
the waffles were cooked perfectly and the chicken was fresh and moist . i was a fan of the dill mayo - very flavourful .
we ordered the octopus , which was incredibly tender , the deep fried artichokes , which were very very crispy and delicious , the beef heart , which i just loved and the pork tenderloin , which was a bit too salty .
you do n't need to be able to see every inch of it , but it 's a little weird to have creepy bathroom mood lighting .
dark , poor lighting and big tables that are uncomfortably .
as customer i do . or want to hear about employee problems look at camera around 9:15 or so you can see you super positive employee talking to cocktail cocktail waitress he basically said company sucked and was doing stupid stuff .
the decor is a little out dated but i love this place .
or perhaps reducing the price since the crab is what makes it expensive .
spring rolls are a staple and the chopped pork with rice ( c1 i beleive ) is really good .
i was told they have a good selection of beers on tap .
it was a warmer day and a corona sounded good , however , they had a decent craft beer selection and full bar .
but the service at this location really horrible .
the bartenders were friendly and they had a decent selection of wines by the glass . i ended up with a glass of rose and enjoyed it .
i think the *only* `` complaint '' i have ( very very minor because the food was so incredibly awesome ) was that there was a bright florescent light in the kitchen that shone out into the dining room quite brightly -- they might want to shade the dining room a bit better at night to create a cozier atmosphere .
to start , the prices are a little too high to be paying for lunch .
we went her because we had a gift certificate and thought let 's go , well everything was awful , the service sucked the waiter was rude and the food was awful .
$ 42 for 2 sodas and a weak beer and we went somewhere else for dinner .
the most we have waited was only about 20 minutes , so no worse than any other place on a weekend .
tasty , unique cocktails and an extensive wine list with something at every price point .
even though i was not drinking this time , i could not help but notice the excellent selection of draft beers .
the hostess asked us to wait while she finished her conversation then we asked for a held booth to which she responded , `` i do n't have any booths at this time '' . she seats us and the half booth tables there is 6 total , one group of 3 sitting at one ya me , 3 dirty and one clean .
the food was cold and does not taste fresh .
they are always very nice and accommodating .
i normally would order a seafood noodle dish , however they did not have them here .
not very clean and it smelled like something had burned .
amazing atmosphere . amazing taste and ingredients .
i did not enjoy the entire dish .
the only negative is that i wish they had a larger selection of beer on tap . they had 7 beers on tap but they did have a huge selection of bottle beers .
the osso buco was by far the disappointment of the evening ; it was tough and dry and underseasoned , the poor execution trifecta .
maybe it is the odor of fresh carpet ( weird because it is n't carpeted ) but it is super dark in there .
seriously , i expect better for that price .
surprised that there were a few true craft beers ( in bottles , no taps ) .
they have a great drink selection and beers on tap . and their cocktails are delicious .
you wo n't be disappointed !
fair priced and tastes good .
lighting in the rooms were terrible - ladies , good luck applying makeup - men , best of luck shaving !
but for 50 dollar chicken it should be better than good .
they have a fabulous burger and great martinis . try the happy hour .
the prices for all the food is very reasonable too .
this place is great ! friendly staff & great food !
i called to ask what could be done and was told `` sorry '' and hung up . will never order from them again .
where just one drink can easily cost you $ 5 or more .
looks pretty nice inside and the staff and service was great
first of all , they only have beer and wine , no liquor .
a little expensive , but you get what you pay for .
certainly not as fantastic as people have told me .
place is nice and price is reasonable .
the price is great as well .
good food at a reasonable price .
they also have some patio seating and that was really enjoyable .
they have a nice selection of bourbon and whiskey cocktails as well as beer and wine . their salads look incredible as does their signature chicken and waffles dish .
the food is delicious and reasonably priced .
super nice people . hip place .
great kitschy , cool decor , friendly , hip service and delicious food .
i will never eat there again . this place is horrible !
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
the price per person is about $ 10 , which is a great deal being on the strip !
all in all , a wonderful meal - very rich & very tasty .
but when i told the waitress this usual order , she repeated my order with a slow incredulous blink and unnecessary tone , `` all the toppings ? ''
prices are reasonable and quality was very good .
i could not finish my enchiladas . they both were so bland tasting we were very disappointed .
i would be remiss not to mention the blueberry infused vodka martini -- where do they get such a great selection of fine alcohol .
18 oz domestics in a cold schooner for $ 3 all day , ca n't beat that unless your gambling .
the food was pretty expensive too ( $ 22 for tartare and $ 29 for steak ) .
the food is very good , pricing is very reasonable .
this place left me feeling confused . it 's so beautiful and shiny , but so beautiful and shiny that it made me feel dirty and cheap .
i got the bill and it was $ 22 so not cheap ... the market sandwich with no meat on it was $ 12 !
price not so bad .
my happy dining experience cost under $ 7.00 , well worth it .
great food great prices . amazing noodles ...
the pricing was quite reasonable .
the one thing i missed in the beer list was an indication of how many ounces they pour for the different beers .
great cocktails , but no draft beer . need i say more ?
the pizza was really delicious with the sausage blending in with the other ingredients to make a great taste .
the staff was super friendly , we had a friendly conversation with both of the employees the whole time .
drinks were fantastic : strong but sweet .
the prices are decent .
we had to ask for our waters as they only brought out enough for half of the table .
really was pleasantly surprised by this place .
the ambiance is cozy , modern , open , and warmly lit . i loved the couch booths .
i tasted the fries which are made from scratch with were great .
the food is priced reasonably and the servers are nice too .
drinks are decently priced and the food is well ... bar food .
it 's only 50 cents and well worth it .
the only good part i saw was the selection of beer on tap .
after a very depressing trip up to az from ca to watch my packers have arguably the worst game of their lives , my friends and i stopped here to eat before heading back to los angeles ( 6 hr drive ) .
we had a wonderful dinner last week !
when my food was finally ready a different employee took my money but was talking to a man that looked homeless the entire time .
we only had appetizers but entrees look good.. not a lot of beers on tap but the ones they had were craft beers and were decent choices .
draft beer was not as cold as it should be , order bottles . crappy music .
sure price ? $ 12 include drink food quality ?
like , to the point of almost crossing the creepy line , but then we saw the wait staff were hovering over everyone and not just us , so that made it better .
negatives - the only negative i can think of is the lighting is a bit dull and dated .
the restaurant has a bar-type ambience but it 's not too loud , just right .
the decor is interesting and i like the paintings , too bad they are n't really painted . but still a good choice of art to hang up : ) the waitresses here are wearing weird uniforms like little maids .
seriously avoid this restaurant .
the food was delicious . it 's reasonably priced too .
the chicken fried rice was made with a meat that was not the texture or flavor that chicken should be , and the dumplings were flavorless .
excellent food and vibe . if you want a lively experience , check this place out during dinner time when live bands are playing .
to be honest , the entrance and bathrooms are actually kind of scary .
my world tour ( mixed drink ) was delicious !
this is definitely a go to place after a late night of drinking !
but for $ 14.50 i was disappointed .
let me start by saying the customer service is horrible .
the non-japanese food is mediocre and not worth the price .
i also gave their peach pear smoothie a try and definitely recommend it for a nice , light refreshing treat .
good work all around !
just beware of the bathroom , it 's a little bit creepy .
decor is weird since the ceiling looks like it should belong in an italian joint ( fake vineyard look complete with grapes ) .
the bar staff were wonderful in suggesting complementary drinks with your specific choice of coronary experience .
kind but like all salesmen trying to get you to order tequila , drinks , ( at 11 am ) beer , margaritas , dessert ? anything ?
i will still order the soba noodle salad but i wo n't try anything else from bad experiences .
i got the pasta with clams and my husband got the tri-tip , everything was delicious !
the booth seats are not as comfortable as they looked , but fine .
the prices are very reasonable - i like that .
cabbage ( 4.0/5.0 ) - perfect balance of soy and spices .
only disappointment was i did n't get the 1/2 chicken .
we were really happy with the food served and the service was excellent ! will definitely come back again when i 'm in the area
there 's no hard liquor , just beer and wine .
i had alaskan halibut which was cooked to perfection , and a gin and tonic that had a wonderfully healthy serving of gin . a great way to start a night .
each savory bite is juicy , tender , and with so many sandwich choices , you ca n't go wrong cause they 're all good .
this was good , but the lobster was a little underwhelming as it was lacking in flavor .
the flavor of the cheese wiz ( even though there was very little ) dominated the sandwich and ruined it . the beef itself was flavorless .
this place was just weird and creepy .
parking is kind of weird and the decor is minimal ... but who cares .
quick , cheap , filling .
it 's just a artificial crime scene , a few framed descriptions and computers .
i 'm willing to pay $ 20- $ 30 for my plate of food but it at least has to be decent and good service should be the easiest thing for restaurants to figure out .
as for the wine pairing , the wine was perfectly explained and the sommelier presented insights about each region as well as the reason behind the choice selection .
surprised that there were a few true craft beers ( in bottles , no taps ) .
prices are good for a ton of food and the beer list is decent .
my family and i have come here many times and it 's always been a good time .
the ingredients are n't bad . prices are decent .
i enjoyed my visits at houlihan 's . meals are very tasty and staff members are nice .
in the summer you can enjoy the patio and in the winter it 's a cozy place to watch the world go by .
the price is pretty competitive so that 's always a plus .
plus , the dish we got was cold .
from the gray carpeting to the dull green walls , the cheap fixtures , the lack of art or music to the so-so food and slow service this place can best be described as dull , bland and boring mixed with no ambience at all .
we just finished lunch here , had a very interesting appetizers ... scallops and the prawns .
in addition the music was so loud that the musicians could not hear themselves .
i have tried all the food on the menu and all of it tastes great .
the price , cheap !
prices here are really good and have some pretty good promos for ex .
when you walk in there 's all these flowers and it 's so bright and colorful , the uniforms are lame tho , they could do something about that pink housekeeper look .
our server was great . she was quick and very attentive .
the drinks were good .
- although they only had three beers on tap , at least they were good craft beer choices .
if your looking for good italian and do n't want to spend outrageous strip prices , i recommend mezzo 's
bib salad was outstanding if you love fresh lettuce try it .
the wait staff is very attentive .
price was reasonable too .
when drunk , finding the bathroom at remedy 's is like a mini maze .
the wines are all from ontario and we were both surprised to find one we liked during the $ 8 a glass after 8pm happy hour .
they have these spinach tikki fritter appetizer things with cream cheese in them that were both unexpected and freaking awesome .
they may be better off doing fewer things right .
i got the orange bourbon blast ( name is not right but you get the idea ) and he got a pimms cup , i believe .
after waiting for 50 minutes for our food we finally asked about it and got the run around .
it is pretty good . the price is really reasonable .
you wo n't be disappointed .
the prices are very reasonable .
while some claim that the ribs were overcooked , i never had anything on my plate that was less than perfect .
the menu looked good , we thought the beer selection was good , especially having 12 draft beers .
albondigas - delicious , scallops - perfectly cooked and accompanied by a cilantro pesto , and gorgonzola chips , good but i did n't love .
sauce was good but there needed to be more cheese .
it was an extraordinary value for $ 130 per person .
filthy ! there is no reason a `` hole in the wall '' restaurant needs to be dirty ... the floors , the tables , the walls , the stained ceiling !
plenty of food for a reasonable price !
the price is reasonable .
the rice though ... . i dunno why the rice was so mushy and i hated it but the fish quality was really good .
everything about this place is amazing . it 's such a cozy and intimate environment that makes you feel nowhere close to fremont street .
i get the fact of the hipster décor and approach to almost anything that involves food nowadays , but old christmas decorations lining the walls it just ridiculous .
our server was great and i had a glass of the moscato d'asti and it was delicious .
we asked for something different and we were rudely forced to wait . once we were finally seated , we were ignored by the wait staff for 15 minutes before someone stopped to ask if we wanted a beverage , but we had no beverage menu .
nothing cozy or intimate about this space , harsh light and monochromatic ( gray ) color scheme .
you get what you pay for and although the pricing is high for where we come from , it 's inline with vegas strip costs .
service is courteous and relaxed .
five stars for food . the sole reason for one star is the unappealing glaring cold fluorescent lighting in this place .
i got the peach iced tea with lychee jellies and it was pretty good but i thought it was overpriced .
the restaurant has an intimate setting , so it may be hard to spot your waiter at times .
additionally , they only had two glasses of champagne for purchase , cheapest was $ 24 . then all the rest was in bottles and the cheapest was $ 60 .
good selection of beer and helpful bartender . unfortunately , they 'd just tapped out 2 of the 3 beers we chose .
we did have a reservation at 630 and did n't get seated till 7 they gave our reservation away but then we talked to a manager who was super nice and she said 2 appetizers on the house and her daughter would be our waitress .
i would deff recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal ! it 's good for family or friends
i would n't even be willing to give this place another shot .
lazy sunday night in and decided to try a new pizza place and we all decided to give fatso 's a try .
i ordered a chicken tostada which was ok , not full of flavor and side salad was dry .
the soup - you must get the soup . homemade - and delicious .
the decor is very pretty and they have a beautiful outdoor eating area for nicer weather . the staff there is wonderful .
small menu , location and atmosphere was nice .
not only do they skimp on chicken , the chicken tasted dry and reheated .
prices are good and atmosphere is also good .
unfortunately , they lack beer on tap but the do have a variety of bottles .
good service and good prices .
we did have great wait staff and the drink specials are excellent .
they make a great arnold palmer though ...
at noodles the prices are outrageous , but the food is delicious .
the selection is great but could have used some higher quality items given the price tag .
we rarely can eat here for under $ 30 for two of us , with gluten free adding $ 1- $ 2 per item .
the view was great . it was november so the prices were cheap and the pool was closed .
loved everything we ordered including dessert !
price is reasonable though .
one server walked by my empty plate 5 times before my hubby finally spoke up and asked for the check .
prices are ok , but go on tuesdays if you want the special .
it was cold and tasted horrible .
my friend and i both got sparkling lemonades and they were amazing .
the wait staff was attentive , knowledgeable and pleasant .
random but the bathroom was clean .
me and my work friends pop in here on our lunch break because it 's fast and the food is good .
i will say , $ 32.00 for a double shot of a medium quality blended scotch ( that 's the cost of a full bottle ) was pretty ridiculous .
dark , dingy and dirty were the words that came to mind .
the food is always fresh and extremely tasty . the food is delicious , although overpriced .
the ambience was just outright creepy .
sorry , but i was not spending close to $ 75 on mediocre food .
the waitress started out great explaining everything to us but i could n't tell you who she was since 2 people ran our food and another topped our water .
great value , delicious flavours . classic enough that you are comforted by familiar flavours but different with a unique twist .
1st time here , the service is great & the restaurant is so beautiful ! definitely recommend it .
reasonable prices for great food .
it 's kind of dark and depressing .
lighting is very dim ( meant for ambience but makes it hard to read the menu ) .
one party of 3 and one party of 2. was surprised at how long it took to seat us .
great service . delicious food and drink .
tasty beers ! huge space indoors which was fresh and hip .
the floors were like fly paper when you walked in . your feet practically stuck to the floors .
only complaint is we wished they had beers on tap , though they had a decent bottle selection .
it 's kind of an elegant comfort food with asian sushi kind of flair , i would guess , in a beautiful modern setting .
they had a bunch of great beers on tap as well as korean drinks and delicious cocktails .
drinks are a good size and prices are very reasonable .
( what is wrong with sound absorbing ceilings , so seldom seen in toronto ? )
the staff was nice and helpful .
seems weird to have a bartender that did n't know how to make the margaritas on the menu .
do n't understand this kind of business attitude .
the service is good , the place is clean and the food is ok. got $ $ to blow ?
well , neither ... we just wanted to make sure our ticket had n't gotten lost .
i 'm definitely happy they came to canada .
it was gothic , creepy , but strangely noisy .
although it was flavorful , the dish was lukewarm which had me question whether it would 've tasted better hot or cold .
the prices are very reasonable - dinner for two ( 4 tacos and 2 bottles of water ) was just under $ 30 including tip .
least expensive option is going to run ~ $ 9 . scale up from there if any extras or different proteins .
the workers were friendly and it is open super late with delivery .
the halibut and accompanying corn salsa was delicious .
the interior of the restaurant is perfect on a scorcher of a phoenix afternoon .
they were personable , funny , accommodating and very genuine . we will definitely be back .
even if you have to charge more , it will be less apparent if you offer 6. a bit weak , especially for vegas , to me .
price is also reasonable .
the bbq is great - we all agreed their cornbread is excellent and everyone loved their bacon fried brussels sprouts !
pricing was totally affordable .
they were tasteless and hard .
would recommend for a quick meal with pleasant staff .
the calamari is overcooked , very dry .
my favorite was the pepperoni with pesto and any that had a blackened crust .
i 'm sorry but i 'm already paying a premium here and $ 10 for a potato is insane .
i can say this is the best broasted ( fried ) chicken i have had in years .
it was good but the chicken was better .
pros : delicious , great value for your money ( especially for it 's location on the strip ) cons : can get busy during our trip to vegas a couple weeks ago , my sister-in-law , a las vegas local , recommended we try this place for their delicious waffles .
though parking van be challenging , it 's a nice warehouse converted to a brewery with some of the tastiest fermented beverages on tap .
great chill atmosphere . excellent wine selection & offerings whether by the glass , flights or bottles .
we had the brat sandwich on great fresh bread .
they were only good for light beer even thought they said any domestic beer .
the iced tea was bad !
good sandwiches , salads , soups and of course the cookies . great service for quick lunch .
the food was so good and bottle of wines were affordable .
every thought has been put into place to make this a great dining experience : beautiful dishes , fine furniture , well decorated and seating for close to 150 people .
here is what transpired at the hostess stand : hostess : great , is all your party here ?
the food was good . good size portions .
their pizza is good , i 'm still trying some more on s. highland , i 'm not going to go rush back here anytime soon , but it is nice to know its there .
our best experience has been with a server named tim . his personality was over the top and made for a fabulous visit .
all fantastic . reasonable prices .
hmm the room : wow lets talk about out dated .
the only bad thing we 're the hostesses but we told the very kind and professional bartender what had happened , he let the manager know and it was all taken care of .
i enjoying having a coffee here with my girlfriend as we both admire the space .
there 's no hard liquor , just beer and wine .
it was pretty good , but portion was small for the price paid ( again `` hipster tax '' ) .
for the steamed rice with meats ( pork chops , chicken , etc ) , i would choose this place .
i really like how the place is decorated and especially enjoyed the giant jenga and connect four .
- they have happy hour for food as well as drinks .
if you 're looking for very poor service and over cooked seafood for over $ 40 a person then you 're in the right place ! if not , save your self the trouble and go some where else !
my mac and cheese was good , but a bit dry because of the amount of bread crumbs .
odd location , next to no frills . looks like it would suck , ugly sign , boring inside .
for the prices you 're paying for , you do get a good deal .
all in a the cafe is very nice .
the food was very good and reasonably priced considering the atmosphere .
for those who like a cocktail with their meal , i think the bloody mary is spot on . other crowd faves include mimosas and some great wines by the glass .
i do n't like breast meat , very dry and tasteless . the fry is still my favourite .
i said i had a pick up and they told me it would be right now and i waited there for 40 minutes when it should 've been 20 minutes .
all i saw , like a mirage on the horizon , was this contemporary brown building , by a pretty lawn patch , on the water .
and the mixed drinks were fantastic !
it is fast and pretty reasonably priced .
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
fancy but somewhat nauseating decor ( i ca n't explain it , but i had problems looking at the ceiling , it has some weird pattern to it ) .
the rooms are a bit dated and good luck doing any makeup in that room because there 's zero lighting .
he also said something along the lines of his business only making money with repeat business .
i always go to glazier 's as it 's right around the corner from me .
we started off with some liquor drinks and i went for their 5 $ jameson special .
i got a glass of some other kind of beer in a nasty glass .
only bummer is that i did n't see any draft beer , only bottles .
only thing is it was a bit expensive . $ 13.95 for a lunch portion little ridiculous but it is what it is .
she tried the happy hour beer and got a kombucha cocktail . i stuck with the happy hour rose ' .
you could see behind the wallpaper .
breakdown : decor : nicely done , made me feel comfortable , `` warehouse chique '' i guess you could call it .
atmosphere was excellent with good jams and people have good conversation .
subtle flavor , but i enjoyed it , the glass it came in was cool , almost like a beer glass haha .
if your gon na go there after 12am on the weekend ? drink up so the wait isnt so disappointing even though they werent `` packed '' per se .
the interior is very outdated and felt kind of dirty .
ordered a shrimp po'boy with cajun fries and jumbalaya -- both were very good and flavorful .
the food was terrible -- very bland . this was the worst part of the whole experience .
the fish fry here is simply amazing .
meat eaters probably will like it better as the meat sauce did look appetizing .
oddly served in a beer mug , this margarita was delicious !
worst part is how long it took to get our food and get out of there .
it 's affordable at $ 6.99 , decent portion , and most importantly tastes really good !
pretty good value for a college town .
for 2 adults to spend nearly 40 bucks ( including a tip ) for mediocre food does n't do it for me .
the fried chicken is delicious though pricey .
service is quick , and dishes are decently sized and priced .
the beer glasses are n't cold .
they also offered free infused water , today it was like and mint .
bathroom is a decent size ... .the full length mirror in the bathroom is really nice , but they do n't have any other mirrors in the room other than the two in the bathroom ... ..which was weird ... .
the decor was very nice , but cluttered with flags and other strange things .
no stars for the tired , drab & dusty interior .
the draft beer selection was lacking but the bottle service was awesome .
we are at the bar and our server was helpful and happy .
my favorite was the mr pineapple beer . it has a nice fruity aftertaste .
the atmosphere is nice , with ethiopian music and a hooka lounge next to the tables . the staff was very nice and they really were some of the nicest staff we encountered in our stay in las vegas .
the actual service was below mediocre and the food tasted like dog food .
we each started off with summer cocktails- between us we had the strawberry basil mojito , the blueberry lemonade ( i think that 's what it was- it was very very sweet ) , and some concoction made with clementines and summer in a glass .
i only wish they had a better wine choice for happy hour .
when i ordered the noodles stressing veggies only , the waitress was nice enough to ask if i was vegan or not , and made sure that it was ok to use fish sauce and oyster sauce in the preparation of the dish .
they were not set up on time and they kind of messed up the floor plan , the numbering of the tables were just off and they did n't account for the table for the bar .
he was n't terribly rude , just acted snobby .
the people there were also kind and the dining room was roomy .
on top of that they bring you in for a 30 dollar restaurant week special .
the food is below mediocre and higher prices .
food was fine but i would say the experience was mediocre all around given the price ( about $ 50 a person ) . felt the experience was worth maybe 30 $ .
the clients are happy ordering another bottle of wine and deserts .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
my hollandaise was bland and crab cakes tasted premade and had an odd underlying flavor that i could n't even finish .
the food is absolutely mouth-watering .
i normally do n't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature .
still , good food for a cheap price and when you are on a budget this place is pretty sweet .
actually amazing food here & the staff super attentive .
we rented out a room in the back that also had a patio attached , which was perfect for the beautiful evening .
how can you go wrong with a $ 13.00 dinner buffet ?
food was delicious and prices were inexpensive . food was fast and hot !
i received practically no chicken .
the price was right ( 2 of us ate for about 10 $ ) .
there was a crude and lewd drawing hanging on the chandelier and there was not adequate towels linens or pillows .
the alaskan roll was n't all that impressive but i did n't expect it to be being that it was in the `` regular roll '' section and not one of their `` special rolls '' .
for desert i ordered the salted caramel which was so good but it was runny inside .
was cold which i did n't like that much .
but it is super cute and like a art gallery , and the women in their were awesome .
i did n't try the beer , but it looked like decent alcohol choices .
we all ordered hibachi and some sushi rolls which were both fantastic !
the bun was stale which is why it was falling apart . the burger patty had no seasoning and was cold .
not really sure about the music that was playing but an overall nice experience .
they also poured water into cups for us which was nice but spilled half of it on the table and got it all over our pants .
also , the `` dirty curtains '' people talk about on here is a real thing .
it was bland too .
no worries , well that hour passed we just wanted to check on the status so we asked and she said it 's going to be longer than she originally told us . okay , no problem we decide to continue to wait .
the pork sausage was amazing .
the supposedly manager `` laura '' talks very badly in front of people in spanish thinking people do n't speak it . if i could give 0 stars i totally would .
we actually really enjoyed our visit here .
interesting that they charge ridiculous prices too .
prices are quite reasonable too .
you can go get a decent meal at olive garden for $ 14 bucks .
prices are moderate - i think our bill was just over $ 20 .
everything would have been fine if they had just tried to right the order , instead they called me a liar and insinuated that i was trying to get free food .
not just good . not decent .
i love sitting by the fire . one tip , as a typical booth sitter , the chairs are awesome .
the outdoor seating is a nice touch on nice days and it 's right in the middle of the district so the location is solid .
only redeeming quality was the garlic aioli sauce which looked and tasted alot like garlic butter ... you wo n't hear me complain though .
a weak beer selection with the bar running out of the crafts ?
they only have one size ( 16 inch ) starting at $ 18 .
took 20 minutes to get drinks and all meals came out at different times . over easy eggs where over hard and meals came without tortillas .
luke wholey 's is a great place to stop in when shopping in the strip on the weekends .
aside from the food , the atmosphere is gorgeous here !
the lighting seemed quite dark to me , not sure if that is appropriate for a bbq joint .
in fact , the whole meal could be described that way . flavorful without any one thing overpowering the entire dish .
super delicious modern japanese food . intimate , casual setting .
nice people , good food , reasonable prices .
the servers were short and directly insulting .
i liked the cosy feel of the space and the service was great and very welcoming .
all of it was cold !
hit and miss ! the first time i went here it was delicious , affordable , and authentic tasting ( included a pad thai ) .
i only wish i 'd found this place months ago .
now , i have only been here on a weekend night , so i do n't know how it is during the day .
she said she was sorry and forgot to put the order in .
i never have to force myself to drink anything with tequila in it , but their house margarita just did n't taste right .
the chicken was excellent perfectly cooked .
friend and i went to cleveland for the weekend to see a couple shows and we were amazed with the food we had while there . first night we went to lola and it was incredible .
the backyard has a fabulous play structure and is the perfect place for kids to play .
prices are decent and food is excellent .
food was good and a reasonable price .
beers were ok , but they were bottled beers , so it would be pretty difficult for them to ruin that .
i liked the vodka martini selection , very nice though some of the flavors did n't work out that well .
started off with a caipirinha ( traditional brazilian cocktail ) that made made perfectly- the right mixture of lime , sugar and cachaca .
while there , we ordered two alcoholic drinks and they were both delicious .
( we ordered the 64 ounce monster drink ) overall a great place to stop by for some decent late night food .
i am pretty loyal to the bbq pork wonton vegatable noodle but the classic wor wonton is great as well . the broth is very good , vegetables have always been really fresh , and the hot sauce is top shelf .
we ordered beers from a so-so beer list , and they were out of that beer , ordered a different beer , out of it too .
i was disappointed that they have no draft beers .
the carpet is disgusting with garbage all over the place and the utensils and tablecloths with questionable at best . the bright lighting emphasized the filth .
our favorite dishes are the crispy egg rolls , pho thai , house crispy chicken , salt pepper calamari and the best house fried rice !
it 's good fast food , at decent prices .
and reasonably priced for what appears to be a very expensive steakhouse .
people moaning about portions or cost need to go to nakama and have crap rolls for $ 10 .
i planned on ordering the $ 3 tacos but was told you ca n't get anything taken off the tacos for $ 3 , you must pay full price on them .
now with school being out i did get an extremely good deal on this hotel , i had a rate of $ 77 and they do have the $ 15 resort fee but every hotel nowadays has that .
seemed that the margaritas were the specialty but was not impressed , plus it came in a beer pint glass.. ?
we are n't looking for anything in return , we are just trying to warn future guest about your horrible customer service .
trying to flag down a waiter even when the place is practically empty is almost impossible unless you 're yelling waiter !
i prefer going there for lunch since it 's not as busy and the staff is a lot more attentive .
beer was awful and is n't even in a pint glass .
the interior is airy with a good amount of seating ; the decoration is rustic and hip .
graveyard server is absolutely shitty , sat for almost 15 minutes and got no service what so ever . it 'd be one thing if it was busy but there was only one other table in the entire place ( sitting right next to us ) and he went up to them , even though they were seated way after us and still completely ignored us .
they have a pretty good beer list , though nothing on draft .
it has a beautiful patio with tons of shade .
it was very bland .
it 's pretty convenient location , reasonably priced and the food 's decent .
i am a out of state student and they sure do make you feel at home .
the food overall was good and the kool aid combination drink was so sweet ( and delicious ) that even after adding a full cup of water , it was no noticeable difference in sweetness .
lol i also had the sweet tea cocktail interesting !
idk what these poor reviews are about .
food was pretty good but portion for price paid was way way off .
the wine was very good .
i found the host when i walked in to be rude .
the only thing i was n't into was the decor , i can see the charm in it but it felt dusty and old without charm .
it 's totally faded .
i 've only run across a couple who could use an attitude adjustment or basic customer service training .
like everybody has stated , ugly paintings , furniture , wall paper , furniture , etc .
the price was also very reasonable as my meal cost only about 10 dollars .
as for the drinks : -after all , the bar was just calling out to me and although i had hoped to see more beers on tap , unfortunately , a majority of their beer list was bottled .
very friendly . very attentive .
very busy . staff was friendly and attentive .
great atmosphere , nice seats that my friends enjoyed as it is quite private and makes the dining experience better .
we had the foie gras ravioli and one of the salads for starters ; both were fantastic . our entrees were the salmon and filet .
great food and friendly staff .
service from the kitchen was slow but our waitress took great care of us while we waited .
great food , reasonable prices .
and the entire time i was n't given a menu not asked if i wanted anything .
i asked for a hefeweizen but no ; they have 30 beers on tap including 6 different ipas , but not a hefeweizen in the house .
we drank pretty heavily and only walked out paying $ 25 bucks , a relative bargain .
get an appetizer , some wine , a dessert and it is a perfect night .
the prices were reasonable .
tequila selection was pretty good but the bartenders were clearly hired for other credentials than tequila knowledge , if you catch my drift .
flavorful , clean and fairly priced .
it has pretty nice prices like for the weekly special has a cut down price .
not that i drink beer but they have huge beer selection , over a 130 beers on tap .
caffe boa remains a great choice for happy hour : great drinks , great wine selection , great apps .
beer selection was large however , so i 'm sure beer drinkers enjoy that . i do not really drink beer though .
not sure if it was the side of the restaurant where we were in but i found the ambiance to be a bit depressing - the dim lighting , greyish walls ( with mysterious stains on them ) took away from my experience at the restaurant .
the bartender was wonderful and those drinks went down entirely too quickly .
glad we chose this place for our last night in pheonix .
really poor customer service in my opinion , we planned on driving over 45 minutes to get there as a surprise for one of the guests coming .
it 's kind of depressing .
the drinks were perfect .
but the last two times the chicken has been dry and over cooked .
my martini was made to perfection , and the scotch selection for my boyfriend was also great .
( warning : the entire place is very dark and it is difficult to read the menu without glasses and/or a flashlight . )
the food was really good and reasonably priced for a healthy option .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
the pizza itself was greasy and fairly untasty .
i did not want anything free , i just wanted acknowledgement .
when we went we were told they did n't have any chicken ready , so we waited and the food was so bad that we threw it away .
the drinks are so cheap .
a great price too , $ 6.25 for the combo .
and , they are so nice and friendly .
i find this horribly unacceptable for a $ 50 steak .
the lighting was a little bright but maybe that 's just me .
prices are reasonable ( not the cheapest but not super expensive ) .
asked waitress to change it out and she said salt gets hard so just hit the shaker . still could n't get it to come out .
it really was n't that bright ( bright finish , but immediate taste was dark ) .
plenty of tables inside with good tv 's as well .
2 always makes it seem like the food was awful or something , which it was not ( except for the fries - they were n't good ) .
kinda price , but fair to the location
unfortunately after 20 minutes of having the waiter/waitress bring us the wrong food ( yeah ... before they took our drink order ) and watching or server help older groups use the new checkout platform on the tables ... we were pretty fed up .
they only had two people working and it seemed like they were behind .
my first sip was a little bitter but it quickly smoothed out the more of it that i drank and i enjoyed it .
their menu is delicious and decently priced for what you 're getting .
even the margaritas were bad ( pre-mixed ) .
for how much we paid , you would think they would be constantly replenishing not only the food but also the condiments .
it was absolutely heaven !
the lighting was nice , i could see my food but was n't blinded by lights .
we also enjoyed a couple cocktails at the bar during happy hour .
the atmosphere is trendy and comfortable .
if you 're craving for hawaiian food , i highly recommend going to l & l instead of this place .
again , like i said , the waitress that ended up taking care of us was super understanding , took everything we told her that we never got off of our bills , and did apologize .
very inventive , imaginative , creative , and super fun !
you are always greeted with a smile and them being courteous .
the coffee here is really good and it 's in a convenient location , but there is n't much seating and the wireless internet does n't work very well . the atmosphere is kind of cold rather than the warm cozy feel i like to have in a coffee place .
all we ordered were two eggs over easy with ham croquettes ( those things were horrible ) our cuban bread was so hard it was more of a cracker .
great wine selection as well .
my son loved the egg rolls and fried ravioli .
sadly i did n't get a beer .
very reasonably priced as well !
happy hour offers a great menu and drinks .
to end the night i highly recommend the chocolate pie which has a toasted almond crust and creamy , chocolate mouse filling .
the price is reasonable .
the broth was very salty and oily , and to my husband and i , it tasted like chicken broth .
we ordered bottled beers -- their beer selection is good , i will give them that .
the food was great , the service was exceptional and the atmosphere made you feel welcomed .
the inside is a quirky rustic , which they pull off very well .
i had their sausage penne which was superb .
they still have $ 5.95 lunch meal and it 's pretty filling .
disappointed . i love fuzzy 's , used to go all the time when i lived in tx .
i love this place !
this place is moderately pricey .
the food is always good , always extremely hot , and always full of flavor .
service can be a little slow , but they take their time plating it nicely . watch your step when going to the bathroom though , it 's hard to see the caution tape if you 're paying attention .
what you end up with is a dry , skinny piece of meat that resembles beef jerky .
when the food came out , i noticed that the raw fish was not cut in the traditional way .
the decor is cozy , interesting and complements the service and product .
our waitress did n't seem to care that my steak was untouched when she took my plate away ... if they do n't care enough to ask then i ca n't be bothered to complain , especially not enough to make a scene of it when i 'm with a large group .
the staff were all very friendly as well .
the shrimp pieces were lacking and there were far too many onions with my noodles .
the staffed blamed the 40min wait on a 20 % filled restaurant on the chef being slow !
as for the drinks : -after all , the bar was just calling out to me and although i had hoped to see more beers on tap , unfortunately , a majority of their beer list was bottled .
i actually liked the dated decor . i did not like the dated staff .
on a positive note , the atmosphere is very cool !
had good variety of chinese food , some sushi ( i was little afraid of sashimi but reg sushi was good ) frying station , ice cream machine with cone .
the calamari was amazing , my arnold palmer was mixed with just the right amounts of lemonade & ice tea .
a bit overpriced ( i paid $ 10 for basically a chicken sandwich ? )
the setting of this restaurant is nice !
the only thing positive is the decor .
i told her i waited a total of 13 minutes in two different calls just to receive zero help .
you can easily find as good or better for about 30 % less $ .
pretty ok selection of beer bottles and draught which is what i was after .
no doubt , it is expensive but it 's great value for the money .
great food and fairly priced .
but food is excellent and cheap .
well , got off to a bad start . we were told that the wait would be 30 minutes , was closer to and hour and fifteen .
nice décor and service and i like the faint euro dance music in the background .
beer - the beer selection was nothing special and they do n't serve it in a cold glass .
it 's a gorgeous place to even look at .
so glad i finally got to eat here .
is everything delicious and reasonably prices , heck yes .
the food is cool . but the ambiance is what i love .
this place is all about quality , best tasting chicken strips i have ever had . the baked mac is awesome .
we both had wraps which came with plenty of meat . i had fries ... coworker had salad , we were both happy with our selection .
prices are reasonable considering the quality is so good .
$ 12 pizza and then another $ 8 for 3 different toppings seemed like a lot considering how cheap pizza is to make .
after tip ... i paid $ 54 for six mediocre tacos , one beer and one margarita .
the first time i was here , it was really awesome !
we got the groupon dinner deal for two and it included 1 hour free drinks ( wine , beer , and caipirinha ) and one desert .
only good thing is the bacon corn but even the bacon appears undercooked .
the house margarita was fine because i like weak drinks .
fancy but somewhat nauseating decor ( i ca n't explain it , but i had problems looking at the ceiling , it has some weird pattern to it ) .
good selection . prices were affordable .
i ordered the lamb vindaloo and the princess ordered the chicken vindaloo .
no tap beer , no blended drinks for a decent margaritas and out of steak for tacos .
they were fairly good but slightly stale .
the dude is a tool and super rude to customers .
the portions are tiny , and the prices are very high .
the tables have hard wooden benches that are a bit uncomfortable .
service was great and i was on the patio .
with the 1st course we also had the sparkling pineapple sake which was very good .
priced in the $ 6.00 to $ 9.00 range , not bad price for the food served .
the wine selection was fantastic !
the food is great the service is great and the founder brian came and made our experience all the better .
just had the chicken wrap . really well done wrap with exceptional flavours .
the drinks ( cocktails ) i have ordered have also been very good .
it was pretty pitiful .
i had heard so many wonderful things from so many people that i was very excited to try it .
the pool is a reason to stay here alone - the lazy river just does n't get old .
add to that a happy hour and it carries a loud bar atmosphere and not one of a restaurant .
which by the way cost a dollar per each plate -__- the food was horrible guys .
i 've had better , food was mediocre .
the scenery overlooking the city is beautiful . the country feel , music , deco , live bull and of course the slide make it the place to visit !
place is ridiculous . wont last .
my wife and i celebrated our 5th anniversary this weekend . the ambience , staff and food made it a very memorable experience .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
for $ 15 , you are getting a decent portion for the poutines .
their artisan bread is excellent , and the portion size is reasonable .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
now for the pasta , each pasta was very unique , one person stuck with the traditional spaghetti which was ok , reason being there was not enough sauce , and this is coming from someone who does n't like that much sauce on anything .
i wish the owners would realize they are disturbing their customers .
the place was a little expensive but not outrageous except that $ 9 for a dessert seems high .
we love this place for breakfast .
fish sauce mix was alright , nothing special .
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
i also had the midnight gaucho cocktail which was tasty and strong !
beer selection was large however , so i 'm sure beer drinkers enjoy that . i do not really drink beer though .
this place is amazing and very accommodating ! we were just passing through vegas and consider ourselves very lucky for finding this place .
overall it was a great place to eat and a nice place to take out of towners to get a view of camelback .
my grilled chicken salad was good .
it started out bad when we had to wait about 5 to 10 minutes just to be seated for lunch .
yes it was good but for the price we paid about $ 20 something dollars for two cheesesteaks and some orders of fries .
not a bad bar .
quite a steal for their three course meal lunch special at 25 dollars per person !
the ambiance : just cozy and romantic a nice place to chat up with two or 3 friends or a loved one .
for those four dishes , the total came to around $ 50 .
highly recommended if you want to grab a quick and cheap eat !
the explanation in the little `` true food '' book about the decor and the feng shui was a little pretentious , but whatever .
one friend just got ginger ale and they only filled the glass half full ?
i ordered the fish fillet it was crispy and delicious . the spicy fries tasted great also .
i do find it amusing how `` hipster '' the establishment seeks to feel with tattooed employees and rustic decor ... yet much of the clientele is overtly b & t , sigh ( not dive 's fault ) .
tap water was filtered and good , nice hot teas ( we had green and jasmine , both were excellent ) .
i did n't order any beer or cocktails , but looked like a great selection of beer .
environment is just trendy enough without over doing it and also cozy .
they are meaty , flavorful and juicy ! they are tender and i was pleasantly surprised !
while a dark restaurant may signify expensive , they just do n't do `` dark '' right .
everything that was supposed to be cold was ice cold .
only thing i did n't like about the room and the hallway was the decor .
great wine to accompany .
but is it fairly good and reasonable ?
the veal was a little tough , but acceptable .
i realized because manager ashley looked up my husband on fb ( i do n't have my actual name on my account ) to let him know my wallet was there . when he went to pick it up , she asked for id to make sure she was giving basically all of my life 's information to the right person .
( note : for being such a upscale and nice hotel with a `` reputation '' you would think their employees uniforms would be more elegant and classy than the pepto bismol skirt suit the hostesses wear .
food how can i be paying this price for such good food ?
pricing for all you can eat is reasonable , $ 8.50
we had great service , our waitress was knowledgeable , friendly and had great recommendations .
they always employ hot djs to spin their magic and pump energy into the bar with vintage and current music hits .
i know most beer drinkers prefer piss like corona and budweiser and heineken , but us beer snobs are kind of left in the cold it seemed .
prices are very reasonable as well .
the kale salad is bright with just a hint of lemon is a perfect companion with the short rib perfectly braised .
there interior design is `` interesting '' , not sure why there so into the zebra print but to each their own .
the samosas were great , but the real star was the masala fries .
the atmosphere is something like an up-scale cafeteria , boasting fairly nice furnishings and decor , but little or no privacy / intimacy .
my favorite steak house in town !
the ambiance of the place is very cute and cozy .
nothing super fancy , but healthy , good , food at reasonable prices .
they have a good beer selection but unfortunately the beers we ordered were flat .
prices are very fair also .
reasonably priced and very good .
had nachos which were surprisingly meh . bar tap choice was kind of limited , and they did n't have all on tap .
food : this was unfortunately a mediocre brunch in terms of presentation and taste .
this place has an amazing vibe .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
my hibiscus iced tea was simply delicious . solid 5 stars .
my friend got the mango iced tea and i got an iced coffee . my coffee was delicious , just as i expected , but my friends iced tea was even better .
the sushi was not good either .
wine list is very small .
this place is awesome . ijs
flavorful , everything cooked perfectly .
finally our food came , yet a different server , not the one assigned to us .
the pour was horrible and the beer was flat .
i opted for the bottomless wine pairing dinner that was absolutely delicious .
we did n't get much of a view since reservations are only for indoor dining , but the experience was still great .
$ 10 . its a good deal .
i was really impressed with the place in all aspects : lighting , decor , ambiance , entertainment , service but most of all the food ... i mean really like the 'steak frites ' were amazing !
the beef chunks are by far the best thing we had along with the traditional bulgogi .
food was n't good and based on the place and the quality , plates should be $ 6 not $ 15 . that 's what you would expect to pay for a really nice food and a nice restaurant in phoenix .
the baked chicken is always over cooked and the collard greens are filled with stalks .
great great rolls . awesome combos .
the floor was wet and dirty , and no tp or paper towels in the women 's room .
the pan searing was ... weird . i felt like the chicken was kinda rubbery and flavorless .
what more needs to be said ? keep in mind that , for better or worse , drinks here are served in packaged containers , not a soda fountain .
nice to look at , but so cloyingly sweet it tasted like hoisin and plum sauce gone crazy .
service was great and friendly and the atmosphere was a great balance of trendy , sophisticated and comfortable .
decently priced and service was good .
it feels kind of creepy .
these servers looked dumpy and just bizarre styling !
not what i expected but cool , def casual .
i have had my indian friends make homemade indian food for me , and i think kama 's food is seriously lacking indian spices and flavours .
the beer list was disappointing .
very good food at reasonable prices .
fantastic apps and i had the ribs which were completely unique mediterranean style .
price - decently priced .
the guacamole is priced at like 2-4 avocados , 400 % or so markup , not bad .
the sushi chef was very nice and sushi was fresh and good . i loved their ahi poki and the nigiris were good too .
with games on the table and music in the background , i was ready for a great meal .
good quality good at very reasonable prices .
it was hard to talk to each other and bad dining experience .
i do n't drink beer , but my friends do and they said their beers were just ok , nothing spectacular .
today , the hubby , 2 of our friends , & i tried this location of over easy for the very first time and we all had a great time .
the ginger peach drink was refreshing : ) travis , our server , was very personable .
the texture was strange . it was kind of chewy .
this is a great restaurant for a nice lunch with friends , i would definitely recommend .
from the get go service was awesome and i was quickly handed a menu , water , and asked if i needed any explanation .
very reasonably priced check it out .
the owner , gus , seems to love his job and welcomes everyone in .
i do have a bit of an issue with the price ... a large chicken shawarma and drink can cost over $ 10 , which is a bit pricey for lunch .
drinks were average ... i had a couple skinny margs and they tasted pretty watered down , nothing special .
the decor was done very nicely , but they ruined it with the lighting .
weird rolls were extremely expensive and everything was spicy .
the walls have splatter of food , there is trash on the ground , stains on the ground , and it just looks dirty .
the management seems to realize when there are issues , as they have provided free appetizers and such when we were unhappy .
it was ok beer was not that great tasting you ca n't even buy a small glass of beer without buying a flight .
did n't feel uncomfortable and parking was plentiful and good lighting .
the food is really good and priced very reasonable .
the women 's bathroom was covered in pee . i stepped in it , and now my pants and shoes smell of someone 's nasty pee .
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
the staff was very attentive and the restaurant itself very warm and welcoming .
they have a casual atmosphere with a great selection of drinks ( regular bar stuff , a great craft beer list , plus everything from infused vodkas to seasonal sangrias to $ 60 glasses of aged bourbon ) .
i also remembered that the white rice as our base was n't very good . it either was n't cooked right or the quality of the rice was n't very good .
i think they probably closed at midnight . i do n't know if the restaurant hours on yelp are posted by the store , but the incorrect info is why i gave it only one star .
i asked for recommendation or what people usually get , server had no clue ( i 'm sorry but every restaurant i 've been to , even new servers are trained what the signature or popular dishes are .
very sad to experience such open racism .
the cost is more than reasonable and i would pay significantly more for a comparable meal at lots of burger places .
the pricing was n't so bad either around $ 10 a person .
this dish had a strain of hair on it i was not impressed .
the waitress seemed like she did n't give a damn about our business , it was weird .
ambiance kind of sucks .
great place for romantic dinner , inside or out .
you 'd think with all the money they are making off their raised prices they 'd be able to afford more kitchen staff to bust out orders faster .
the place was n't busy but it did seem to take an incredible amount of time to be seated in a dead restaurant , with signs all over place telling us to wait to be seated .
they have only two or three beers on draft and the rest come in a bottle .
i can understand it 's not an easy job but when you got nice customers do n't take your frustrations out on us .
halcyon is a beautiful restaurant , there is a patio that screams , `` cocktails . ''
really must pay attention . the restaurant is cozy , clean , and the manager who greeted me was friendly ; along with the staff .
the food was very good i got the shrimp and scallops mushrooms and the carrots and rice and yummy sauce . it was very tasty and cooked well .
when we tried to order drinks , the were out of the only draft beer , negro modelo ... and 3-4 of the bottle beers , and my 1st tequila choice ... then the bartender actually told me the hefeweizen bottle beer was `` just '' like the 2x ipa they were out of ... .really ?
the biscuit was stale , the chicken was flavorless ... disappointing .
i just love this place !
plus u do not have to just get a philly cheese steak they also have kabob 's , fried chicken , gyro 's , burgers , chicken wings , salad 's and a kids menu plus u can get pizza .
they are perfect- buttery , rich , flaky , and if there is filling , the filling is not too sweet , with just the right amount .
thank you management for your response ... just for that you get 4 stars ... i know it 's months later but i certainly will give it another try but your attentiveness to customer service is exceptional and means a lot more than the food .
what bothered me most was the markup on the small milk to pay $ 1.75 was a bit ridiculous .
every saturday and sunday they are doing outdoor bbq events , i highly recommend stopping by to eat and talk with the owner !
the restaurant was almost empty but it took approximately 5 minutes to be seated . the girl sat us at a table that had food residue all over it .
only gave four stars because 5.25 for a cheese slice is steep and this should n't be listed as $ . but i guess that 's what you get in vegas .
we also had margaritas which you could hardly taste anything but a pre-made margarita mix .
the toast that came was a bit over cooked , making it very dry & chewy .
the only downside is a burger and fries cost around $ 20 .
the lights gave the place an uncomfortable feel .
but i ca n't get over the fact that my pulled pork burrito with noodles tasted like nothing , absolutely nothing .
the place is a little bit in need of an update ; the decor is not bad or worn out , but the patterned carpet just makes it feel dated .
there was an open metal lattice wall but unfortunately the smoking lounge was right across the walkway .
there are too many great food location in vegas so i recommend you skip this one !
with some subtle lighting this place would be great but i felt like i was in a parking lot - you could not turn towards the one light without getting a painful beam of light in your eyes .
my chicken sandwich was microwaved and rubbery ( the whole thing was nuked - even the lettuce was hot ) and the sauce tasted like spaghetti o 's sauce poured over the chicken .
i waited over 30 minutes for a chicken strip basket . the person at the window was very unfriendly and had my card for about 10 minutes .
be sure to stop by !
we were skeptical . we had a great experience at the bar starting with the bartender making an off menu martini that my wife loved - vodka , lemongrass syrup , chili pepper syrup and pineapple juice .
the drinks are heavenly and being a bartender myself , that is a huge compliment . the happy hour prices are great and the appetizer quite delicious .
at the end of the night , those `` free '' sake bombs were on the bill .
their cocktails were wonderful as well : )
for a family of 3 to dine for under $ 50 was great !
for $ 19 , it was not bad for prime downtown location .
and i think the price is very reasonable .
i was waited on by a red-headed waitress , she was rude and unpleasant .
oh , and reeeeally weird art in the girl 's bathroom ... .
the soup ( i think it was cream of cauliflower ) was way too watery , not creamy enough at all , and a bit bland .
food is average but you ca n't beat the people watching . make sure you get a table on the patio close to the rail .
the chicken was super juicy as well .
there are a variety of flavors of wings and they are all very good .
all of the staff and the owner , sandy are welcoming and warm .
a 26 dollar bill for breakfast for 2 is a bit excessive .
love getting a 32 oz drink as i drink a lot of unsweetened tea .
you could see behind the wallpaper .
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
had no flavor as far as a good deep dish crust . they used a low quality cheese and the sausage had miniscule little pieces not clumps of quality sausage .
lots of really great premade food , a deli for made to order food , and lots of choices of grab and go items .
great restaurant & giuseppe is a phenomenal waiter .
unfortunately i did not like it and ordered a bottled domestic .
i even once tried a pretty awesome jalapeno margarita but honestly i would rather drink the beer .
fast , cheap and good .
the beer was decent and drinkable .
all for a reasonable price .
the service was friendly and attentive .
i went around asking the entire crew what they would rate this place ... all of them either said 1 or 1.5 out of 5 stars.. when we got in , we had to wait for 45 mins to get a table ... i mean that 's understandable given the fact that we were a large group ... once seated ... .
price seems high for what it is .
they play nice jazz and blues music and the food is flavorful .
desserts were all superb .
the wines are pricey but the wine list certainly appeared complete in our ( experienced ) eyes .
my friend who called in said the person on the phone had a strong accent and it was easy to tell who it was so she complained .
we had to call them , and i 'm not sure if they forgot us or what happened .
it was a great amuse bouche .
the decor inside is simple and the restaurant is clean .
prices are reasonable - considering its on the strip - and it 's lobster .
i went for the rajun cajun spice and chose `` mild '' for my range of spiciness . it had a good amount of heat and tons of flavor !
the tamales were dry and cold inside , and the wrappers were cold , indicating they are prepared ahead of time and then microwaved .
firstly : the restaurant name does n't give enough credit to the classy interior .
when the server delivered the coffee with a creamer that was curdled , our guest had to stand up and go find the manager to get a good creamer for her coffee .
they had a great drink selection and some cool cocktails .
the table are nice and roomy . the chairs are so big and comfortable , you can sit there for hours enjoying your meal and drinks .
good food . reasonable prices .
the patio is very nice and somewhat secluded while the inside has more of a pub feel with live music on some nights .
bartender saw me , but decided her conversation with the regulars ( who all had drinks ) and cutting fruit was more important . it cracked me up when i was leaving , a hostess told me thanks for coming .
price was reasonable , about $ 22 for the two of us .
that was really creepy !
the servers are very nice and knowledgeable about the dishes .
the sourdough crust was light and tasty and great on its own .
nice crowd on the patio .
the mai tai drinks were phenomenal - not too sweet , the right amount of rums ( perfect dark rum float ) , completely refreshing .
they would do to engage customers a bit more to warm up the place .
the portions were huge .
they have only a few beers on tap , a pretty good choice of bottled beer and a basic bar stock .
however , the mac and cheese was pretty lackluster and tasted like buttered noodles .
greasy , tasteless meat , only used one taco instead of two , so they just fell apart as soon as you tried to pick them up .
the interior was very dull with pretty much no decor at all .
the frybread and biscuits came with an amazing cinnamon butter , which i highly recommend .
absolutely fabulous . the fresh pasta is incredible .
the men 's restroom was filthy with water or something on the floor .
40 dollars per person i think is a little ridiculous for this buffet .
very fresh , and good value for the price .
we decided to be adventurous and also ordered the chicken milanese torta which was absolute heaven .
i paid $ 8 for the salad and then another $ 7 for the skewer of chicken .
love the fresh garlic that they used to season them .
two of us had the mimosa with grapefruit juice and st. germain and found the drink to be very bitter .
the pizza and boneless wings are awesome ! the crispy crust is delicious , and the flavor combination of cheese , sauce , and dough was perfect .
place was decorated great . quiet atmosphere and romantic .
i had the seasonal summer salad , caprese chicken salad , and it was very tasty . it had fresh tomatoes , mozzarella , and a balsamic dressing .
we opted for the meatball parpadelle , all of the sides and the crispy chicken .
i am not vegetarian and i loved this restaurant ! their faux meat dishes were out of this world !
nice to have craft beer on tap and bottle . should n't be in a chilled glass though .
it 's a little family owned joint and they are absolutely the nicest people .
the ambience is excellent and the server was very nice and super friendly .
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
about 32 total and i 've tried 12 so far .
nice wine list and good bartender . definite recommend .
the wait staff is superb , friendly and attentive .
great pours of alcohol , well cooked steaks , and a nice choice of appetizers .
had a blast and plan to go back ! wish it was warm enough to go swimming , the pool area looked awesome !
my wife and i went during happy hour , and we ordered all kinds of appetizers and martinis .
honestly the best selection i have ever seen for an all you can eat sushi menu .
okay but i see potential to improve for sure !
we had many dishes and everything was absolutely perfect .
weird decor and bad food .
the price point was n't bad either - $ 50 + tip for two entrees and two drinks .
the flavors were n't memorable , rather bland .
rose d and i ordered two venti drinks and they were ready absurdly quickly .
the prices were reasonable .
food was not bad but the prices are outrageous for the experience .
room was dirty , lots of hair , drips on ceiling while showering , bathroom sink did not drain at all , noisy , carpet was stained , room smelled badly of smoke , not sure how it 's actually non smoking .
it was practically inedible and we felt disappointed and ripped off .
it was a bit difficult to understand the employees describing items , but fortunately i knew what i wanted .
we were very disappointed , especially for the price ( $ 56 ) for a small steak ( compare to $ 48 for the filet ) . we spent way too much money on a below average meal and service .
first time and had a great meal with great service .
paint peeling off the walls , chips and discoloration in the floor , counters messed up , but the food is great .
the bed was hard as a rock and the bathroom had ugly overhead fluorescent lighting and could have easily been a bathroom at a mediocre motel .
it was great and substantial ! four topping large and out the door under $ 18 .
i have heard so many good things about this place i had to try it .
our server was very attentive and very knowledgeable .
love the free lychee lemonade drink free when you check in on yelp
it 's more than filling and tasty with a reasonable price .
then you have a roll , some salad , and of course their delicious chicken .
base on the service of customer if i have i choice of 0 star i would totally give it this restaurant .
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
a nice restaurant/pub , the decor is out of this world !
i also ordered a glass of champagne ( they have a very large selection of beer and wine , even sake ! )
interior designer should be shot though - eclectic design that 's incredibly confused and close to distasteful .
lack of liquor is disappointing but the price of the price makes up for it .
nice selection of wine , and excellent service .
the exterior is unassuming , but the space inside is clean and spacious .
the prices are extremely reasonable .
it was our first time here and i 'm guessing we had that awkward look when we walking in because we were asked if it was our first time there .
great service ! huge portions .. the vegetable omelette is delicious .
their breakfast soufflés are great especially the spinach one .
the dip tasted as if it had beans rather than beef , but we liked it .
ordered the steak oscar and the single entree was enormous . the twin filets were excellent , the crabcake delicious and the golden mashed potatoes divine ( and generously portioned ) .
the lighting was a bit dim , but still enough light that i was n't squinting .
kind of expensive but good quality .
they were perfectly balanced cocktails - most people would have a hard time even tasting the gin .
food : the chicken kebabs were really good : moist , juicy and flavourful . the chicken pakoras along with the eggplant were just average .
for the most part , the service is highly efficient and the staff is attentive .
the actual restaurant itself is beautiful .
our total was about $ 180 , which is reasonable for the food and experience .
the drink selection was so lame .
i could n't quite tell which flavor is too strong , maybe it 's sesame oil .
especially for the price !
it 's needlessly slow and over-the-top snooty .
i ordered a dirty martini ( received a straight-up martini with a twist of lemon ) the boyfriend ordered a long island iced tea ( we all tried to figure out what kind of drink they actually made him tasted like bourbon ) but i could live with the drink mishap i 'm happy i had my vodka .
the ocean roll is amazing .
pretty much every item on the menu is amazing .
on top of that , they have an amazing tea selection and fountain drink !
great food but a little more expensive than i 'm used to . i guess you pay for the quality .
at the bar the shots were puny but the beer was cold .
only weird thing is the ridiculously short doors in the women 's bathroom so people can see you pee . pro tip : there 's a stand a lone handicap bathroom , use that instead .
the location is small and not a huge place to sit down with large groups inside .
the great wrap and plantains can not be beat ! i have tried the chicken with sides , as well as the viva chicken salad and there is no fault that can be found .
dance floor was too crowded and the music was n't good .
i was disappointed that they have no draft beers .
one final note : the draft list was wonderful ! there were lots of excellent choices and flights were only $ 8 , which will keep me coming back for sure .
juice was n't bad but the food is all microwaved and unseasoned . will not be returning .
my boyfriend and i came here for a date night and had a wonderful dinner .
moreover , even if i was not allergic , this was just rude behavior .
and it 's not just a gimmick , despite its cute name and design .
definitely satisfied with my experience .
visited this restaurant last week and had to make sure to share what a great experience it was .
yes , i know its dancing water with stupid light bulbs shining through .
prices for their meals are very reasonable considering the quality .
the rooms are spacious and cozy . i like that its connected to the palazzo and their are shops , restaurants , and entertainment indoors to avoid bad weather .
pretty average place . alligator appetizer was overly greasy , hard to tell what kind of meat was in there .
there was n't much of a tap selection . also i do n't know if we picked 6 bad beers or if the taps were bad but none of the beers were good .
it 's literally tucked in the back corner of a fairly deserted strip mall , which is also surrounded by pretty much nothing .
sometimes pricey old hotels impress with their beautiful lobbies and lounges , but disappoint with tiny guest rooms and outdated decor .
the waitress said they do n't have happy hour and i had said , then why do you advertise it on your website . she said `` i do n't know , but we do n't have it anymore . ''
good selection of beer and helpful bartender . unfortunately , they 'd just tapped out 2 of the 3 beers we chose .
the bartender did n't know the beers they had on tap and seemed pretty out of it .
be aware however , that although the veal sandwich is advertised as only 6 dollars , each topping is an additional $ 1.00 or $ 1.50 , which made my sandwich come to $ 11.30 after tax .
does n't need to be fancy just the worn out booths were very uncomfortable .
the brisket was a thin dry crispy slice covered in bbq sauce , did n't even notice it in my bag at first . out of the whole order a side coleslaw was nice ( probably the worst compliment to a bbq place )
it 's older and seems wore out . what drove me crazy was how thin the walls are , i could hear phone conversations , toilets flushing , and the guy snoring all night .
the atmosphere is great too , sort of lounge like with drinks as well- a great place to chill and eat vegan !
i never really liked quail , it just looks unappetizing .
this place is already a new favorite .
i highly recommend this place !
i ordered it with a fried egg on top which i also highly recommend .
i recall them years ago that was then flavourless meat ( the whataburger ) cheap buns weird ketchup served barely warm ( nuked ? ) greasy onion wings friendly staff
best in the town if you ask me . if you love italian food come here it 's great but it does get packed cause this place is really nice .
this place is great . i 've tried everything from a chessy hotdog to their shrimp basket and it 's all delicious !
the selections are great .
but watch out for the prices , drinks can get expensive if you 're not paying attention .
- eggplant and tofu : good fresh eggplant - so tasty .
i love the cinnamon and enjoy it with the lamb .
another note is the tiny awkward bathroom .
very expensive for what we got and we do n't drink . i 'd make it $ $ $
like that there 's 3 stories , something for everyone , dining , piano bar , cigar lounge . food was good , had a tasty little strawberry shortcake drink .
this place is fantastic .
if this were a $ 30 meal for two i would 've been impressed but for $ 200 , money would be better spent elsewhere .
they have only a few beers on tap , a pretty good choice of bottled beer and a basic bar stock .
the restaurant lighting is also kind of funny , it 's not dark or light ... just something in the middle which gave you a weird feeling .
sadly , i was .
sound just bounces off the hard walls and makes it very difficult to have a conversation .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
my family had some of the more involved dishes , like the soft-boiled eggs with truffle tapenade and mushrooms , which was tasty .
i said i would hate to go elsewhere and she responded you are welcome to go elsewhere .
i will likely become a regular !
ambiance - a bit sad given the fluorescent lighting and location but i suppose you ca n't do much about it ¯\_ ( ツ ) _/¯
food was excellent and the restaurant has a nice cozy feel . does n't feel like a whole hustle and bustle authentic restaurant and sticks to it 's style .
the calamari was tender and crispy , the sauce a perfect complement .
as far as drinks , i had a watermelon mojito which was decent and refreshing .
there are plenty of flavors to choose from as far as yogurt .
not sure if i would return .
everything was so delicious and cooked to perfection . we shared the meal and it was portioned perfectly to do so where we were both satisfied and full .
i had a martini and it was great .
only downsides were the fruit was not that sweet and the crab legs were just nasty .
when i finally was released by the baggage king , we headed to our rooms to `` accept '' our bags that they would n't allow us to take by ourselves .
tacos and beer at a super reasonable price .
i also liked the layout of the place and the dark color scheme .
select food for 6 $ , house margarita for 4. delicious food , and strong drinks . yum : )
every dish was spot on ... also the speed of the service and the freshness of the food was excellent .
a complete and total rip off even begin to describe how high the prices are at this joint !
the ham and cheese croquettes are delicious .
love the spicy watermelon drink ! their strawberry milk is so delicious and fresh .
we ordered the eggplant dinner and the chicken breast dinner . they came with rice , bread and a fresh salad as sides .
cool decor and ambiance .
meatballs were full of filler . tomato sauce was bland .
the only 2 beers available was budlight and `` house special beer '' which tasted like piss water .
ambiance kind of sucks .
somewhat full bar not just beer and wine they do have liquor as well .
we chose our kryptonite and it was a pitcher of margaritas on special .
beer and wine was unlimited , but they were serving only one type of beer .
tequila selection was pretty good but the bartenders were clearly hired for other credentials than tequila knowledge , if you catch my drift .
puke under tables , women 's bathroom horrible , smell , glasses in sink ... .
they have a saki flight to get you started , but his knowledge of saki , along with the food pairings , is pretty amazing .
normally , i would never complain about it , however , when i simply asked about it , the waitress became rude and told me that the computer automatically did it as if it knew we were a party of 6 !
the coolest part about the entire restaurant was the decor and i do not mean the bathroom !
one time , i remember , ordering a glass of wine and not caring for it . i brought this to my server 's attention right away , and without hesitation , he offered to take the glass off my bill , and allow me to try something else instead - just the response i was hoping for .
it 's sort of a bizarre set up .
prices are reasonable as well .
hurts me to do this - i 'm sure it was just a fluke but today my fried chicken was legitimately burnt and the wrap to my taco was beyond stale , it was so hard it would n't fold . really disappointing lunch experience .
when i walked in , despite there being only one other customer and three employees behind the counter , no one ever helped me . i even waived at one , and he just looked at me and then turned around .
we did n't try any cocktails , but the beer selection was n't too bad .
they have two tv 's , really nice seating .
it was really good quantity for the price we paid .
beer was cold but all the mixed drinks had almost no alcohol .
and at cheap prices !
i do n't even care about the bright lighting or off decor ( or there lack of ) .
very friendly and kind .
that would make me super happy !
we waited one hour to get our food and there were only 4 couples in the restaurant .
great service . good wine .
the one thing i missed in the beer list was an indication of how many ounces they pour for the different beers .
best of all , the prices were pretty cheap .
enjoyed wonderful sunday lunch with family . quick seating and service .
this happened almost every time we exited ! made for a very poor , frustrating experience .
food was very good for what we paid , $ 37 for 5 people .
shady to me , also the service if you do n't tip is offensive !
both were delicious , piping hot with melted cheese , and fresh bread that was crisp on the outside and soft and doughy on the inside .
margarita tasted good , but was a little weak , i stuck to beer after having one .
had the bbq chicken pizza which was delicious .
i am more of a beer drinker than liquor drinker , and while there were only a few beers on tap , it was a good variety .
also , not impressed by being ushered out of our table so quickly after spending $ 100 on a meal .
huh ? bartenders were ok ... though real slow getting me another beer .
good food but prices a bit high . great staff .
glad they 're open close to me now .
very reasonably priced , as well !
not bad for $ 5 !
it 's totally faded .
no complaints on not having a full glass of beer .
great food love the sangria ! happy hour before 6pm is always great since the majority of tapas that i order is on the happy hour menu plus the sangria .
service was amazing , never had an empty water glass on the table .
for drinks we ordered a mango margarita and a cadillac margarita ( recommended ) both were refreshing .
you kind of get the feeling you are hanging out on a friend 's deck .
not a fan of the color scheme or the lighting -- it just does n't give me that warm , fuzzy feeling i like in a neighborhood joint .
this place from a 1-10 is about a 8. great price approx $ 40 for 2 people .
the only thing that was bad at this location was the service .
the atmosphere is cool and relaxing for a great lunch or night out !
this place is ridiculous with the pricing .
dude , it 's not clean .
ordered combo 2 which comes with 3 skewers ( koobideh , beef tenderloin and chicken thighs ) and 2 sides . the basmati rice was plentiful , fluffy and light .
the interior set up seemed silly , intentionally wasting space .
had a very good wine selection .
not crazy about the overhead lighting - even though they 've gelled it in pretty colors , it still feels harsh .
had nachos which were surprisingly meh . bar tap choice was kind of limited , and they did n't have all on tap .
walking in and seeing different colored lights , a screen with images that changed such as faces and lips and white sheer drapes hanging , made it sexy and pretty .
the decor looks simple but pretty , nothing is really rough on the eyes .
really good for the meat eater . i loved the salsas especially .
everything here is priced very reasonably too .
sorry , but the kids did n't each eat $ 8.95 worth of dessert .
the average breakfast tab will be $ 60 so for that price the service should be amazing . food and view are excellent , service quite bad .
but the orange chicken was only meh . the chicken pieces were fatty and chewy .
all the dishes are reasonably priced and decently sized .
for drinks i tried the cocktail with sake , it was delicious and fresh .
duck wings were delicious , rich dark meat with a delicious spicy sauce .
the only positive was that the tea that they served was iced steeped tea which was refreshing on such a hot day .
hey it was only $ 5 .
this place is awesome - cool location and history , and really unique and delicious food .
the decor was miserable and gaudy .
there is nothing special about it to justify the higher price .
you ca n't miss the bellagio fountains ! it 's such a cool quick show with great music .
constructive now - i think the bathrooms could need some attention , floor not very nice and hole in the wall in the men 's bathroom .
the portions were fair but far from huge .
braised beef noodle soup is amazing ! broth is tasty and full of flavour , tons of noodles and beef is good .
food was mediocre and came out all cold and had to send a dish back to even melt the cheese . another friend had a hair in his meal .
but the 1 free sauce they give you is tiny , and its a dollar more for each additional sauce or 3 for 2.50. add in a 5 dollar shake and my meal came out to like 18 dollars .
loved the wine on tap .
i think the bartender may only be good at pouring beer .
the restaurant was dirty and the service was incredibly slow .
for $ 2.50 , it 's great value .
they have a special right now for large one topping for $ 7.95 carry out only .
unfortunately , i do n't drink beer .
the service was terrible .
to begin with the tables , booths , fake plants and sagging ceiling tiles are any combination of worn out , dirty or sticky .
placed an order for wife but i do n't think their customer service is that great . lady was n't that friendly .
the only knock is that there was no beer on tap ; bottle selection was good though .
my only ding is that they never seem to have enough checkout lanes open ... usually a 10 minute minimum wait any time of day .
then we had to wait some more while she went and checked with the manager again . finally he came over and did the credit .
our server kept apologizing and he was attentive with a great personality but that could n't make up for what was a completely unsatisfying dinner .
how hard is it to just cook a different steak and add $ 5 dollars ?
mediocre at best ... i ordered the california benedict and both of my poached eggs had solid yolks : ( they were busy , but service was slow and the waitress was bland . my father ordered the chicken fried steak ( which was better than my benedict , but still left much to be desired ) .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
the service was also great , two waiters tag teamed the table and we did n't want for anything .
just nothing special , and higher prices not justified in my opinion .
you will not be disappointed .
but dust , tacky wall art and poorly patched booth seats just ruin the ambiance .
it was great , but probably not surprisingly it was incredibly salty .
orange beef was very dry and was n't fresh at all . kids meal sweet and sour chicken was tasteless .
i ordered a glass of sparkling wine which was very light and delicious .
overall , we had a wonderful time and everyone was pleased with the food and service .
i noticed tequila behind the bar but did n't see any beer and am unaware of what the happy hour entails .
bathroom is a decent size ... .the full length mirror in the bathroom is really nice , but they do n't have any other mirrors in the room other than the two in the bathroom ... ..which was weird ... .
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
the decoration and interior really suck unfortunately .
ok so the location of the hotel is great . rooms are big a spacious and their gym is perfect .
we both started our with their patented pressed turkey sandwiches , which come with a small side salad . both the sandwiches and side salads were fantastic .
amazing place to be when the weather is nice . the terrace is the best place on campus to share a beer with some friends and just relax and enjoy the rare warm weather in madison .
i was craving for chicken i decided to give this place a try .
it was ok. not very flavorful - bland .
the waiter froze and only waved for help after everyone failed to get it clear of the table .
this particular location , however , has always impressed me with their service .
margarita tasted good , but was a little weak , i stuck to beer after having one .
this place is very small but has a well thought out layout .
the fries were perfectly cooked , crispy wonderfulness . the house made ketchup was a perfect , zingy accompaniment .
very nice . very clean .
total with tip and tax about $ 43 a piece ... which is excellent for a wynn restaurant .
cornbread is also yummy , not too sweet . pull prom and chicken are my favorite meats .
nice selection of pizzas and pastas and grilled selection .
beers were ok , but they were bottled beers , so it would be pretty difficult for them to ruin that .
: ) the view , though , is very unique and adds to a fine dining experience .
everything was delicious however , the quesadillas did not taste like there was any cheese in it .
not bad and they had a great selection of beers on tap and mixed drinks and wine .
this place is awesome .
had great experiences with the fish and chips and bacon cheeseburger with jalapeños .
awesome . this italian joint has an awesome atmosphere with the brick walls , open kitchen , and dim lighting .
but there 's not a whole lot of substance to hold up all that pretentious vibe .
the food would have been a rip off for $ 10 but the actual cost was absurd and insulting . i felt duped .
server never came by to ask if we were good on drinks or anything .
so glad to find a good dimsum in vegas .
great job , thanks for a wonderful evening .
food is priced reasonably and tasted good .
corn bread was fantastic , chicken was crisp and juicy , waffle was amazing . get the mac and cheese .
excellent . we had a nice bottle of wine and split salads and sides between the group .
i found the decor slick and appealing , has kind of a velvet rope appeal without being too clubby feeling .
at first , we were not sure if they still accept people in as we waited for a while before anyone came to greed us .
first of all , they only have beer and wine , no liquor .
this is a pretty solid spot for lunch and for happy hour . the prices otherwise are a little high and their sushi isnt that good .
good service . could relax and enjoy my meal .
the restaurant itself is kind of ... dingy .
my sons grilled cheese was well done and almost burned . the mac and cheese ... dry noodles .
prices are pretty high as each crepe ran about $ 9-12 each .
the drinks were amazing as well . they have quite the drink selection .
ordering feels a little awkward at first , due to its cafeteria-like style .
however , the price was quite reasonable so maybe you get what you pay for .
the batter was crispy and light , and the accompanying tartar sauce had a hint of jalapeño that was a welcome surprise .
i will definitely come back , starting with the happy hour : )
it tasted horrible anyway .
beer selection was good , but a gastropub should have unique vessels for drinks . cider in a guinness pint glass is just ... .wrong .
the only negative was the tables .
drunken noodles with shrimp were very good , as well .
good food . bit pricey but not overpriced value for what you get .
reliable menu , nothing too fancy or expensive , entrees average $ 25 .
not impressed at all . expensive and the chocolate cheesecake we got tasted like it was defrosted and then sat in a fridge for a week , which i 'm sure is exactly what happened .
all that for only $ 8.50 .
the lighting was a little bright but maybe that 's just me .
there 's only one reason to be here , and that 's the patio .
the beer glasses were n't even frothy , and the beers on tap that arrived were n't even cold .
the vietnamese donkey which is a beefed up version of a moscow mule was extremely refreshing the strong ginger taste is welcoming and the drink is just well executed .
we found out why . server was only by once after food was delivered .
definitely would recommend the variety of teas they have i got the pomegranate mojito tea that they had ready and it s perfect for this hot day .
it ai n't cheap but it is good as hell .
the $ 5 cocktails were so refreshing .
no too sure why i did n't like this place .
excellent customer service . clean place .
we had two different kinds of chicken .
we each enjoyed a glass of wine .
the beer i got ( which was the cheapest on tap besides miller lite ) was not bad .
grilled buffalo chicken sandwich pretty dry too but waitress was nowhere around to tell .
the garlic spinach and the sauteed mushrooms were great compliments to the steak . service was excellent .
total dinner bill for a 5 topping , 10 '' pizza with a beer came to under $ 12 !
great place to have a singing hangout !
omelet one of the flakiest ever . homemade biscuits unbelievable .
it 's great for lunch , dinner and late night .
my friends and i always talked about trying it out and we finally got around to it this past weekend .
service was very attentive and pleasant and upbeat .
i kind of enjoy how tacky the taste in decoration is .
the beer list was disappointing .
perfect hole in the wall eatery . prices are cheap , great service , and very good sandwiches .
the fish was nice and crispy however it was literally as though they took the fish without cleaning it and just fried it .
great menu , fair prices .
the bathroom is n't necessarily dirty , but it is very rundown .
our waiter was hilarious and did n't mind we changed our opinion on how we wanted our steak down 3 times .
that being said , i am not qualified to rate their food against other establishments but i have absolutely no complaints .
first , the drink menu . i was surprised to see so many original , signature cocktails and non-alcoholic choices .
the beer menu was pretty weak . they did n't have much on tap and the bottle selection was just as poor .
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
the price is higher than average so i expected great food .
unfortunately he was disappointed because the beer taps were frozen and they could n't pour and beers !
the prices here are very fair and reasonable .
no music playing , no one talking , somewhat uncomfortable feeling .
went here yesterday with the family to celebrate a birthday and it was amazing .
the daiquiri is really delicious and hand-crafted ; you wo n't be getting a sweet slushy here .
the general manager lynn is very friendly as well , ask for dean when coming here .
i was pretty excited to try them , so decided to order delivery with doordash . after almost 2 hours of wait and no for or updates from the restaurant i contacted doordash 's support only to find out that the restaurant did n't make the order because they were out of sausages .
it 's located right in the heart of mill avenue , but just off the street .
service was horrible , i did n't know my order was called and when i asked if it was ready the one cook slammed my to go bag on the counter and yelled at me for not getting it when he called it . burger was not that great , fries were good
great food and service . we tried the happy hour drinks and they were smooth with a great price .
ridiculous because i drink a lot during my meal and our waitress did n't even ask if i wanted a refill .
it came soaked in cheap , and unpleasant sauce that came straight from a bottle .
ordered a beer in the bottle as they only had the typical `` crap '' in my opinion on draft .
the food itself was just ok , it was often lukewarm or cold .
this place was absolutely horrible !
i 'm always excited to go here !
for a quick bite this place is great .
no margaritas . just beer and wine : -/ what 's a girl to do .
i really enjoy eating outside there on a nice evening .
quality food that was fast and cheap .
sandwich was fine but i guess the ingredients just were n't at the peak of freshness because it just seemed bland .
it was like swallowing a spoonful of straight apple cider vinegar - not pleasant at all .
the lo mein noodles really did n't differ from panda express except that it had some veggies here and there and dumped a cup of sugar in it , and for $ 9 with bland `` crispy '' yet dry chicken i will say that it was another disappointment .
waiter slow , forgetful and hard to understand ... and he forgot to get raw sugar , forgot to get ketchup and hot sauce , forgot to refill coffee , got one of two orders completely wrong , argued that the toast was toasted ( it was n't ) .
prices are pretty reasonable .
it 's cheap . it 's fast .
the food is good and prices are reasonable .
the staff is fun , friendly , and attentive .
i ordered the napoleon and i could have made a better crepe myself - and i 'm not even a good cook ! it was made with frozen berries that tasted like rubber .
also , a random unnecessary thing to note : the girls washroom has a very fancy sink , the guys do not .
our waitress , victoria , was great , pairing a perfect bottle of wine with our meals .
the drinks : great selection of flavored sake .
i was in love with the atrium setting and thought it was beautiful !
my mom than proceeded to ask her if they offer a happy hour , she stated that they did and referred to the card sitting on the table and said its either the happy hour price or the 50 % off .
not total hipster but it was just a weird setting .
a manager was brought in on the situation who as well was very rude .
our server , amanda was pretty awesome , too .
the hot dogs were served on buttered , new england style rolls .
great service , nice wine list selections .
i love the outdoor seating on a pretty day and also love sitting at the bar if it is a bit more crowded . there is always space to lay my work out which is nice !
we started with a fruit and beignet plate and a bottle of rose .
i got a glass of some other kind of beer in a nasty glass .
they charge $ 7 for a 16 ounce noda beer which is too high .
beet part is they only cost $ 4 !
my girlfriend ordered the 3 item combo but that did n't look very good .
mcdonalds probably do n't get that many reviews because they do n't have much high expectations . but this mcdonalds stood out to me .
my favorite is the spicy cajun vegan fish , house chow fun , spicy tuna sushi roll & the rainbow sushi roll .
we ordered a house wine and a draft beer , nothing complicated .
that does n't even come close to an accurate description .
it was barely warm .
very beautiful architecture , awesome ambiance and the food/drinks are top notch . grab a bloody , pizza and enjoy one cool restaurant .
excellent wine choices and service .
i really liked it . the texture was really fine , pretty much like snow .
not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses , that were more like scotch glasses , only knock .
cool little place , happy , courteous group of men and women who work here .
since i love pizza and am willing to try different types , i asked my server shawn for his recommendation .
it 's a small place , but quiet and comfortable .
it was pretty good , but could 've used a bit more meat on it .
the prices are super as well .
the crepe itself was a little more on the doughy , chewy side , but the flavour was still great .
they have a lot of drink options and the cocktails are delicious .
the beers were ok , nothing special .
it was replaced with another draft beer that was n't that great either .
the decor is nice but i wish it was a bit more bright .
food options are plentiful and for the most part of good quality .
the salad was sooooo unique and delicious .
the food is great and very reasonable priced .
cool area , too many tourists .
decor is pleasant . place looks clean .
the beer list was disappointing .
unfortunately , it was super salty .
the more expensive , 8 ounces for 9 bucks is better cuts .
the price is quite reasonable though .
the thai corn chowder is awesome -so flavorful .
drinks : i ordered an angry orchard cider on tap and my wife had one of their signature mixed drinks that came in just a normal size hurricane glass .
the broth at yoshi bento tasted like fish although it was a chicken dish , maybe they use a miso soup base .
prices are very reasonable .
i hate the fact that the menu is written all over the walls ( including wine ) difficult to read since it is very dim .
cool ambience . good for a drink .
i could drink the mint tea everyday .
everyone had a really good time .
great food at very decent prices .
the restaurant itself is beautiful , very clean and well designed .
the restroom was pretty nasty , urine on the toilet seat , on the floor , trash filled up , trash on the floor , and only one restroom for one customer .
very friendly staff too !
our check was still $ 40 , which is fine . but i guess the $ 7 is important to someone .
it was filling with a. ice cold glass of passion tea the way it is without sugar .
no flavor to the spring rolls , pad thai was gummy and tasteless . no alcohol .
only reason i give this a 4 star is because of price . prices are high but i guess that 's expected for a restaurant on the strip .
you 'd like a margarita ? you 'd like a happy hour margarita ?
i have tasted the chicken one . i like the meat and the rice coming with it .
the decor is really classy and pretty with plenty of chandeliers in the lobby .
the cost was decent , $ 22.99 and add another $ 2.50 for the bottomless champagne , although cheap champagne it was still a cool deal .
the tempura shrimp was pretty good and a large portion but other than that the meal was 2 star at best before the aforementioned possible food poisoning .
love the festive environment and patio !
she rolled her eyes at me , gave a loud , obnoxious sigh , and changed my drinks to a large .
i honestly do n't know why i expected more from this place , i loved the interior design and lighting but the food did not satisfy me at all .
the soup was fantastic !
unfortunately it seems they only get your order right half the time , which is a bummer .
the risotto was the only miss , bland with a gluey texture .
it is not cheap but reasonable for what you get .
new faces come and go , this visit today was ok. cashier was friendly and attentive , that is about as far a it went besides good food .
i am a huge fan of the hot cookies though .
the wine is great ( i recommend the paul pour cabernet on tap ) , crab cakes shareable and wow the entree .
it had just enough flavor to be edible . not a satisfying meal whatsoever .
would have potentially given it a 5 , but my soup was n't hot ( temperature ) .
onion rings which seemed pretty ok pulled pork on kaiser roll which was sweet sauced but not overly heavy which allowed the taste of the pork to shine through .
and the service is great in this place .
the music they play is good . the atmosphere is good .
highly recommend trying it out .
i 'm very happy we found this place !
it 's creepy and weird .
the staff even had an opportunity to make it better , but were completely unapologetic and showed no sense of empathy or professionalism to the matter ; and so pizza lovers and possible lifetime patrons have been lost .
come here and relax with the other creepy dudes !
favorite mexican food place . great prices and food .
very reasonably priced as well .
topped off with grapefruit juice ( fresh ) and a s'more mocha . everything was fantastic .
this is my favorite restaurant in all of scottsdale .
they barely had any beers on tap , had no jack daniels , but did make a pretty good moscow mule .
the food was excellent ( spicy miso and the dumplings ) . service was great .
the menu is pretty diverse from your classic eggs , meat and potatoes , to steel cut oatmeal and plenty of varieties of eggs benedict dishes !
as far as drinks go , the tropical martini , georgia peach , & prickly pear margarita are a few of my favorites .
but the view is incredible .
all in all it was good , not too salty , the way i like it .
the beers we ok nothing special .
we were beyond thrilled . the service was friendly and efficient and the meal was fabulous !
unfortunately , i was disappointed .
the service was on point . attentive yet not overbearing .
the pool area is pretty amazing and i could just imagine what it would look like when they have a music concert here .
it was super cheap .
we spent about $ 40 per person including beer and cocktails , which i felt was an excellent value .
they had some great drinks on draft that tasted like beer .
the beer list is pretty good and very reasonably priced .
we had a really nice dinner here the other day .
while a dark restaurant may signify expensive , they just do n't do `` dark '' right .
i could only eat the tender side , which was n't really tender , because the rest of it was so overcooked i could n't cut into it .
prices are decent and happy hour prices are even better .
weird lighting , weird colors and no meat to be found .
also a great wine list !
our server was lovely and very attentive , and when i asked about the prawns pakora , she said they had them despite the fact that it was nowhere to be found on the menu .
vienna beef stands out as having thinly sliced , soft and tender pieces of meat that are cooked in a signature jous that give them amazing flavor .
i then tried the blackberry mule special they had that night , and that was unique and delicious as well .
the bar and drinks looked like a decent selection but did n't drink that night .
so dive in . the music is good and in the summer when the window door is open , lots of air to keep cool .
but not in a stuffy or silly way .
i was fully aware of what a foie gras was but i still did n't understand why you would insist on me consuming a $ 30 burger in your dining room with your loud tv blaring and the bright fluorescent lights .
i would recommend this place for a lazy week night dinner .
however , even she says that it will be her one and only visit .
the price was super reasonable !
only 5 oz not 6. also rather expensive all the way around .
service is good , prices are reasonable .
not sure rolls are even worth the $ 4 paid at happy hour .
one of my party at dinner told me that she had seen the managers talking to our waiter and suspected that this was part of the reason that we were treated in a manner that was far below our expectations and what we previously experienced .
i do not order tap beer there , the selection is very weak anyway .
i can imagine enjoying any meal there , as it was like sitting in someone 's cozy kitchen .
atmosphere and booth are the only positives here this evening .
our two items came out to $ 13 , which is pretty pricey .
the bartender , dont know her name but she looked to be about 30 was increased rude .
there is so much attention to details that the interior design is 5 stars on its own .
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
i have also tried my fair share of different dishes on their menu and have never been disappointed .
i love tessaro 's because like most pittsburghers , i appreciate when an establishment keeps its traditions .
only stayed for about 5 minutes which was long enough to look around .
they 're probably paying high rent for century iii but other than that it 's a great place !
liked that they had a selection of juices with ginger and peach infused water based products .
when it shows up only a little warm or tepid , it means a ) the soup was n't hot enough when you placed in the meat or b ) frozen meat was dropped in my hot soup .
doubt we 'd eat there again unless it was the only place around .
i noticed pretty much right when we sat down that the service was not going to be good .
not muddled properly , and it tasted like gin not rum ... .let 's try the nachos ... .hmmm canned guac , canned jalapeño , and add chicken that is cold and cut up from the night before . at least the spotted beer glasses are cold ... .
the person was n't annoying just the theme park feel of that .
their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers .
first of all , i have paid $ 50 per person for 6 people and never had such an awful buffet for this price .
the good news - the decor and the layout are quite nice .
the sandwiches were nice & scones were fresh .
both amazing . the workers are very friendly .
it was reasonably priced .
i think the interior is ugly .
the walls in the rooms seemed paper thin , the room itself felt dark and uninviting , and the resort itself is just so massive and lacking a flow pattern that it feels stale .
cheers folks , great place .
personally , i must say they are great because they are at a convenient location .
great food ! always busy at lunch .
the wine / sake list is very good .
if you are looking for fine dining with a great view - this place has it !
our waitstaff were super friendly .
your better off spending your 12 bucks in a fast food joint .
we had delicious drinks for happy hour and it was really well priced .
the meal was expensive and not sure if worth the money
drinks including the house wine and coffee or excellent .
for $ 15 , i expect a really good burger .
while presentation was unique , it was nothing special and quite pricy for what you get at $ 17 .
their price is pretty fair and the staff friendly .
food ; scrumptious , especially those crispy sweet potato fries .
i guess it 's just the premium you pay for great food .
the decor does n't completely mesh , but somehow it 's still cozy .
but again , the meat lacked any seasoning ( even salt and pepper ) never mind any kind of braising or marinating .
everything was delicious . maya helped us out with her knowledge and expertise and we were very happy with our choices .
disappointing all around . beer was ho-hum .
the food was fresh , had nice presentation and the taste was flavorful .
great place with a wide variety of options .
$ 18 for 3 flavorless tacos is ridiculous , even for the strip .
there are no decorations on the bland walls .
paintings ) are weird , but i guess they 'd be good ice breakers or conversation starters .
the service was attentive , and each course was great starting with the bread . we had lamb meatballs , parmesan and mushroom gnocchi , and the hanger steak .
the price was pretty cheap compared to the strip buffets but i guess you get what you paid for .
they do have beautiful interior , including merry go around set , an old telephone booth and stained glass lights .
the only reason why this place does n't get 5 stars is due to the fact that the lighting was very dark for my ambiance flavor .
prices are reasonable as well .
even got a free wine sample !
a great selection of dishes .
with the two sandwiches and drinks i believe the total was around 15-17 dollars .
they do have a full bar but no beer on tap .
we ordered cocktails - i ordered the passionfruit margarita which was good .
however the beer was cold , and they had smithwick 's on tap .
even the bread basket is awesome - chili asiago cheese , walnut raisin , blue cornbread ... yummy .
i also had nigori sake ( not sure of the brand ) that was delicious .
the staff was very attentive , clearly motivated to do a good job with the new restaurant and it is a bright and cheerful place , fun to visit .
good portions and quite flavorful .
hate over-cooked scallops but soho always cooks it to melt-in-your-mouth perfection .
i loved it . a few shots of jameson , a good beer and nice service .
my dad and i sat in the bar area while we waited to be seated and had a martini and a gin and tonic , both of which were made strong and poured at our table .
highly recommend this restaurant !
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
the restaurant is a really beautiful space -- moody overhead lighting , cool art on the walls , and unique furniture spread around for a loungy kind of feel .
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
the employees were very friendly and accommodating .
not only was i in attendance for bad behavior on management 's part , but also able to read an atrocious letter written to a friend simply because she wrote a bad review .
the salsas are amazing as well .
i highly recommend the south beach peach drink if you are into fruity cocktails .
while the dipping sauce was fine , the chicken itself had no flavor . the fries were toothpick thin and had no discernable potato flavor .
i loved their soft bun and the mix of sweet and savory with the hot dog , pineapples , simon sauce , mozzarella cheese , jalapeños and crushed chips .
service was friendly and efficient , very casual and comfortable , what more can you need , we came three times during our visit , as they have a variety of items we wanted to try , and we were never let down . great atmosphere , happy staff , ca n't wait to come back on our next trip !
when the dish did finally arrive , it was an astonishingly small portion for the $ 35 and the meat lacked flavour .
no good beers on tap or bottle , so i ordered water .
the ordering style was weird .
this place was great !
the restaurant layout was totally weird but who really cares .
i love the patio seating too .
given the portions it is reasonably priced .
we tried places near by featured on a popular food network show and was not impressed.. but copper kettle is a great relaxing neighborhood spot !
the ambience was quiet and trendy .
the food was good but they only filled the rice containers half way , so for the price i expected to have the rice container full . there was n't enough rice for the amount of sauce .
my one complaint was that the men 's bathroom was shockingly dirty and in serious need of repair .
i love this place !
it would cost 10 bucks for a good healthier meal at mcdonald 's compared to this place instead of 35 for cheap food .
carmon 's is a dingy little restaurant that has cute `` authentic '' touches here and there - fans that look like jet engines , mismatched salt and pepper sets , crappy paper menus shoved onto a clipboard , an antique cash register - but their menu lacks a certain something .
while the price is right here , i 'd rather spend my time and money in a place with better ambiance and better food for a dollar more .
the interior was nice but felt like a knock off , with paint chipped off some of the styrofoam ball ornaments .
wine list is fabulous too .
everything is a la carte , so our total came $ 75 which to me is a lot more expensive than your regular sushi .
all we had were drinks but they were tasty and on a great happy hour : 2-5pm and 9-close .
the prices are very reasonable too .
the floor was wet and dirty , and no tp or paper towels in the women 's room .
whitney have is great , fast and friendly service .
great local spot for drinks and food . nice outdoor area with couches and fireplaces .
st germain is an elderflower liqueur i had never tried before and combined w/ the bourbon , ginger beer , orange , cherries and sprinkle of cinnamon ... wow !
price is about 10 $ for entree and a couple more for a drink . 20 $ for a great meal .
definitely recommend making a reservation and going here ! service and food was amazing !
service is always fast and friendly .
decent prices and good lunch specials .
their cocktail menu has some interesting drinks on there , after some consideration and the helpful guidance of the bartender i settled on cocktail # 5. the blend of vodka with citrus and jalapeño was refreshing and delicious .
very odd . i ordered a specialty drink not on the menu and it came out wonderfully ; everyone was very happy with their drinks .
i 'll most likely be back lol n
love the atmosphere and the fact that they have tv 's so you can watch sports and have a great burger !
the bread was crunchy & soft and the chicken was smothered in cheese and topped with sprouts . very good !
i 'm not an expert on interior design or anything like that , but it just did n't feel comfortable in there .
i had the mediterranean diet salad with tofu . excellent choice .
very cheap and good .
they have a decent draft beer selection , and even more in bottles .
that would explain why nobody was attentive and every single time i needed something , i had to go running around the restaurant to find a server .
super great find in tempe !
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
service was excellent and the staff was very accommodating even though we stayed well past close .
that saved your business a grand total of $ 2.50 and costed you a potential returning customer .
the cheese bread -- omg -- the cheese was a mixture of mozzarella , parmesan and feta - amazing !
this location lacks the character of the original location but it 's a nice option for north scottsdale dining ! although it 's located in a strip mall on the freeway , once you step inside , it feels like a family-friendly restaurant with a little bit of mexican flare .
both the specialty drinks and food menu for happy hour have something for everone .
great food , excellent selection of wine and beer .
i also had to have one of their fresh juices , it had kale , celery , beet etc and was a great .
the fellow reviews of the waitress 's hold true , they are very friendly and attentive .
the price was approximately $ 40 per person for lunch , which is n't too bad given all the seafood and meat .
the food is reasonably priced too .
you may even feel unsafe because of the poor lighting and somewhat dingy appearance .
i recommend ordering the mango daiquiri it 's extremely smooth and delicious .
super impressed by this place !
the only downside is the price for the burgers ... it was pretty pricey for a burger around $ 14 for it .
but once i opened the box at home , found a 9.5 '' ( cut into 8 slices , like the 12 '' was supposed to be ) and zero bbq grilled chicken .
i paid $ 10 for a pizza that is plenty for one and enough as a light dinner for two - a reasonable price .
the wine is , of course , delicious .
not cheap , you are not getting out of here for under $ 12 for a complete meal at lunch .
their beers are pricey but they usually have decent drinks specials which makes it more reasonable .
the food was awesome as usual the buffalo cheese dip was probably all of our favorite .
it 's a nice , quiet , cozy italian restaurant .
prices were reasonable too .
they make some great drinks and are great at keeping the drinks full .
great place for drinks .
even one of the draft beers was bad !
as a paying , repeating customer i find that to be annoying and disconcerting when i 'm not being heard .
falafel are made fresh to order and they are super tasty .
my server was so helpful and nice . the food was so good and the drink menu was fantastic .
first off , the entrance is kind of awkward .
the draft beer was totally flat . pretty awful .
this is a completely ridiculous rule that has now caused them to lose a customer forever .
both said the meat was tough and it was not heated up enough .
both were awesome ... but i think the shrimp was the victor .
today , i 'm enjoying an eggwhite omelet with scallions and feta and sundried tomatoes . it 's delicious .
happy hour here is pretty darn good because the prices become more affordable .
the decor is a little outdated but i forgive them .
the food here is excellent . they also have a unique dish which includes the ingredients from the pho soup into sandwich with crusty bread that you dip in the pho broth .
great food and cheap prices .
i had chicken marsala & the chicken was so tender & was served with garlic mashed potatoes & veggies .
they do n't have a special that combines the two , so we ordered a 16 inch supreme pizza for $ 18.00 , that was on special .
the beer , wine and cocktail list looks amazing .
tasty food at good prices .
beer was awful and is n't even in a pint glass .
i love the non-alcoholic sangria .
we both tried the green chili posole special , and loved the presentation and flavors .
i loved the atmosphere , seeing the servers perform was fun and the dj played great music . the projector on the wall worth the sake rok stuff and music videos was a nice added touch .
overall , it is very good pizza and the sandwiches are great
the selection of draft beers looked o.k . nothing outstanding but their bottle selection sucked .
no stars for that beef , the only saving grace was it did n't make me too sick , i expected to be sick for days not just one day !
food : ok this is why the review gets 3 stars , as the food was just ok. we ordered the calamari ( which came soggy and not light and crispy as it should ) .
the food was awful , overcooked , and lacked any sort of good flavor .
only downer is that at pam real thai the bill would 've been $ 30 and here it was $ 50
it is no loud i do n't think there is any insulation in the walls . the room is dirty i know they did n't clean the mirror has stuff all over it .
the only issue is night we went , most of the 300ml sake bottles were sold out .
it feels kind of creepy .
absolutely delicious steak and chicken tacos . they 're ginormous , loaded with meat and cheese and made with soft , warm corn or flour tortillas .
for the food and drink combined , comes out to about 12 $ per person , which is reasonable .
the room was very clean and modern , loved the fact there was a lot of mirrors !
face it if you can get out under 150 ( tip included ) for dinner , desert , and a drink each for 2 on the strip at a good restaurant consider that a bargain .
these servers looked dumpy and just bizarre styling !
place is really kept clean and looking good . staff very friendly and fast !
food - had the house merlot it was wonderful . had the calamari flakey and tender .
did not feel a good vibe from the moment i stepped in .
the beer list was disappointing .
all very good . a decent wine list as well rounds out the experience .
everything i have had from this place is great , the chicken pita , tuna salad , and the chicken salad .
everything was light and fresh .
craft beers were about 5-6 which is n't too bad .
so fast and easy .
loved the country music , atmosphere and great service .
the prices are very reasonable for the area .
i like the happy hour specials q has though , i think we paid $ 15/hr for the smallest room due to happy hour pricing .
they used dark meat chicken , found a done in the dish .
the only improvement i would have liked is if the music in the restaurant was a bit quieter , since my friend and i found it difficult to speak to and hear each other during our meal .
sure its way overpriced .
weekday lunch was `` meh '' . nothing special ... i like the buffet at bellagio much better .
that is a huge no , no in the food industry and a turn off for me when eating any food that should be at least moderately hot .
top it off with a nice bottle of asahi the worlds best lager !
they bring out a baguette with some marinara sauce to dip it in and it was nice and hot , fresh out of the oven .
ordered a glass of sake , liked it and decided to order the bottle .
the lighting is horrible ; could not read the menu .
i saw some liquor bottles but did n't focus long enough to say whether they have a decent selection of tequila or not .
lovely ambiance as well .
everything is good , but not excellent . prices are shockingly low .
lastly , the chicken balls are awesome here .
just a heads up they do n't have liquor , only wine and beer .
the restaurant is pretty bright and spacious .
you will not be disappointed .
i love this place and eat here all the time .
they enjoyed themselves because of the company but indifferent about the food .
nice place for lunch or dinner and prices are very reasonable .
if we wanted to go to a normal dining we would have gone somewhere else .
we also had the pasta , bacon wrapped dates and cocktails . all were delicious .
they were the most disgusting ribs i have ever had .
horrible service really ... .
this place is right inside the casino basically on the floor .
they barely had any beers on tap , had no jack daniels , but did make a pretty good moscow mule .
the place is clean , airy , with plenty for seating .
prices are very , very fair !
i did n't order any beer or cocktails , but looked like a great selection of beer .
also it was somewhat filthy , curtains , ceiling , floor and bathroom ... ... disgusting !
tea and gelato and actually tasty and creative vegan options ! i love their extensive tea menu and all the different vegan options to try .
service was attentive and fast .
cozy little breakfast cafe in situated up in the aspen area .
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
a lot of great tasting food for cheap
if everyone in your party orders an `` entree '' ( which range from $ 30- $ 45 ) , you get free admission into the club .
we ordered 5 items , waited in the drive thru for more than 10 minutes , and when we finally got our order , the cashier was rude when i asked her which blizzard was which .
this establishment only sees dollar signs and gives zero shits about anything else ( shocking , i know ) . they 're cheap , rude and insulting to anyone who ca n't throw money at them .
the chicken was delicious but i wo n't be running back based on the dining experience . it should be noted the servers were all very friendly but the staff all seemed confused and disorganized .
first of all it has a great full bar , with a huge martini list and drink specials .
it 's not that anyone was rude or mean ; it 's just that taking an order of five appetizers overwhelmed our server to the point that he acted like he had just done heroin .
super pricey , almost $ 40 for one adult and two children . dining area nothing special , lets hope the food makes the trip worthwhile
we had a groupon so we figured we 'd try a new place . everyone there was super friendly and everything was great .
it was a little dry and bland .
go for the sangria too - it 's quite tasty ! the atmosphere is nice - it 's dark and a little more cozy than other places in vegas .
the prices are reasonable and the food is good .
i really like this venue , it 's got this hip zen feel and there are smoking hot women in tubs filled with water and rose petals .
the service is always courteous and friendly .
it was a very pleasant experience from the food to the nice and friendly staff .
will be back around to possible drink 2 bottles of wine : p
their special breakfast items are a little pricier ( like ... $ 8 ) , but tasty and filling .
not muddled properly , and it tasted like gin not rum ... .let 's try the nachos ... .hmmm canned guac , canned jalapeño , and add chicken that is cold and cut up from the night before . at least the spotted beer glasses are cold ... .
only shining star was the decor .
the beer was cold , they have jameson and a tequila on draft and they serve tacos late .
could n't drink but beer menu looked awesome too .
crispy fries with their special seasoning sprinkled on top accompanied with the most addicting dipping sauce .
the patio furniture is a pleasing turquoise and dark brown color scheme , though up close it looks a bit dirty .
nothing fancy , cheery interior , decent food ... four stars .
visiting from out of town and trying this out of other yelp recommendations . delicious and fresh !
$ 19 typically , i would probably lower it to 3 stars since the prices are pretty high for the amount of food , but it is vegas and nothing in vegas is cheap .
the chili was in the texas style , spicy and without beans , and was a good starter .
very clean , great place to eat inside and outdoors and the staff is for the most part very lively .
average location , i liked the nachos . my fish tacos came out lukewarm and my salad was like something i could whip up at home .
the lighting was pretty cool , though ( check out the pictures i snapped ) .
finally some of our group walked out and complained to the manager .
especially if you pay close to $ 9 bucks for pasta and chicken , it better be near prefect .
the food selection and quality are outstanding .
he did n't charge us for the dish , but he did make us feel uncomfortable like we had intention of getting over on the place , in which we did n't .
prices are a bit on the more expensive side , but nothing i would n't expect .
- wine selection was good , and the cocktails were great !
the drinks are cheap .
then further disappointment struck when i tasted it , no fucking salt !
amazing lunch with awesome service . house made grapefruit soda was very refreshing .
really great meal and reasonably priced too .
really good food , and service kathy was super helpful with suggesting things on the menu . i would definitely recommend this restaurant .
they are not cheap , but nothing is cheap in vegas .
ok so i had the 4pc , fries , coleslaw ... . not to bad at all chicken fingers has a good taste a tender white meat , fries are lightly salted which is good because i do n't need all the salt no way , og the sweet tea taste better the mcdonald 's i must say
they basically give you a bun that is jammed with a two inch thick wad of meat .
had nachos which were surprisingly meh . bar tap choice was kind of limited , and they did n't have all on tap .
my friend and i visited charlotte and found i love juice bar on yelp and were really happy with what we both ordered . i think he ordered the berry good smoothie and subbed blueberry for mango and also ordered a wheatgrass shot .
great wine list as well .
tacos go for $ 3.50 - $ 4.50 a piece , and three filled me up .
the crust was toasty with a medium crust . the cheese was fantastic .
the 2 for $ 20 special was pretty decent .
i asked for a hefeweizen but no ; they have 30 beers on tap including 6 different ipas , but not a hefeweizen in the house .
they have only a few beers on tap , a pretty good choice of bottled beer and a basic bar stock .
would highly recommend this place .
smoked meat is so good !
another ordered the fettuccine alfredo and said it was good , but nothing special .
oh , and their specialty cocktails were excellent .
and to add insult to injury , the first employee we came in contact with after waiting 15 minutes out in the cold just to get in the door , was oblivious and just asking how long the line was and shocked to hear it was out to the taxi drop off area .
finally one of us complained , and then we all got to sit and watch the manager ask three or four waiters in a row who would take us while they argued about it .
in total it came out to about $ 32 .
the dining room is very small .
sat at the bar , ordered a cold negro modelo - they only offer it on draft .
the bulgogi itself i was n't too impressed with , but that 's alright because it did the trick .
prices were reasonable also .
it was soggy and had terrible salad dressings . even worse , the waitress just dumped the food on the table .
the venue itself is wonderfully designed , and feels intimate without feeling corny .
the bartender was pretty rad , and made a pretty delicious drink which was off-menu ( because i asked for something with tromba tequila ) .
food is great , prices are high .
get it with the jalapeño cilantro hummus and the saffron nice .
no good beers on tap or bottle , so i ordered water .
if you like thin , large slices stocked up with delicious toppings , this place is for you .
the restaurant has an absurdly tacky interior . a shame , really .
i love this place .
most of the entrees are under $ 10 , amazing value for the money .
i really liked the tofu from last time but they did n't have it today . i was hesitant to go for chicken but the cubed ones have substance than the shredded .
decent food , good value , ample portions . tomatoes and orange slices were fresh .
i then switched to beer - they have a pretty good beer list available , too .
every time i come here the staff is short and rude and unpleasant .
somehow the crust for it was a bit too crisp but the toppings were delicious !
the flavor was good , but the salad was unmixed .
pretty dark , rugged , and maybe a little dirty ?
only waited a few minutes for a table and service was good .
then the people who work under him basically hate their job too .
i started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila .
i 'm sorry bartender - last time i checked , your job is to serve , not to insult your patrons .
i ordered the elvis , because i was attracted to the bacon filled , peanut butter batter ... but i was disappointed .
both combo platters came with slaw and fries , each of which were ample and delicious .
the first glace is cute , what girl does n't like hearts and bright colors ?
yes , price is higher than most , but i 'm willing to pay for it !
only had water to drink so can not comment on the drink or beer pours .
my coworkers and i went on our company dinner together today . minh and tucker were so courteous and kind to us .
it gets super packed .
the good : what a charming interior .
i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting las vegas .
the drinks are also awesome including the margarita flights .
delivery charge of $ 2.50 was so worth it and the meal was perfect !
the atmosphere was casual but appropriately themed .
the wait staff needs an attitude adjustment . hardly friendly or attentive .
the only thing i was n't a fan of was the lighting .
never had a bad experience .
it seems cheap but carne asada fries with a drink is still about $ 10- $ 11 dollars , and you can spend just 9 at chipotle and feel satisfied but not grossly packed in your stomach .
i 'm not the type to leave a review of a restaurant even if the experience was n't good , i just do n't return , but i felt compelled to bring attention to my latest experience that happened today .
tacky , but honestly , i think it 's amusing and gives it character .
be sure to check-in on yelp for a free speciality cocktail ( or smoothie ) .
horrible lighting , very cute painting on wall , the food is not bad , but for the price ... it should be better .
good bar to drink at ... but maybe not eat at
it 's a little pricey $ 17 for a salad with shrimp that was good but $ 17 i do n't think it was that great .
being a midwestern girl , i was super psyched when i saw culver 's locations popping up around the valley .
it was ok beer was not that great tasting you ca n't even buy a small glass of beer without buying a flight .
the wine selection is huge , and they have a fun wine legend to help you pick a wine .
ca n't beat that . let 's hope they continue with the great impression they 've made on me .
the atmosphere is attractive . reminds me of a place dates go before the movies
i tried the blackened chicken gyro and the mushroom bisque soup , and both were flavorful .
only complaint there was the crust - the bottom was soggy .
great service and authentic mexican food for a low price . the mole enchiladas are amazing
i got three small chicken breast , but it was enough . the spaghetti was just a few bites though , so way more chicken than spaghetti .
prices are more than reasonable too .
no good . clean but weird decor .
i had the chicken salad croissant and husband had the gyro .
clean the bathrooms ( shit stains , used tampon on the floor ) !
the food was fresh , presentation was perfect , and the staff that helped us out before our reception and during , was just so easy to work with .
food and service great . love all the wines by the glass .
people are so gullible to put up with the unpleasant loud music and oppressive darkness and , no it 's not ok to use your cell phone flash light because it 's painful for those who have been in the darkness awhile .
also , this place is byob - beer and wine only .
almost to the point of being annoying .
it was beautiful . the rooms were clean and spacious , the upgrade to the suite was so decadent !
the brunch tasting menu was out of this world . i chose the chicken and waffles as my entree . the service was exceptional .
we ordered beers and were served some beer cocktail they were n't bad but i just wanted the beer not a cocktail .
no stories , no wacky convo 's , no random encounters with strangers .
i purchase the groupon and placed an order over the phone for what we thought would be some awesome food , it looked great online . we then sent my coworker there ( 25min drive ) to pickup the food and they told us the groupon was n't allowed on takeout .
and the prices are excellent . plenty of food for like $ 5.99 .
this place is pretty cool .
everything is reasonably priced .
the place has great ambiance with great skyline views of cleveland being on the west side of the flats .
great food . happened to be some live music the night i ate there .
when you add in all of the tattoos , nose rings , ear discs and other face jewelry it just gives a trashy look to an otherwise beautiful restaurant .
it was cool to step into a hotel on fremont with some updating , but not overly done .
i love mcallister 's . i love their chicken salad sandwich and their potato salad and of course their tea .
freshly prepared , with fresh ingredients , you really ca n't go wrong .
- the prices are high but not high enough for me go elsewhere .
very good food for a very cheap price !
i did n't drink but i saw a good selection of their beer and a beer sampler that looked interesting .
loud , mostly bad , rock music blared ( i guess in keeping with the gogo theme ? )
exceptional wine list and large appetizers can make a meal .
open floor plans with tile floors and walls look great , but it might not be ideal for a packed fast food restaurant .
the service was terrible .
the house fried rice is amazing and the bbq korean ribs with greens was flavorful and seasoned just right .
he was very nice .
when we showed up today for a late sunday brunch the place was nearly empty and three ladies at the hostess table but none seemed to want to be bothered with seating us .
the food is consistently good . the tacos are excellent , the taco salad is fantastic .
the quality of food that you receive for the price is ridiculous .
more expensive but better service .
it was n't as creepy as some people made it sound .
the people are nice and the place is fairly well kept up for being in a college town .
the prices were quite reasonable .
we had been there an hour but this was not our fault . we were only wait to be served .
i also liked the layout of the place and the dark color scheme .
reasonable wait , okay prices for the quality we got ( ~ $ 35 for two ) , and nice interior .
their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers .
also , very expensive .
granted their `` smoked meat '' is not exactly pastrami , but it was excellent - flavorful , succulent , and tender .
loved the cold herbal tea , between my mom n i , we drank a ton .
they 're baked in individual cups so it 's a perfect portion for one .
some bites had a lot of flavoring , while others were bland .
also extremely reasonably priced .
only negative , not many beers on tap , we ordered three times before we got a beer listed that they actually had on tap : (
great casual restaurant in the heart of picturesque old montreal .
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
i 'm giving it a 4 star because i felt like the decor was a little cheesey ... the food is amazing ... it deserves matching surroundings .
we paired it with a whiskey flight , and a whiskey cocktail ( i do n't remember the name ) which was fantastic as well .
the lights kept getting dimmer and dimmer so all of a sudden i was deaf and blind : p food is so-so .
located in inside what appears to be the craziest indoor state fair like atmosphere of circus circus .
the corn bread was delicious ! being both southerners , we appreciate some good corn bread and this one was flavorful and moist .
i am sure , for a lower price , ( they charge almost $ 17 for a pie ! )
so much potential , yet the result is awkward and kinda drab .
super average . nothing was bad , but nothing was great , and the bill was $ 100+ for two people .
dessert was tiramisu and yes , it was bland too .
however , the store itself is disgusting .
the ambiance is lovely and again the food is wonderful but whether im spending 100 dollars or 300 dollars it would be nice to get the same well rounded service .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
all seafood were so fresh & tasty . the chef is very talented .
service was very attentive and music was a bonus . the atmosphere was inviting and felt very warm .
went to the counter and asked for my order , no good answer but there are 2 orders before you .
glad we ventured down the steps .
the drinks were pretty decent but not 12 dollars worthy .
expensive for something so tiny .
therapy 's drinks were amazing mostly bourbon bases with their own smoked version - they brought us a sample it was real smooth with a simple bite at the end and the bottle is gorgeous !
everything was delicious , except for french onion soup , which is simply impossible to eat , because it is terribly smelly ) ) ) .
great beers , bartenders do n't know anything about the beers . the menu is ok. not bad to pair beer with .
the pricing is reasonable .
my boyfriend got the blackened fish sandwich with the tangy slaw . the slaw was absolutely amazing !
they have a pretty good beer list , though nothing on draft .
my drink was good , i had a margarita which was the promo of the day .
nasty and weak margaritas that were being poured from a bucket . plain entrees .
the combo also came with a free cold sweetened iced tea ( which he gave to me and it was delicious ) .
also , the patio comprises a few long picnic tables , so even though it was beautiful outside , i opted to sit inside since there were only going to be two of us .
at only $ 19 for the evening , it 's already a steal if the sushi is at all good .
for what you get it 's hard to justify the cost .
love the happy hour here ! great drinks and the food was amazing .
we had a massive jug of coffee that was just perfect !
for its price , 7 numbers delivers incredible values .
great authentic food in a hip modern atmosphere .
in total for 3 alcoholic beverages ( and they were small glasses ) , 1 appetizer and 2 entrees and a 20 dollar tip it cost about $ 104 .
the washrooms were also appalling ; dirty , no toilet paper , and obvious signs that people had had sex in one of the stalls .
the service is n't over the top and frankly that feels far more natural and comfortable .
thoroughly enjoyed eating at this establishment . the amount of staff they had on hand kind of confused me until about 20 minutes in they started getting more and more patrons then it became self explanatory .
the portions are huge .
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
on top of all that , it is reasonably priced .
your bill when you leave will likely be little on the high side , but i feel that it is deserved and i do n't mind paying at all .
at my friend 's suggestion , i had a watermelon margarita , which was delicious and refreshing .
the worst thing is the bathrooms , they have run 2 four foot fluorescent lights on each side of the bathroom mirrors that are bright and obnoxious .
and the frozen margarita did n't seem to have hardly any tequila .
loved the location with its rustic and relaxed ambiance .
beer selection was weak as well , and their bottle menu was inaccurate .
but the bartenders were pretty poor at mixing a good margarita .
super flavorful , authentic , friendly and helpful staff .
for me , the spices are too light that it tasted bland for me .
of coarse this one was also cold . not only was this one cold , but it was also burnt !
honestly i felt like i was paying for the interior decoration and building .
the draft and bottle beer selection is legit , but mostly focused on regional selections which was disappointing .
key is getting the seating with the green background so cute !
environment was nice and cozy with dark lighting .
we had the deep dish pie with sausage ( amazing ) , peppers , mushrooms and pepperoni .
it was a late night and the wife has been bugging me to go here since her co-workers have been raving about this chain .
friday was fun ( legends tribute night ) ; a little loud but a great show .
i was disappointed that the main ingredient was butter , and it overpowered every other flavor , esp the lobster . i rubbed all the butter off a piece of lobster to be able to taste it , and it was honestly not very good without its butter bath .
and the price is so reasonable ( $ ) .
prices are pretty good here considering the size of the meal !
spoke to the manager very professional he said sorry still left a tip wish i had n't service was horrible
everything is good . my favorite thing is the baja fish wrap .
yes , it is hot , but worth the burn as the flavors make you forget how hot it really is .
the front counter was impossible to get to when we walked in ( people standing everywhere ) the wait time was supposedly 20-30 minutes .
the burgers are awful . mushy , small and loaded with the gross shake sauce that tastes like bland mayo .
i ordered a specifically made margarita and the bartender made it perfectly .
huh ? bartenders were ok ... though real slow getting me another beer .
the decor of the restaurant is so pretty and the little details like the side car in the front entrance really make the vibe so unique .
even the tortillas were bland and doughy . the shrimp and fish tacos were identifiable , but not much more .
it was located in the cute area of matthews .
finally our waitress comes over and says she 's so sorry and the kitchen is backed up and asks if there 's anything she could get us .
we have been looking for a good , local thai restaurant and we think we 've finally found one . plates are around $ 10- $ 12 each .
the bed was hard as a rock and the bathroom had ugly overhead fluorescent lighting and could have easily been a bathroom at a mediocre motel .
inside is a typical casual place and a little noisy given the tile floors .
they offer indoor and outdoor seating . if the weather is nice , i would recommend sitting in their patio space .
i went for brunch and it was $ 23 bucks which is relatively cheap compared to other buffets .
they do have alcohol but sadly , no full bar .
great spot for a date night or to hang out with co-workers and friends .
drinks such as wine and beer were included and it was great .
the salad looked like it was swimming in a pool of ranch dressing and the salad itself looked old . the chicken sandwich was plain .
very unique and it feels homey .
the bottled beer was nice and cold but my friend thought the tap beer was not nearly cold enough .
and the herbed out peach tea was the perfect drink to go with my food .
nice pool on top of casino area .
i was really impressed by their tequila selection and we had two fabulous margaritas during lunch .
this is the only place i will eat broccoli its delicious ! i recommend this restaurant great job keep up the good work .
but i think the quality was definitely worth it ( especially getting $ 15 off with the groupon ) .
also , their drinks were delicious ! i love their lemonade !
be prepared to bring a chunk of change with ya ... steaks costs anywhere from $ 50 to $ 60 depending on how you want it prepped or what kind of steak you want .
prices are great too .
it seemed to me like they did not want to sell too many cheesecakes as only 12 to 15 were coming out every 20-25 minutes thus a 2 - 3 hour wait time .
minor cons - bathroom is pretty ghetto looking . it just needs more lighting and a working sensor on the paper towels .
i had the bbq chicken pizza - the dough was tasteless so i did n't eat the crust . the chicken was like jerky .
a couple could probably eat an appetizer and 2 entrees for under $ 50 which is not bad compared to the other restaurants in the area .
when you add in all of the tattoos , nose rings , ear discs and other face jewelry it just gives a trashy look to an otherwise beautiful restaurant .
for only $ 9 a dozen , you can not go wrong .
the bathroom is kind of scary .
we hardly ever throw good food in the garbage .
the chicken was overcooked .
price is cheap for the kind of food they sell .
i mean it tasted like can sauce .
it 's about $ 9 for the pancakes which is pretty steep
this is our go to place for a delicious , refreshing dessert or ice tea with boba !
good service . prices good
fair prices . great selection .
both their red and green hot sauce is fantastic !
prices are reasonable and it 's a nice place for a quick lunch .
good thing was the company was better and we brought 2 bottles of wine to share .
they were overcooked and limp . the sauce was watery and bland .
a plethora of negative signs : `` bathrooms only for patrons . ''
prices are fair food is good , good is good .
the spicy salmon / tuna roll was fine but the rice was kind of dry . noodles were fine , but nothing exciting .
the food was ok but nothing special .
great place to eat !
otherwise it 's awkward .
there was also a good selection on tap , but there were no descriptions of the beers on tap , nor were there any prices for beer indicated on the menu .
the draft and bottle beer selection is legit , but mostly focused on regional selections which was disappointing .
the pita was so fresh and the best i 've had so far .
and the frozen margarita did n't seem to have hardly any tequila .
the food is excellent- particularly the 6 or so little side dishes that come with each main dish . i usually order the korean style chicken or steak and their appetizer dumplings are phenomenal !
at first i thought $ 4 for a slice of pizza was expensive .
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
prices are reasonable , amount of food is good .
we had a nice time here .
they had an excellent wine list with interesting selections .
beer selection was horrible ( typical of canada ) and on top of that they were out of the one beer that 's barely drinkable . wine selection was nearly as bad .
i usually love chilli 's , tonight my family and i decide to go for dinner to this location .
the `` og '' margarita was n't bad in flavor , but did n't have any indication that any tequila was in it .
as a side note the bartender that night ( mark ) was fantastic !
servers were good but seemed in a rush to get us out of there and yet the bill was over $ 1500 .
it is very cheap , around 4 dollars per person .
margaritas had no alcohol in them yet they were the `` special '' of the night .
however , their food not only tasted terrible on the several occasions i 've been there , it left me feeling nauseous and gave me a nasty stomach ache .
how did they not get it right ?
liked this place , but unable to give more stars because $ 13.50 was way too steep for such small portions .
the service at this restaurant was appalling .
the lighting inside is very dim , to the point of almost using my cell phone light to read the menu .
the lemon caper mayo is amazing , and it compliments the trout so well .
reasonably priced , very good food .
and i will point out the servers are very very nice .
but the bun ... my goodness . dry af .
i also loved the fried green beans too- you can tell the beans are fresh and full of crisp and the right amount of juiciness to it .
it was well done and dry , shrimp tacos only had 3 pieces of shrimp and looked undercooked .
looked like it was cooked to death and dry as the desert . feed it to the dogs .
only wished heineken was on tap , does have bottle tho .
the serving size comes in huge portions , which usually ends up as take-out .
service was prompt and attentive .
i love their basil friend rice ! you can choose your spicy level and i usually get 3 and its the perfect amount of heat and is so good !
we went on a monday and we got their daily special , which was a pitcher of sapporo and their famous japa burger to start .
if you give bad service you will get a bad tip .
i got the onion rings which were ok but not great and would probably pass on them again .
do n't order the oxtail soup . mine was full of fat and the cooks did n't bother to skim fat from the broth before it is served .
lots of conversations , cell phone and in person , filled the air , with nothing to absorb all of the sound .
prices are outrageous , 5 bucks a game is very unreasonable especially for poorly maintained lanes .
prices are very reasonable .
the one thing that was a bit annoying was that no table has just one waiter .
they were out of corona so i had a beer on tap sorry do not remember name but it was good .
my only complaint about the hotel is the way its laid out .
the food is delicious , the staff is incredibly kind , and the space is always extremely clean . boaz has been a great addition to the area and continues to be my top recommendation !
cute place that is tucked into a side street .
hopefully they are able to provide some training to fix the poor management at this restaurant .
the owner was very friendly and we chatted for a bit before leaving .
some of my favorite sandwiches and soups in the city .
great date night , or ladies out spot !
ladies were offered open bar champagne and vodka until 12:30am which was great !
highly recommend this restaurant !
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
total time took about 15 min to order and everything , so it was a lot slower than most chipotle .
i was expecting incredible flavor and it was just rather bland .
margarita tasted good , but was a little weak , i stuck to beer after having one .
the golden leaf is a mandarin flavored drink that had a nice citrus balance with the alcohol . the royal tea was smoked tea with alcohol and lemon - the citrus was a little more biting in this drink , but very refreshing .
very nice wine list .
the lighting makes it very unappetizing . the `` waiters ? ''
friday night music so loud you ca n't think , or talk . otherwise , the food and service was great .
it 's an awful piercing fluorescent white light that makes you uncomfortable .
the owner seems very nice and the service was outstanding !
not a huge fan of frosty glasses for craft beer , but it was n't so bad that there was an iceberg floating in my beer or anything .
it does get rather loud in the restaurant due to a empty ceiling and can make having a conversation with someone rather difficult .
service from the waitresses were horrible
nice selection of cheese and deli meats along with a great spread of fresh bread such as buttery croissants .
it 's spacious and has a fireplace for when it 's cold outside ( i know , not often - but i still love it ! )
that nasty smokers scent is ingrained into every piece of furniture , walls , rug , etc .
the chicken shawarma plate with bulgur and salad was tasty and the chicken was so tender and flavorful .
for the mains , the 40 day aged striploin was nothing special , dry and flavorless , although my cousin liked it .
i love this place - it 's good and reasonably priced .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
my only concern for the room was that all the lighting were programmed in uniform so if you were to turn on the lights in the bathroom , the lights in the rest of the room would light up as well .
i went to the edge of town , excited to try the new bars on the nw side of las vegas and nobody would acknowledge me or my fiancé .
honestly getting breakfast should not have taken this long .
reasonably priced and made well .
i do n't know what kind of voodoo they used to to make that breading but it was light and crispy and shattered like glass when you cut it .
the decor was atrocious ( i would rather not have to look at a statue of a naked man while i am eating ) and the walls were covered in pictures of half-naked people and pin-up girls .
this place left me feeling confused . it 's so beautiful and shiny , but so beautiful and shiny that it made me feel dirty and cheap .
my wife and i were driving out to the lake and found this little gem on the way.. and we are very satisfied we did n't pass this up .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
the only 2 beers available was budlight and `` house special beer '' which tasted like piss water .
service was very nice and attentive .
what a rip off . it 's not cheap to eat a carls jr , my bill we almost $ 17.00 .
i ordered joe 's scramble which was delicious with fresh spinach . my husband had the corned beef which was homemade .
also it was somewhat filthy , curtains , ceiling , floor and bathroom ... ... disgusting !
the prices are good and the drinks are great .
beers were not even close to full and wine poor was average .
they had a good selection of beers and something i 'd never seen before , jameson on tap . i 'm very curious as to how liquor on tap works ( and why a mexican restaurant had whiskey on tap instead of tequila ) but we did n't have the time to stay and investigate .
do n't bother with the hakka menu , or dessert , you wil be heavily disappointed .
i was sooo excited to try this place after hearing all of the hype !
every time the service has been excellent very little wait and lots of attention .
overall we got a huge dinner for under $ 50 with great service and yummy peach margaritas !
the decor looks like someones grandmothers home - who was blind - and had bad taste in wallpaper .
i had the bbq sandwich with the absolute best okra ever as a side .
it 's a very cute restaurant , super dark inside though .
we went for happy hour as a group of 6 - great service , even better food and drinks .
after such a bad experience you would think they would also cover the one glass of wine and pint of beer but nope !
when you add in all of the tattoos , nose rings , ear discs and other face jewelry it just gives a trashy look to an otherwise beautiful restaurant .
i asked for a blended margarita and was told they only do on the rocks . what kind of bar does n't have a blender ?
the ugly : -- `` ole mole '' cheese enchilada : the cheese was cold and the flavor was inedible . again , mashed black beans .
great food and drinks .
it 's huge and costs about $ 8 .
the staff is great !
the place is not visually appealing either , the vintage cluttered look only brought out the large amount of dust scattered on the decorations .
def a family favorite now .
got here , waitress seemed annoyed we were here .
they have a nice selection of appys and drinks to pair .
we came during happy hour and every bottled beer was just $ 4 . the rail drinks we 're also on happy hour special and there are nice and strong
all of this for questioning an item on the bill that should not have been there . that have lost a good patron for life .
even the nice manager stopped by our table to ask how everything was .
it was a little crowded and uncomfortable in there ( design flaw ? )
the only good part i saw was the selection of beer on tap .
the food is ok , nothing special . prices are very reasonable .
the ambiance of this sports is great . really love the fact that it 's full of locals and not tourists .
flatbread was dry and burned on the bottom .
leftover , mismatch and weird decor is everywhere .
that is about 1/2 price from the normal amount .
would be four or five if they would n't ruin good steaks .
love love love the happy hour and the extravagant drink menu .
while the seasonings and cheese were good , the actual burger patty itself was bland and somewhat dry .
beer selection was weak as well , and their bottle menu was inaccurate .
awesome restaurant with a fun 60 's hippie feel .
i was wrong - their homemade veggie burger is to die for !
draft beer was not as cold as it should be , order bottles . crappy music .
food is awful . tasteless , and not refresh .
thank you to this awesome place and brittany for saving my sanity before my wedding !
the bathroom set up is kind of awkward .
price wise it is a bit higher than anyone would like for a pizza , no doubt .
also , shout out to noelle for awesome service every time !
my only complaint is the cashier lady was very dismissive , bordering on rude .
most of the lights were out around it but the tub was relaxing and once i wiped it down it was perfect .
i also had a couple of pineapple mojito 's and it was excellent .
this place is fabulous !
their prices are reasonable , pints on special are $ 5 tax included , and the menu is small and well executed .
be sure to bring your camera , as i mentioned before , the view of the strip is amazing .
i prefer spicy dishes so it was a little on the bland side for my tastes .
i also tried the chicken sandwich , which was delicious .
music is pleasant and unobtrusive .
wines by the glass were great , service was great .
the outdoor patio was perfect for a warm early fall evening .
pretty entertaining and the prices are decent as well .
huge drink menu and my man had a beer and i took some kind of pina colada and it was very good .
enjoyed a nice evening out with the family .
the prices are very good .
they were all very good and reasonably priced .
i ordered a sangria here and it was refreshing and delicious .
patati is a charming little place to eat ridiculously cheap junk food and drink ridiculously cheap beer , but it has to be said that its food is n't particularly amazing .
be sure to have a glass of sangiovese with your meal , yum yum .
it is decorated with used retro furniture that makes me feel more comfortable than my own home .
i was n't sure why that kept happening .
we will never come here again . completely disappointed .
no complaints on not having a full glass of beer .
i love going here for lunch . i always feel welcome and the food is delicious .
the croutons were just sitting dry on top and not tossed in with the dressing .
pancakes are some of the best , however the service is rather poor received wrong order and then it took another 10 minutes to get it back . by that time i was eating cold eggs without any concern from wait staff .
not expensive at all .
best sweet potato fries and the guac was amazing !
the music , decor , and food was amazing .
very light and refreshing ( the lichee martini is their staple but a very sweet drink ) we went for the salmon and tuna tacos to start .
it 's a bit expensive here , dinner came to $ 36 ( plus tip ) per person , so make sure you come with an empty belly .
flavorful , juicy , superior steak .
absolutely love this place .
dinner prices are so very reasonable .
five stars for their bbq chicken salad minus the corn chips . one of my favorite salads of all time .
price : 20 bucks for lunch , not bad at all .
the music is nice and relaxing , perfect to study too . owner is also really friendly and tend to sing along ( which i dont mind , its nice seeing people have fun ) got the after eight tea , which was heavenly aromatic .
great bistro . staff are very attentive and great at advising .
the crust was chewy and soggy and had a weird sour taste to it .
the colors are all browns to keep with the nostalgic theme , and did i mention there are mirrors everywhere ?
they have a great happy hour menu that they offer every day from 3 to 6. they have menu items , wine , beer , and well drinks that are also on happy hour .
the prices were reasonable too .
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
they 're drinks are refreshing and we got a flask to take as a souvenir !
although we did n't try a margarita , they do have a pretty good beer selection .
i highly recommend this place .
for some reason , the soup was bland , extremely salty and not hot , the noodles seemed so so , the bamboo shoots were coarse , and the pork slices were extremely fatty .
most absurdly decadent meal i 've ever eaten , and totally delicious .
it 's inexpensive and good .
i ordered the brooklyn bridge pizza and it arrived cold and it was really bland .
my only complain : the interior is ghetto old .
every bite was perfection- so meaty , so sweet , so juicy !
i got the mahi mahi masala and my boyfriend got the shrimp korma , which were both delicious ! besides that the garlic naan was amazing with the sauces .
on my last trip , i enjoyed a delightful 40 minute wait for 1 bottle of beer .
not a bad bar .
the lackluster breakfast took a very long time to arrive .
food was n't so great for the price you paying .
i 'm so happy to have a place to get pho in goodyear .
nice ambiance inside as well . well done , guys !
but good value for the money .
my wife and i are visiting from the san francisco area , and we are always anxious to discover new restaurants .
both of the sales together came to around $ 18 , which i think is a very fair price considering the quality and the quantity that you receive .
you wo n't be disappointed !
good priced , affordable .
had a business lunch here today and was very pleasantly surprised !
the price is great .
unfortunately , the soup was extremely salty and i could only finish a quarter of it . the salad was covered heavily in ranch dressing and i could n't finish that either .
the crowd is friendly and easy going .
when you pay $ 14 for a drink you are hoping to be satisfied , and i was .
the music is always pretty good and the crowd is usually really cool .
the beer was fine , and if i had known the dos equis was only 3 dollars a bottle i would have stuck with that rather than the negra modelo .
very frustrating . the wifi is horrible - practically non-existant !
the sushi was overpriced , uninspired and not particularly memorable .
it was a bit underwhelming and the atmosphere was a bit awkward ( not sure what they are trying to accomplish with the offensively ostentatious purple neon lighting ) .
the only real downside to the place is the lack of indoor seating .
the drinks were incredible , especially the pineapple infused vodka martini .
drinks are generous . food is well prepared and moderately priced .
they had a decent draft selection and everyone said the margaritas were pretty good .
we do love our ahwatukee bosa , they usually have a good selection of donuts , even late at night .
that 's how bad the service was .
people are so gullible to put up with the unpleasant loud music and oppressive darkness and , no it 's not ok to use your cell phone flash light because it 's painful for those who have been in the darkness awhile .
she said oh wow , i do n't know where he is , okay and helped us without attitude .
good value for the price .
they have a good tequila list though i was n't drinking tonight .
it 's gorgeous and whimsical and amazing .
the decor put me off when i first visited -- -it 's kind of ugly and cliched -- -but the lighting makes up for it and creates a cozy ambiance .
great price for good food . affordable drinks too .
employees strike me as a little creepy , but hey it 's vegas .
everything is good , but the jerk chicken wings are my personal fave .
the owner also offered us a sample of his tomato sauce and it went really well with the panzerotti for the veal sandwhich , it was meaty and delicious !
creepy , i know ) .
i think my favorite part was that you have to lock up your cell phones and watches ( basically anything that might emit light or sound ) in a locker outside of the restrooms .
very small restaurant , very reasonable prices .
and did i mention that the margarita was very weak ? i think the bartender forgot the tequila .
the jonas shrine in the bathroom hallway was a little creepy and confusing but apparently the owners are maybe kin ?
nice big starbucks ! nice enough to hold a meeting or camp out for a work sesh .
the decor is still there- though seems dirty to me , but my boyfriend insists that it is intentional distressing on the artwork . whatever .
the bread is good too -- not amazing , but good .
the only reason to come is to drink beer out of the schooner glasses but alas they only have crap beer on tap .
their vegetarian ingredient salad is amazing as well as their eggplant dish .
the food was cold and the variety you would expect for a buffet was mediocre . even the dessert station was seriously lacking .
the draft and bottle beer selection is legit , but mostly focused on regional selections which was disappointing .
the ice cream was a lighter than most shops and the variety of unique flavors was a nice surprise .
not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses , that were more like scotch glasses , only knock .
the food was cold .
disappointing so he tried another drink which he really enjoyed and my drink was good but definitely they pour with a very light hand .
sakana had great reviews so we went . we had a great time !
great vibe and decor although the lighting was so dim it caused eye strain and dried out my contacts .
our waitress amanda was friendly and attentive . the food was wonderful .
the ambiance was nice sitting outside with the little birds flying over head .
for $ 6.95 , which is a great deal . in my opinion .
but it really happened , and if you do n't want to ask for a terribly day , just do n't go there .
as for the drinks , they are pretty cheap .
also a good portion , done to perfection .
every time i am in the area i make it a point to stop here and that will not change , only wish i was around more often .
i ordered the shrimp with soba noodles . it 's a cold dish and was really good .
shrimp was overcooked , steak was overcooked , ham was dry and over cooked , just all around bad .
easily a $ 100+ dimsum meal for 4 , the food was tasty and i guess you 're paying for the experience .
it 's a cool spot .
also the vegan options are amazing as well .
i must 've come here a year ago with my entire family .
we loved the clams in garlic sauce too .
it was long but we were happy to get seated immediately and have a frosty peachy sangria .
it gets quiet and uncomfortable while she 's yelling . the dining room gets a little quiet and it ruined our breakfast .
more like the instant ones from a box .
i ordered the linguine pescatore and asked that it not be served spicy as i noticed it had a hot pepper symbol on the menu .
a good deal but i understand if you have the m card ( which we do ) can still save $ 5 per person . venue is still beautiful and recommend especially if you use a deal .
the floors were like fly paper when you walked in . your feet practically stuck to the floors .
the restaurant looks nice too .
would n't be fair .
no tap beer , no blended drinks for a decent margaritas and out of steak for tacos .
the only complaint is the drink prices ... $ 5 for a 12 oz oj // $ 5 for a small bottle of smart water but hey how else are they going to pay the rent inside the cosmo
dirty , dates , needs maintenance , poor customer service .
i asked about beer selection and was disappointed that they only carried the standard domestics and imports .
the bathroom was disgusting and out of paper towels . the floors were dirty and it looked like the toilet had been leaking making the floor wet .
there was only one other table in the restaurant .
it was the perfect setting !
we started off with the mussels which were topped with bacon of all things and they were absolutely delicious .
the lychee martinis were good and not over sweet .
the cost of the dinner here is a bit more expensive than your typical sushi establishment .
they say it 's fare is mediterranean but there are offerings of trout to awesome burgers and salads always come with your mains .
delicious food , great portions , crispy hash browns ... excellent . a must for breakfast .
i recommend any of their specials- my current favorite is a cheese panini that is delicious .
the bartender was pretty bad .
although we did n't try a margarita , they do have a pretty good beer selection .
the ugly : nothing too ugly here neutral : no seating , purely a takeout joint .
i had the lunch combo . ginger chicken , wontons and rice .
my favorite sides are the tabbouleh ( sometimes spelled tabouli ) which is `` tomatoes , finely chopped parsley , mint , bulgur and onion , and seasoned with olive oil , lemon juice , and salt '' ( thank you wikipedia ) and fattoush which is cucumber , tomato , onion , and parsley .
the menu is very brief but very difficult to read with the lack of lights .
i had the flautas which were very hard to cut they were so overcooked .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
i paired it with the champagne they had on the happy hour menu which was very good .
it was n't terribly spicy .
excellent ! friendly service easy to find and of course great food !
rib firecrackers were tasteless inside which is a shame because the waitress raved about them , and the buffalo chicken tacos were seasoned on the overkill side and needed something to break the intensity .
paintings ) are weird , but i guess they 'd be good ice breakers or conversation starters .
the colors are all browns to keep with the nostalgic theme , and did i mention there are mirrors everywhere ?
antoinette and michael are very welcoming and extremely polite .
cool atmosphere , fun crowd , great food .
it seemed like it took forever to get orders placed and food from the kitchen , but the nice buzz made up for it .
now that i think about it , the whole meal is dry and tasteless . maybe i went at the wrong time .
this place gets it right .
the margaritas and drinks are all very bland and watered down despite what they advertise as `` 1800 '' tequila .
bring cash to get the special rate for 16 inch one item pizza @ $ 9.99 .
this is the best yelp decision i have ever made . ever since i yelped sushi places in las vegas and came across this gem , it has been nothing but amazing !
sorry , have to bring down the review a star because i came here again 2 weeks later with 9 girls and the service was terrible again .
it was disappointing and was just ok as far as taste .
the drink itself was delicious , but the bubbles were kind of hard , not chewy and warm like what i was expecting .
only had water to drink so can not comment on the drink or beer pours .
white sangria was tasty and booze and as of happy hour was only 5 $ .
eclectic little place . dark and cozy .
the texture was interesting , and i was n't sure whether to chew the seeds or just swallow them whole .
its a little chilly in there so do n't expect to be comfortable and warm at the same time during the winter .
not bad for the price .
beautiful atmosphere and layout .
it 's super expensive ... we paid a total of $ 900 for 8 people for a combo meal .
it 's how long they wait to get your drink order , then food order , then check , it 's kind of silly .
the starters were okay . the weekend buffet was mediocre .
on top of that the bathrooms were disgusting . water and liquids everywhere , soggy paper towels on the ground and rags sitting around in the stalls and on the sink .
the food selection was awesome , the taste perfect to your taste .
we immediately went at sat at the bar and she then came dashing over with attitude suggesting we were in the wrong for going and sitting down .
we ordered a house wine and a draft beer , nothing complicated .
they looked amazing and were not disappointing .
as soon as i walked in , i can tell that the lady at the register was in a horrible mood .
room was dirty , lots of hair , drips on ceiling while showering , bathroom sink did not drain at all , noisy , carpet was stained , room smelled badly of smoke , not sure how it 's actually non smoking .
solid chicken place at a reasonable price .
- i 've seen some pretty rude things done by york region socially oblivious patrons ( like being rude to other patrons ) .
very nice interior too .
their wine list is limited , so we went with a syrah and i ca n't remember the name but it paired exquisitely well with the food .
the price is cheap ! the food is average , but for the price you ca n't complain !
i asked about beer selection and was disappointed that they only carried the standard domestics and imports .
the atmosphere is really cute and intimate .
good service and speedy . very pleasant .
the outdoor seating was relaxing and had a great atmosphere .
the best thing is the happy hour- 1/2 off drinks .
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
order the lunch special if you want to have a decent entree with a drink for ~ $ 10 .
it is tad expensive but i will any day pay that premium to have top quality indian food .
they had their banana pudding on sale and that was the only disappointment . the wafers tasted soggy and it had to be consumed by end of day so that explains the $ 1 pudding .
the beer menu was pretty weak . they did n't have much on tap and the bottle selection was just as poor .
also the pricing is very modest .
the ugly : nothing too ugly here neutral : no seating , purely a takeout joint .
the cashier was rude , food was bland , and found hair in two of the four dishes we had ordered .
good ambience and prices are reasonable .
the pre-fix should have been priced at $ 45 total for the portions you presented .
so glad we tried this place !
i was feeling lazy after orchestra rehearsal on sunday evening , so i decided to try pizza break .
seafood oyster mushroom : decent presentation and tasted ok , a little heavy on the sauce crabmeat fin soup : very salty but tasted pretty good .
my server allyson is awesome .
quiet , comfortable , good service !
definitely will be returning to this vegas spot for lunch again , we loved it !
we only do wine and beer at the bar . ''
food is so good and they are very reasonably priced .
the pork dumplings were also delicious .
: ) i also had the lime pilsner beer ... .it was the perfect refreshing beer for a hot phoenix friday .
no stars for the tired , drab & dusty interior .
the meat was extremely dry and had tiny bones stuck in the meat .
had a awesome experience here today .
and just like everyone else mentions , the customer service is absolutely horrible . truly .
the prices are reasonable .
their price is reasonable as well .
i understand being in construction things do not go right and that applies to restaurants .
food prices are affordable and good .
patio was peaceful and the weather was perfect .
i ordered the sangria and my mom had one of their margaritas ( only $ 5 each ) .
the pork was dry and cold with average taste .
the coffee is decently priced and is decent itself .
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
luckily though , my drink was just right , balancing tart and sweet , and still being refreshing .
thanks for an incredible experience .
great prices and value .
friendly bartenders . a great virgin marg probably great with alcohol as well !
the only reason this place is getting two stars , is because the food did n't take forever to come out .
i 'm currently enjoying a lychee slush and it is delicious !
the salad was great could of been better with big croutons but the chicken was cooked well and chopped up nice and thinly plus very well seasoned .
i ordered another drink as the beer flight was hardly anything .
great place to eat .
i had the cesar salad which was incredible with the chicken .
the decor was also very interesting . especially the bathroom .
they are nice and spend few minutes to go over what you want but they are not willing to put time and effort to do what you really want .
the table had a big step up and was terribly awkward for him .
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
the major problem this time was the music - blaring so loud overhead that it felt like we were being beat up - it was mentally exhausting .
i 've had better , and especially since it was for $ 18 , not worth it .
you do not need to make an unnecessary loud beep from the push of the buttons lol i was trying to adjust it while everyone was sleeping ... awkward .
it was so unprofessional , rude and just made her look totally absurd .
well the food and presentation was good .
that 's pretty outrageous for a item with such little cost .
we were seated in a fair amount of time , maybe 4-5 mins but i think we waited for almost 10 minutes just for the waitress to come get our order .
the owner jim is always there , working along with his wonderfully trained staff , overseeing & making the patrons feel welcome & special .
i chose rusconi 's for my birthday dinner after it popped up on yelp as having good vegetarian options , and watching the check please arizona spot about it .
it 's classy but with sparkle ... if that makes sense hehe .
as manager walked by three times and ignored me i finally asked him straight out can i get a cup please while i wait for the burger .
that 's the only answer .
calamari was too sour ( possibly the way it was supposed to be ) and it did n't look freshly fried .
do n't know if it 's a glitch in their lighting or the electrical service , but it got a bit annoying .
the coffee is very good and the service is prompt and pleasant .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
do n't let the cozy fireplace fool you .
the curly fries are highly recommended ! they 're served piping hot and make an excellent cheap snack for those nail biting games .
the shrimp on the stone appetizer is simply delicious and their entries are authentic and well done .
never felt out of place or uncomfortable .
the hostess were pretty rude and staring down the girls i was with who felt a little offended .
the restaurant is small but really cute !
it 's right by boyfriend 's house and all the other pizza places around him have n't been that great .
i felt like the walls in this place needed a more color or something ... decor seemed to be pretty plain and did n't really go w/the vibe of the place .
for $ 42 dollars you would expect hot food delivered accurately .
he is a great server .
the prices are reasonable too .
the prices were reasonable .
the price is high for the quality you receive .
there was a crude and lewd drawing hanging on the chandelier and there was not adequate towels linens or pillows .
additionally , the draft beer was only slightly chilled .
so it basically looked like four pieces of bruschetta and then a bowl that took up 1/2 the plate filled with a sauce for dipping .
they served us these complimentary fries with some seriously good dipping sauces .
when you order delivery u can expect to wait 1-3 hours for food ( not an exaggeration ) so if you were expecting hot food please lower your expectations .
i would give it 5 stars if they did not have such bright fluorescent lighting , which makes the place feel like a hospital cafeteria .
after fucking 15 minutes of waiting , the woman who handed me my order asked me if i wanted any sauce .
my only complaint would be that they have a certain driver who pretty much demands a tip from you . other than that they have n't disappointed me yet .
very good food at very reasonable prices .
the price itself is only $ 89 per person , which if you 've been to any degustation restaurant you 'd know it was a steal !
quite tasty ! for dinner we ordered their trout special served with meat sauce pasta and the carbonara .
so glad we found this place .
because i voiced a complaint in my yelp review after two very bad deliveries , your delivery driver who i recognize from coming to my front door over and over because his picture is on his yelp profile is sending me nasty comments and remarks .
the only disappointment is the broth .
the atmosphere is great and the windows are amazing in this place .
btw , prices are pretty good for what you getting !
price was decent $ 20 for 2 people to eat with leftovers .
dim lighting - lighted menus would be nice and i expected them but no dice .
this place is good . the price is very reasonable .
i could only eat about 5 bites and i was done .
great wine selection also .
the burger , fries and drink combo came out be like $ 14 a decent price for the quality and quantity .
it had lovely mint flavor and a bit light on the alcohol .
seemed pretty clear it had been cooked before being cooked again ( or warmed up ) for my meal .
good food for a good price .
the shrimp dumplings were absolutely delicious .
good food , decent prices .
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
the restaurant bathroom is just plain dirty .
it 's a nice gesture for the price you 're paying .
menus one star cause the inside is kind of dark and dingy feel .
at full price would have been over $ 100.00 .
the sofas look like they were stolen from the common room of a college dorm and free pool on a table salvaged from the junkyard .
4. the entire place was out of all draft beer except some shitty orange something .
my girlfriend had the halibut with a beurre blanc sauce that was also excellent .
but the bartenders were pretty poor at mixing a good margarita .
honestly , the renovation made it look so nice , but the food quality is really only worth $ 8 and not the full price .
kind of like feet .
i would of loved a glass of wine with my delicious steak .
the pizzas and pastas are actually very good . cesar salad is good .
the restaurant is adorable and overlooks the strip from its perch above henderson .
well my fellow yelpers butterfields is a breakfast place that always seems to get the food right .
hate businesses that are not honest and ruin the whole dining experience .
my bf had the ribs they was absolutely dreadful , really hard and was n't even edible . i had the pulled pork it was so so .
prices were somewhat above average , not the greatest value . sorry-
the interior 's nothing fancy but it was n't uncomfortable and was fun to read some of the signs on the wall .
it should be noted that halfway through the pizza , when the waiter decided to come ask if it was okay , i finally got to ask for my refill .
and babe & her team are awesome - efficient , fun and engaging , and smart .
service is very friendly .
honestly i 'd rather spend the extra $ 1.50 and take my money to cold stone .
space is tight , but it is a quaint spot that is good for a date or catch up with a small group of friends one lazy afternoon .
the beer was cold , they have jameson and a tequila on draft and they serve tacos late .
the steak sandwich was ridiculously good !
delicious food and coffee , reasonable prices , and great service in a cute and cozy atmosphere . they also have a great outdoor patio for when the weather is nice .
the dining area was bad . if i had been paying better attention to the dining area when i walked in , i would have walked out after seeing the condition of it .
great food , ambiance and a beautiful outdoor patio on a golf course setting . never been disappointed in a meal there and honestly the best steak in town .
the price is so cheap .
the service was terrible and really slow .
drink specials were great .
maybe it was my own ignorance , but i was expecting something else and the individual katsu sauces should have been a tip .
prices ar a little high but you are at the bellagio .
all in all , it 's an incredibly attractive space , and tempe should consider itself lucky to have such a well thought out concept .
the price for main courses is 20-35 dollars , so not cheap but not crazy expensive .
an amazing list of wine and beer !
horrible customer service given that you pay so much for a burger .
mediocre food . high prices .
sorry but i do n't ask for my waiter as this is supposed to be a service business.. we left and walked right across to the summit room which is always great .
the prices were a bit higher than i would pay but great for the novelty .
you 're better off spending $ 10-20 more for decent food at one of the other restaurants nearby .
quite a lot of food for reasonable prices .
we plan to return but , jenni please turn down the garish annoying overhead lighting !
the food looked pretty , but did not satisfy .
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
their price is very cheap and reasonable and the portions are more than enough .
the only beer they had was budweiser .
decent food . cheap and decent service .
their cocktail list is impressive so we ordered a trio of em .
at least the beer was decent .
my gin & tonic was a bit too strong ( he even went and added tonic after i mentioned it and it was still too strong ) .
i think the total was about $ 30 .
lunch special is a good deal .
the restroom was pretty nasty , urine on the toilet seat , on the floor , trash filled up , trash on the floor , and only one restroom for one customer .
the prices are very reasonable .
had she not already taken our order , i 'd just have walked up there myself . avoided it the entire rest of my stay ~
my girlfriend and i have been taking our friends here as often as we can and the prices are reasonable as well .
be warned , it 's very bright in the place . it 's kinda like a 60 's kitchen style decor , so it feels very bright and echoey .
its not particularly cheap , but its not expensive - the beers will vary in prices so there 's something for everyone !
the waiter made a recommendation for the cucumber blueberry martini - it was great !
we got the bangkok fried rice & the green curry . the curry had the perfect level of spice & was super tasty .
the only reason to come is to drink beer out of the schooner glasses but alas they only have crap beer on tap .
the food is unimpressive compare to the price you pay , service was mediocre .
sorry for the low rating , but it could not be helped .
love the food and drinks .
they were just awful and i do not think the tequila was patron .
the price is okay considering that 's how much a high end buffet costs anyway .
and the cashier made a joke when she asked me how everything was and i replied that it was horrible .
i do n't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine .
finally , when it was my time to order , the worker informed me that they do n't have the normal `` del taco '' menu because they 're new ! what ?
everything we tried was wonderful : ) i had their paloma margarita , which had squirt in it ; i 've never had that in a margarita and it was so good !
this place is a great bargain .
i met a friend here for happy hour and it was exactly as i remembered it .
expecting to spend over $ 100 : ) but it 's well worth it !
the drinks were great .
all in all , it was delicious .
the hotel staff made sure we were well provided for . the housekeepers were thorough and friendly .
i have been here twice and i absolutely love it .
the beer was cold and in a pint glass .
i was mostly disappointed in the food though , and when i pay as much as they are asking , i expect something better than greasy fries and bland meat .
got our drinks ( glass of wine and a bottle of bud light ) in a timely fashion and ordered two small appetizers ( crab cake and meatballs ) .
the price is very good .
i go there for the bbq , but their sides are authentic and fresh .
the vibe here was really nice .
my parents chose the chicken and said it was flavorful and cooked well .
the service is top-notch and the everybody is very friendly .
drink were ok the service is spread too thin only 1 server and even with a small crowd , we waited 20 mins to get a drink .
we did n't mind paying $ $ $ for a great dining experience .
the food is delicious and the price for the value can not be beat .
excellent coffee and the owner is always the sweetest !
the pita was fresh , hot , and the perfect complement to my salad .
order taken wrong . servers so distracted by call ins that they completely ignored .
the flavors were incredible and the porchetta absolutely took me back to nights wandering around campo de fiori . i will definitely be back to try everything else but this was the perfect introduction .
it 's a warm little place .
the price is good too .
prices are extremely reasonable .
i did not ask for any special tequila .
and for the price it is ridiculous . it was mediocre at best with a premium price tag .
for my entree i got the scallops and the brussel sprouts which were both very good , though i 've had better scallops . finally they gave us cookies as a complimentary dessert which were very rich and delicious !
did n't taste pleasant . disappointed .
cheap and good food .
5 stars for being such great hosts to a couple of meetings i helped organize in their board room and for the attention they always give to their clients . great service and great coffee shop !
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
it was pretty decent especially for how cheap it was .
$ 10 for a plate is pushing it too far considering the amount of locations they have .
the bar is very uncomfortable .
atmosphere : very clean , modern , and bright inside .
prices were not that high so if your looking for a three person all you can eat meal for under $ 300 then its a cool place to eat and flavorful
my bf got the chicken fried steak , which he could not finish becuase it was too fatty .
pretty basic stuff very friendly prices are reasonable .
i started with a lovely cocktail with a lychee flavour . delicious !
wow that was the worst koryo meal i 've ever had : ( the potatoes were probably day old and received , the meat was obviously recooked since it was dried up , the bean sprouts tasted like salty tap water . it was pretty bad i could n't finish my meal .
strong drinks . great time .
4. is your idea of restaurant ambiance to decorate with stuff found in the dumpster behind goodwill ?
they also make very good mojitos ... .
the lighting can be a little awkward when trying to read the menus , but impossible , it is not .
this place has a great atmosphere with tv 's and the enormous amount of young people .
they charge $ 50 per person which is definitely more expensive than the other churrascaria that i have been to .
we only do wine and beer at the bar . ''
tasted fresh with thin skin and juicy filling .
the price for the quantity is very very reasonable .
for the prices this restaurant charges , the service should be at least moderately attentive .
pretty good . small place but okay food good prices right downtown .
$ 118 ai n't cheap but the wine retails for about $ 70 so the markup was reasonable and we had the time to sit and drink and enjoy .
the fish tastes fresh , is grilled perfectly , is accompanied ( read : piled high ) with creamy cole slaw and mango salsa that capture a real island feel .
the veggie burger is so delicious , also the honey pasta salad .
good home cooked food .
the prices are fair .
i doubt there was 1 oz of fish in the entire order . it was all rice and mayo .
the eggplant was okay - presentation was on the sloppy side though .
the wine selection is superb , also has a pretty good bottled beer selection . their wine tastings on thursday evenings are a great deal with selections from around the globe .
so we then argue about our wrong order of drinks and 10 minutes later he finally gets tired of arguing how we ordered wrong and says this time only he would change the drinks for no charge .
when we tried ordering drinks he gave us an attitude and took a very long time to bring us our order .
it was bland chicken with mushy breading around it .
it cost approximately $ 10 for a taco and a potato .
i am very happy and will return when in the area
beers were ok , but they were bottled beers , so it would be pretty difficult for them to ruin that .
fair prices , good service .
being the only black couple in here , we watching people walk in and get served as we were told our order did n't go through because of the printer did n't send it through .
maybe they have changed this because i did not get what i was accustom to : ( i would n't refer customers to order to-go
good food at a reasonable price !
loved this place ! i was so sad when i moved away .
the biggest thing was that one of our sides was cold and bland ... and had a hair in it .
the prices are really cheap .
they also have a full bar with a drink menu which i was pretty happy about !
we orders a bottle of wine and our food was great .
the prices arent too bad either at all , with flights for around 15 bucks .
it 's fucking expensive . seriously , i do n't usually complain much about price with food , but $ 4 for a slice is absurd .
my drinks were delicious and the coconut drink was awesome as well .
beer selection was good , but a gastropub should have unique vessels for drinks . cider in a guinness pint glass is just ... .wrong .
north mountain brewing is a cool addition to the neighborhood .
drinks were great as well !
( saturday , 5pm ) burgers were really good - the buns are fresh and the fresh ground beef had awesome flavours .
i was heading over to eat here but wow !
beer selection was large however , so i 'm sure beer drinkers enjoy that . i do not really drink beer though .
i like that it 's welcoming and warm and cozy .
everything is very moderately priced considering the quality of the food , service , and atmosphere .
no one to welcome or direct us to our table until we asked to be seated .
i also had a specialty drink recommended by our waiter which was very good and refreshing .
i understand that everyone has a bad night , but the customer should not suffer !
decent fresh food with reasonable pricing .
the food was all reasonably priced , including a $ 5.99 kids meal .
good prices - tasty food .
the fish itself tasted pretty fresh , i just did n't like the sauce they put on top , so i just scraped it to the side . the rice and good , but the chicken that they cooked was really dry , so i did n't eat that .
the ambience of this place is really cool , they have drawers at every table that are filled with notes from past customers .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
the manager cindy , was walking by & inquired to why my disappointed expression . a quick chat took place between us , she gave me a refund & kindly requested that i return when i had the time to give grande cafe another chance .
the lighting was a little weird too .
it would n't be so dissatisfying if it did n't have so much potential .
when the waiter finally came to me he just asked what i wanted and not the drink order first .
we sat for 15 minutes before a server even came over which was ok since we were chatting but we sure got thirsty .
the fried chicken want seasoned .
there 's ample seating , and a nice little bar area along the window you can sit and gaze out , while you sip your drink and contemplate life ... or work .
lighting was harsh too . not exactly sure why it felt that way , but very bright for a restaurant .
ordered 2 small fountain drinks for my kids ( $ 3.90 total ) and they wanted $ 1.00 each for refills .
the service at this hotel is great too . very overly helpful .
the wait was ridiculous .
i highly recommend stopping by for a beer , tequila , or margarita !
this place is n't fancy at all but it seems clean and is very reasonably priced .
for the drinkers , the sake is delicious and generously portioned !
the draft list was n't bad but nothing out of the norm .
the lighting can be a little awkward when trying to read the menus , but impossible , it is not .
they have an amazing happy hour as well as cocktails to dazzle a pallet .
the service was excellent and the prices are so inexpensive it 's a real value !
if you decide to go off the happy hour menu , they have a large selection of cocktails and an impressive sake selection .
but , the prices are too expensive .
the only thing upscale was the cost .
lighting seems to be just right .
great price . $ 6 for a meal ?
i 'm willing to bet our margaritas had no tequila in them .
the service . is terrible .
both were excellent , melt in your mouth .
the sizes of the pieces of fish he served me with the nigiri were borderline ridiculous .
they had basically taken katsu that had been fried and cut up and re-fried it and yes , it was nasty and nothing like what chicken katsu is when it is done fresh .
my new favorite restaurant in pittsburgh .
service is courteous and quick , which helps maintain a relaxed but professional atmosphere .
i did n't order any beer or cocktails , but looked like a great selection of beer .
i also ordered a really delicious pineapple martini .
we made it in time for happy hour and had a few spritzer , fruity in flavor and all refreshing .
they even brought me the grenadine in a cute little shot glass .
there are many beautiful people there .
he 's creepy , not classy , not sophisticated , and forced his way into our table 's conversation .
super weird flashing lights randomly turn on and sweep over the restaurant .
the fresh handmade noodles are great , broth needs a bit more seasoning , but then again it 's better to be able to add salt than to eat something that 's too salty to begin with .
strong drinks , good service .
the drink specials were pretty good and decently priced .
service was receptive without being overbearing , kat was friendly and bubbly ! margarita was refreshing but a tad on the sweet side .
the prices are very high .
the lunch special is at a great price too .
he knew that menu inside and out and given only a price range , selected an excellent bottle of wine for us .
the food was good , but one of our pasta was serve cold and it was just very upsetting .
apparently they only know how to pour beers and make margaritas .
craft beers were about 5-6 which is n't too bad .
i am happy to report the patio is dog-friendly .
it 's only $ 29 with the half-off discount and it 's around 18 ounces ( no bone ) if i remember correctly .
i ca n't comment on their food because i did n't get a chance to eat there , but with their poor attitude , bad customer service and outright lies to the customers , my guess is that they do n't put in that much effort in making good food either .
the prices are fair and the drinks are solid and also very fairly priced .
finally got a chance to try a new place in south brampton .
the furniture here was outdated and not to fit the theme , but just nothing aesthetically pleasing .
the majority of the ingredients they tout on the menu disappear into a sea of bland . no depth .
and she simply responded , `` they 're all dirty . ''
ordered the following : 1 ) hainan chicken : this portion size was huge but the chicken was basically just boiled and then put on the platter .
i know most beer drinkers prefer piss like corona and budweiser and heineken , but us beer snobs are kind of left in the cold it seemed .
i had the worst experience . the customer service is nonexistent .
the salmon kama was very small and did not have much seasoning at all . while the spicy yellowtail was delicious , the spicy salmon was not spicy at all and what was worse was the salmon itself was room temperature : ( .
had a wonderful brunch . the doors were open and it was cool and breezy .
i love this place . this is a must-go restaurant in vegas .
but you know what , for $ 20 bucks , not sure i can really complain here .
my only issue was the rice was kinda dry and hard instead of sticky as how i like my sushi rice .
we ordered drinks afterwards and i got a brew from noda and my mom got the pineapple mango mojito . she enjoyed hers .
looked like they had a good selection of beer on tap , even though i did n't have any .
we came here again and enjoyed their $ 3.50 margaritas which as usual were delicious , but not particularly potent .
when they opened , pricing was around $ 8-10 per item , a reasonable premium for the quality .
took 20 minutes to get a drink . waitress seemed irritated she had to serve us which i do n't know why because our bill was $ 400 and she would get a nice tip from us .
i wonder if he was telling us that the food was free because it was just ok ?
disappointing all around . beer was ho-hum .
very mediocre . the food was good but not worth the price tag .
the prices are also very reasonable .
now the food , i have tried many of their dishes and my favorite is their legendary chicken and waffles .
i just wish the place was more acoustically kind to not have conversations etc bouncing off the walls and ceiling .
i was quiet uncomfortable because the experience was true to what a blind person feels .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
am i the only one who thinks barbecue dinner for 2 should n't cost $ 75 ?
the restaurant itself is kind of ... dingy .
and my food which i assumed was cooked to order was only lukewarm .
the atmosphere and decor was warm , classy and very inviting .
the atmosphere was also horrible . the lighting was insufficient , and place just looked pretty outdated .
the views of the skyline inside were amazing , so i can only imagine how awesome they are from their rooftop !
even after not eating all day and being drunk and starving , the food was still horrible - bland , dry , just overall bad ( got the chicken burrito per the waitress 's recommendation ) .
tap water was filtered and good , nice hot teas ( we had green and jasmine , both were excellent ) .
all were flavorful and amazing .
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
the texture was terrible .
i started with a grapefruit mimosa , which was delicious and appropriately priced .
on top of that , the bathroom was filthy .
you only get 8 tiny pieces of meat and if you were to pay regular price this table set costs 29 bucks itself . so not worth it especially if you can pay 15 dollars for all you can eat at korean bbq places .
the mix of scottsdale hangovers and arcadia church goers makes the people watching fun ( if you 're not seated in front of a brick wall ) and the staff was charming - despite the craziness !
great space to hang out and do work or listen to some music when they have bands .
the food : very flavourful , we had the chicken burritos & tacos alongside the guac .
my boyfriend and i absolutely loved this cafe !
the server took forever to bring out my dishes and i was getting really impatient .
more than a quarter of the menu is delicious vegetarian choices . the crepes are large .
it comes in one size only and cost around $ 4 .
suggested walnut crest 2012 merlot the whole bottle for $ 10 , it is a very smooth merlot , we were quite surprised !
my only problem was the service .
drinks were delicious but a little pricey at $ 19 each .
we shared an antipasto , soup and salad and had our own main meals .
great french food with fabulous service ! the filet mignon , escargot , and beef tartare were delicious .
good points : text messaging to notify you seating is available , large restaurant and bar , and entertaining to watch people ride the mechanical bull . down side : very loud inside , difficult to hold conversations , service was slow , food was not served hot , and for a place that advertises rock music , i only heard 1 rock song out of 10 songs played .
plus it 's cheap . almost as good as it gets .
we were able to bring our own bottles of wine and drink our own selections .
the place has gotten very expensive and the steaks , although good , are not `` over the top '' for the prices you pay .
it 's a step up from a sports bar as far as the decor goes .
the restaurant itself looks nice , although the interior plywood siding gives it an `` unfinished '' feeling that i was n't very fond of .
only two dishes and the meal cost over $ 30 .
also , the wine pairing was great .
not that expensive either .
good prices , great food .
it gets crowded late night and they have opened up a great game room for a casual hang .
one kind of beer .
you would think after all these horrible reviews , they would try and find a new manager and staff . disappointing .
the atmosphere is nice and very relaxed .
they also only have beer , no wine at all .
oh , and reeeeally weird art in the girl 's bathroom ... .
lots of great choices on their menu .
i went with the fried chicken breast , served with garlic mash and veggies topped with country style gravy and my husband picked a rack of ribs , i hate to compare but famous dave 's wins in the food category by far . service was n't amazing but the entire experience all in all was so so .
the horseradish cream it got served with was nice but i 'm sad i needed it so badly .
i do n't want to rip this place but when you are paying high dollar for food , you expect more ( i do n't mean quantity ) .
the bread and mash was delicious .
my daughter and i enjoyed a quiet late lunch on a sunday afternoon . the food was good and the atmosphere was special .
the service is horrible .
my bf brings me to all the good places here in vegas , and this is my place for pho !
the service is pretty fast and the prices are average .
it did n't taste as fresh ran out of a lot of ingredients it was only 1pm ... not a fan .
it is very important to highlight that you wont be seated unless you come with the whole group of people .
the prices are relatively cheap for the quality of food .
i was very surprised at how great everything was considering this is a newer spot , but they seem to have worked out any kinks and i look forward to many more visits !
an all around depressing meal for the $ 17 walk out per person ( i drank water ) .
great for a friday night out with the family !
on a positive note , the drinks were good and the goblet drinks are a pretty good deal during happy hour .
it used to be $ 11 for chicken entree but today they charge $ 18 !
the bottled beer was n't as cold as we like it .
had flavor and was n't bland . the only complaint i had was the food was n't `` hot '' it was room temperature .
upstairs has a nice view of the bar below and all the lit bottles on the walls as well as more flat screens playing sports , and theres a pool table .
the entire bathroom was filthy : no soap , no paper towels and the locks on the stalls are missing .
honestly the wait for our server feels like it was longer than the wait for our food- which is questionable as well .
i would n't foresee it being a problem as we arrived at 3 o'clock when happy our first started and it was a monday , and there was hardly anybody in there .
i ordered the ziti , which was not the smallest i 've seen but not huge either .
the guacamole mto menu was awesome . we got the traditional guac with just one added item and it was delicious .
we are really happy to have it extended north .
the to go menu prices on their website are wrong and my ticket was $ 15 higher than planned . $ 15 ?
beautiful set up for watching the game .
i ordered a mango strawberry lemonade and absolutely loved it !
the service was great . there is also a patio outside which would be really nice during summer .
so now you only get about 33 % discount , pay $ 16 for $ 24 value for two , when before you got 50 % , but the requirement to buy one food item has always been the same .
i 'm assuming you do survive because the drunks that go there after the club do n't give a shit as to their service or the quality of food just something to fill the void .
they all kind of tasted the same .
happy hour all day on wednesdays and really great food and cocktails !
when i 'm spending $ 20+ per plate ( there are 5 of us ) , i do not expect to sweat the entire meal .
somewhat full bar not just beer and wine they do have liquor as well .
the prices were very reasonable .
this is my only choice among the various choices of katsu in the menu ! love it
i 'm sorry , this place needs better management that understands operations and customer service .
except our booth was basically a table for 1. it felt like they just threw another hair there . my husband felt awkward the entire time while dining .
price - very good .
my friends and i went for happy hour around 5. we split a pitcher of the regular house margarita .
the employees were very nice and our server always made sure we were doing ok. i had a drink called purple rain , which is their variation of the long island iced tea , but with a blue raspberry flavor , i believe .
the consistency is great and even has a grilled flavor . the sauce and cheese compliment the burgers so well .
our poor waitress was trying but had zero multitasking skills .
for a medium busy restaurant on a week night we had to wait to give our order , get our drinks , fries were cold when delivered to the table , replacements never came , we were basically ignored for the rest of the meal had to flag our waiter down for drink refills and another waitress to pay .
the total was 27 $ ... that 's pretty pricey considering the quality of this meal ... feels like a waste of money to me .
i used to love that restaurant because not just the beautiful view to the lake but the excellent service and delicious food .
order was taken and 40 minutes later they brought out our food and both orders were wrong . sad .
my total came out to be a little more than $ 12 , which is not bad .
the dinner menu is mall priced ( inflated ) but the selection is good .
we walked in without an online reservation for seating and were given a 2.5 hour estimate wait time , but luckily , were told we could look for open seating at the bar and still get served food !
the lemonade was amazing , not too sweet , nice , cold and refreshing .
prices are very reasonable .
super good food at reasonable prices .
overpriced food at an expensive price .
the wienerschnitzel is authentic and wonderful with the paprika sauce !
mine are 4 and 5 and hardly eat anything , but i paid $ 7.99 for each of them .
bad time all around .
exceptional food combined with a relaxed atmosphere fosters an environment reminiscent of being at home with friends .
giving them two stars just coz the interior is sort of cute .
great fish at a reasonable price .
not to mention their logo is super hip .
the servers wear clean white uniforms but are tatted up with hipster hair and gauged ears , this is a weird but charming place to be .
for 9 $ i 'd expect to be full .
the scallop salad was yummy . scallops were cooked perfectly .
it does make me a little sad that they do n't deliver .
it 's great for going on a date , the vibe is totally romantic and what says romance more than some delicious italian food ?
straight sunlight only is not how to light a bar .
also this place is pretty expensive .
the key is to get there before noon so you can find a table in the shade outside . fantastic scenery to watch while you crush the fresh sandwich .
the service was very poor . the server was rude and inattentive .
i am so happy i stumbled upon this place driving in the area to visit an aquarium haha .
the lunch special seems to be reasonably priced .
really fresh , clearly good ingredients , and prepared right . good atmosphere too .
the meat has a lack of flavour to it , the poutine gravy is bland , the fries plain .
the steak tips app is a better choice and was a good value for the price of about $ 7 .
zinfandel was very reasonably priced , but average quality .
i would recommend the blueberry as well as the original mojitos .
staff is attentive and friendly so that 's always something to look forward to .
it was so good . even though the curry was runny , it tasted amazing .
the cold cut is even cheaper for $ 2.50 .
aside from the servers obstructed view , she was pretty nice .
they have poor service and not so good food . you will always wait for 15-20 mins even if you see empty tables .
the glasses are made out of cut glass beer bottles which could be cool but mine was cracked around the rim which was dangerous .
we had the ultimate shrimp roll which was outstanding , as were all of our bowls .
prices are very high for what you get but what can you expect on the strip .
not impressed and would not recommend this to anyone .
this place was really good !
i got the cajon lobster roll , expensive at $ 19 dollars + you can add fries and a drink so $ 4 bucks more so $ 25 dollars for a complete meal with cold slaw .
the waffle was crispy and buttery , absolutely divine .
we ordered bean dip , but only took one bite because it was so bad .
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
i have never met a more rude manager of a restaurant .
do not come here doing meal times ( lunch and dinner ) , they will either forget ringing up your order and you 'll end up waiting for 30 minutes or they 'll serve it right away to you ... cold .
one employee just ruined it for me at the location for good .
the crispy chicken is ok , nothing spectacular , the white meat is on the dry side ; dark meat is good .
this restaurant is perfect for the neighborhood - busy professionals looking for somewhat healthy and quick lunch .
lots of cherry filling , and just the perfect amount of sweet for the morning .
the beers were ok , nothing special .
i loved loved the ambiance of the restaurant ! the atmosphere is cool , hip , and swanky with the modern asian decor .
it 's a little awkward .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
2 entrees and an appetizer for only $ 20 you can not beat it !
the decor is a bit weird for the ambiance of the restaurant , i guess its a talking piece .
great selection of unique pizzas .
the decor was extremely tacky but it allowed the food to be the real star .
$ 9 for a duvel is a bit high for me .
4 years ago this place was amazing !
one , like i would answer that honestly without my food already in hand .
it smells horrible , your shoes stick to the ground , there 's broken glass everywhere that they do n't clean up , it 's wall to wall people : so basically a huge fire hazard .
finally , they do n't take reservations till an hour before you eat .
i love the ambient and the environment there though .
supposed to be 24/7 but almost every time i call to order late they never answer to take my order . if i was the owner or gm i 'd be concerned over the lost revenue , are n't people being paid to keep the doors open and answer the phone .
yes , the prices are a little on the expensive side but usually healthy food is n't ever cheap .
the drinks were delicious and they have an excellent selection of liquor and beer .
the prices are reasonable .
the ugly : the food .
and they have a great wine and drink list .
beer was cold but all the mixed drinks had almost no alcohol .
especially the espresso martini which was mind blowing .
this place is pretty nice and big on the inside .
they barely had any beers on tap , had no jack daniels , but did make a pretty good moscow mule .
some of the food we got were the wings ( delicious ) the thin crust pepperoni ( for the kids ) also delicious !
tried one of their $ 9 individual pizzas here for lunch today , which is about $ 5 more than i would be willing to pay now that i know what they 're like .
a dollar a topping is ridiculous .
i really like this hotel the rooms are decent and clean . all the employees are nice except the guy the works at the entrance of the pool and the stupid rules about brining drinks into the pool from outside the hotel i had to chug mine just so i could sit near the pool .
teriyaki sauce was totally weak and tasteless .
atmosphere perfect , staff perfect , music perfect . and above all the food was perfect .
the prices are great as i got all that food for $ 7.95 .
at $ 3.25 for one and $ 2.95 for the other , in a nutshell , no they were n't a very good buy .
the bread is fresh , the toppings on the tortas are amazingly flavorful , and the salsa options are delicious .
it was very bland and our meat dishes were served lukewarm which i find a major turnoff when eating out .
good not great . the sandwiches are mediocre at best , but the antipasto app is great .
it 's pretty awesome that they even have small private table areas and rooms .
the sushi was lame . edible , but the pieces of fish were small , quality of fish was average , rice was mediocre and construction and presentation also mediocre .
drinks & beverages were very good as well .
on top of that their potato salad and tofu soup is delicious .
their flavors are incredibly unique and absolutely delicious . my absolute favorite was the strawberry cheesecake and the goat cheese strawberry balsamic .
fries were ok , but over salted . not cheap .
unfortunately the red wine on tap was chilled which dulled the taste . the chardonnay on tap was better but tasted weak .
however , the food was not hot , the bacon was undercooked and the potatoes were way overcooked .
outstanding selection of steaks , wines and martinis . great service .
the paneer was nice and tender . the channa masala had the right amount of spice and was delicious .
i only wished that the chicken was less on the dry side but the overall taste of the pizza makes up for that .
no complaints on not having a full glass of beer .
boy ... it was almost like a school cafeteria with no privacy , extremely bright lights , and weird layout .
i had a terrible experience there .
the prices are fair as well .
automatically noticed how clean the place it and the workers are super friendly and well groomed .
they also have a lot of no sushi food for you haters : - ) the atmosphere is very cool , i love the fishing rod looking chandelier in the middle of the place .
definitely highly recommended . you check this place out .
a special note about the house dj .
it should never be that difficult to pay .
i greatly appreciate a restaurant that makes soups , salad dressings and sauces from scratch as they do at sara 's .
for a salad you pay over $ 9.00 for , which is crazy .
the chefs took over 20 minutes to get our salads out and so the waiter apologized and then comped us a dessert which was delicious .
they have a full bar , a nice draft list , and an array of bottled and canned beers .
food and drinks were great . awesome happy hour prices .
food is good and priced reasonable .
i could n't help but notice the beautiful metallic paint on the walls .
all the rooms and suites with little living rooms which is a far better option than paying $ 20- $ 40 less and having a horrible room at one of the older hotels .
i leave hungry but at least $ 10 poorer . not cool !
a goodly choice of vodka , to my surprise .
the actual restaurant was creepy .
we loved our food and the service .
i ordered the prime rib medium rare , but was served an end piece dipped in au jus that was very over cooked and unevenly cut and difficult to chew . my partner ordered a 16 oz ribeye that was over cooked , very thin , and awful in colour .
the soda menu is enormous . they have a great menu with lots of comfort foods along with great vegetarian choices .
we only do wine and beer at the bar . ''
all in all this is a very poorly run establishment , which i blame on management for not having enough wait staff onsite during the busy hours , and also for not making sure that the hostesses and buffet workers communicate politely and effectively to the customers .
but the food left a lot to be desired : 3 smallish pieces of bacon which were really over cooked . the eggs were to be cooked over easy but they def missed the mark .
the soup was smooth and velvety and the noodles had great texture .
their lunch prices are quite high .
it 's fairly priced , but the quality is somewhat subpar depending on what you get .
food was creative and enjoyable . would also be a lovely spot to sip wine and appetizers .
he charged $ 10 for the rice , and $ 12 for two stews ( not a full serving just about a cup ) so $ 34 for an appetizer , super shady .
did n't try their cakes , but their pastry was just okay . nothing special but somewhat pricey .
the wait staff very attentive and friendly .
price tag too high for the food offerings .
if you are a person that appreciates these elements you wo n't be disappointed . be warned the cocktails are about 15 bucks a pop because it 's premium liquor .
they have a full bar with beers on tap with no drink or beer menu ?
great place and the service was exceptional i would definitely refer this place to anyone !
all of the drinks here are strong and delicious .
we were there for over 2 hours not by our own choice .
i could n't even finish my meal , since some of the orange chicken was hard .
talked to the owner who was very rude and said that it 's only at the bar .
i 'm no decor expert by any means , but i did n't care for the fake plants and the furniture was lawn chairs .
the price is decent here .
the whole set up is kind of awkward .
the decor was miserable and gaudy .
the place is quite large and open with nice decor and clean .
we were headed out of town and looking to get a great dinner before hitting the road . grimaldi 's and bandera both had an hour wait so we decided to stop into ra .
and if you love korean , their bibimbap is truly stunning ! served in a true sizzling bowl .
especially the night shift staff .
the bad : old furniture , plates , glasses , decor and horrible paint job .
the service was awesome even though we were the only people sitting outside i had just assumed they would forget about us , but instead they actually checked on us more often .
i can be a bit critical of spring rolls , but theirs ' are absolutely perfect .
the roasted corn was delicious and the other barbecued meats ( chicken , baby backs and beef ribs ) were simply the best .
still paid full price for the pizza .
i would have to say the service was poor .
needless to say , placing orders and receiving drinks was slow .
loud ass hell , laughing off the top of their lungs , and just hanging out in large numbers blocking walkways .
if you like spicy , the spicy tuna is spicy and the 911 roll is hot !
the prices are really great for lunch too .
they also served a very fragrant tea that was absolutely wonderful to drink .
once we ordered it took around 45 min to get our food which was odd because there were only 8 patrons and 4 already had their food .
the alcohol list was a real disappointment as they only had a few reds by the glass affordable and 1 rose .
we only had appetizers but entrees look good.. not a lot of beers on tap but the ones they had were craft beers and were decent choices .
the patio is mostly shaded under lots of big patio umbrellas so it stays pretty cool .
finally the manager came and he acted like this was the first time he heard about it , beyond rude .
the patio has picnic tables , so it gets very uncomfortable .
cash only . that sucks .
turns out it is any two they want you to have . could not get it as there is absolutely no changes or substitutions .
we went for valentine 's day dinner & walked out after paying $ 174 bill for 2 dinners ( $ 65 x 2 ) , 2 glasses of wine & 2 bottles of perrier . it was meh & that 's sad to say after spending that kind of money .
on game nights it gets a little loud with the all the excitement ! the food portions were perfect , and well presented
this place is easily my favorite spot to grab lunch or dinner .
the bathroom hallway seemed a but spooky , but not too bad .
i would have liked to order a dessert but there was nothing even remotely low in calories lol .
our server was really nice and polite .
ordered a large omg signature with chicken , garlic potatoes , and hot sauce on the side .
also , has a fully redone bar upstairs with plenty of screens throughout the entire place you will never miss out on whatever live ( mostly sporting ) event that is being aired !
it 's filled with a bunch of modern lighting and furniture , if you 're into that sort of thing .
i would rate this place lower because it was absolutely awful service but the food is just too good to give it that bad of a review .
+ loved the long list of wines by the glass .
the decor was a little weird though . very colorful , but the themes do n't match up .
quick and friendly service . good value for your dollar and they serve beer !
no spices , no flavor , no good .
the atmosphere is just plain stupid and tacky .
the only part that i found really annoying is asking 3 times for the check and waiting several minutes after our plates were cleared .
great to have a ton of additional offerings , and wine and beer beverages were included with the price !
disappointing all around . beer was ho-hum .
we also each had a whiskey sour . they were so delicious with the peach liquor .
and that slice of pie was amazing .
forget the name , but there was one made with whiskey , mint , simple syrup and a fruit ( like blackberries ) that was very good .
the price of the special for 2 is also $ 10 more then it used to be .
only complaint is we wished they had beers on tap , though they had a decent bottle selection .
keep up the good work , simi 's cafe , diane , and team .
it 's an awful piercing fluorescent white light that makes you uncomfortable .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
the bun was too big , and while i ordered it with mushrooms , there were only 3 or 4 buried under the cheese .
i 'm in salad heaven and also the lean sweet potato was so delicious as well .
only complaint was on how long it took to get the check
but the worst was the chicken bun .
everything we ordered was delicious , plus the prices are reasonable . there 's a european flair to everything , along with books hanging from the ceiling as decoration .
prices are reasonable as well .
decor is bad though lol
the lunch portions are pretty generous for the low cost !
ok quality meat but no taste with sauces . the fish was good but they just use salt and pepper for seasoning .
has two patios and one is dog friendly . inside is awesome feels like i could really watch the tourney there all week .
while we waited very briefly for a table , we had drinks at the bar and were all impressed with the unique martini and specialty drink selection .
happy hour specials , both drinks and food , were real bargains .
it 's a little but expensive but the quality of the food is higher than average .
it was rather bland and starchy . i ca n't say it was tasty at all , quite frankly .
the pork was dry but dripping with the au jus it sits in waiting to be used .
with a bottle of wine , i think 300 dollars per person ( tax and tip included ) is certainly a good deal : )
the prices are very reasonable .
we started out with sangria and a glass of wine both of which were great but it was downhill from there .
do n't get me wrong , i know its tough to work in food service but being rude will just make it worse . i 've experienced snarky comments and annoyed sighs , sad because we love a good blizzard .
when we tried to order drinks , the were out of the only draft beer , negro modelo ... and 3-4 of the bottle beers , and my 1st tequila choice ... then the bartender actually told me the hefeweizen bottle beer was `` just '' like the 2x ipa they were out of ... .really ?
all in all a great quick dinner under $ 25 for 2 of us .
i enjoyed how you could not see the rest of the restaurant except through some patterned walls .
another bummer was that they only service wine and beer , but lacked a strong list of either .
the meals are already $ 11- $ 15 and to pay another $ 5 for rice is outrageous .
the price is reasonable .
sitting at this restaurant right now , been here 45 minutes and my drink has been empty the majority of that time .
he has a nice selection of beers and we started with sapporo .
we sampled a few champagne cocktails -- each flavorful and delicious .
i got into maggiano 's from when i lived in the chicago area ( their location downtown there ) , and i 'm glad they have one here .
another plus side ? it 's only $ 5.49 without the egg and an extra dollar for the addition .
the lady up front is not only rude but very very lazy .
the manager was extremely impolite and hesitant to apologize .
it was light yet so flavorful .
i should have gone with wine since bad wine is better than pbr , coors light , or the m pilsner style ( not real pilsner ) beer that the server knew nothing about .
the food is pretty decent quality , especially considering it is totally cheap !
i booked on open table a 9:30pm reservation for 5. we arrived at 9:20pm to check in and were told very rudely that there would be at least an hour wait . they could seat us at 10:30. i showed her our confirmed open table reservation and she said `` we do n't honor open table reservations . ''
the prices are very reasonable too .
found a deal on hotels.com for just over $ 300 for 2 nights ... grabbed it and feel very happy with the hotel at this price .
the atmosphere is cool , but that 's about as good as this place gets .
they were made with the perfect amount of cinnamon and glaze .
i think it needs more lighting of some kind .
90 % of the time , the meat comes out piping hot , which are all delicious .
i love all the options . the seasonal menus are great .
very unique , flavorful and a nice change from the usual pizza , burgers and salads .
good selection of beer and helpful bartender . unfortunately , they 'd just tapped out 2 of the 3 beers we chose .
they have raised their prices and i just paid $ 16 for mac and cheese . that is just ridiculous .
dinner was $ 55 and wine $ 25 -- it was certainly very reasonable for the quality and the quantity .
cocktail of choice for the evening was the persian and it was light and refreshing .
the bartender was terrific i started with the smoke & ginger cocktail .
good meat does not need salt .
lost of different beers on tap and even more in the bottle for you beer drinkers .
the wine list is excellent .
great if you like waiting for 35 minutes , after calling half hour ago . annoying as hell .
nice atmosphere , music a bit loud .
the ipa 's were all smooth and tasty with a high alcohol content .
coffee is really great and only $ 0.50 ! chloe 's prices are reasonable across the board , especially for kierland .
prices are not cheap , but in my opinion very reasonable .
the food took forever and was not warm when it came out .
not hating , not loving but just plain ok .
best food in town great atmosphere owners are wonderful people of going there .
all of their drinks are refreshing and secretly strong ... which is my favorite .
the service is also nice and friendly .
the decor is tacky but thats what i love about this place .
our waiter was very attentive , and pleasant , exchanging jokes with us through out the evening .
the sandwiches were a generous size and all three were very good ( meatball , garlic peppercorn steak and reuben ) .
on the `` salame '' pizza i ordered , the meat was much more spicy and unique tasting than a typical pepperoni pizza .
fast , friendly , prompt service .
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
they have an excellent collection of drinks too .
just wonderful . we 're excited to go back and experience more of their delicious food .
great beers , bartenders do n't know anything about the beers . the menu is ok. not bad to pair beer with .
nothing truly had a lot of flavor . it was all kind of bland and dull .
one time ordered extra chicken and veggies and that 's when i got sick .
prices are very reasonable .
the place has limited seating but the atmosphere was great , especially since they were playing great 90 's hip hop music .
the beer was fine , and if i had known the dos equis was only 3 dollars a bottle i would have stuck with that rather than the negra modelo .
only thing i did n't like about the room and the hallway was the decor .
prices on food are decent .
5. outdoor seating 6. strong drinks for $ 5 - yeah i know i said that twice my favorites are the pain killer and the blood orange martini .
the two items i ordered , kung pao chicken and chicken lo mein were both bland , lacked chicken , and the chicken was obviously from a can ( it tasted like rubber ) .
it 's a good thing that i 'm always on yelp because thanks to yelp , i found out that there are two locations in this great city - planet hollywood and the palms .
i also love filipino garlic rice and that was great too .
i had a dragon roll and it was pretty good , great presentation .
i did n't like the enchilada because of the horrible thick mole sauce .
did a late night dinner here on a business trip .
reasonable prices on their drinks .
the dressing was a bit overwhelming and it was missing the crunch of the skin i was hoping for .
the meat was tough and very stringy .
the hot relish is especially awesome .
pricing is reasonable and service was good .
nothing on the menu seemed to be `` great '' to me .
do n't expect a lavish layout lol .
pricing was reasonable for `` strip '' fine dinning however .
to top it off no draft beer in the theater only the bar ?
terrible service . two people serve the whole restaurant , and if you complaint about how they keep ignoring you , they would just tell you to eat somewhere else .
they also have an extensive wine list that is n't too rude $ $ $ wise !
plus , it 's right across the entrance to marquee .
say at the bar with one of my coworkers on our last trip , and it was perry delightful .
i had a taco trio with a side of street corn off the cobb and everything was delicious ! for my drink i tried the blushing senorita - wine with raspberry stoli and berries - divine !
the only negative aspect was the loud atmosphere due to a lack of music : i could hear the entire conversations from the table behind me and the one beside me .
$ 50 corkage fee , only if they do n't have the wine you 've brought on their menu .
the drinks were pretty cheap ( wine , beer , margs ) but i do n't think they had any coors or bud on tap , which is unusual .
for comparison , the wicked spoon is about $ 5 more for each adult , but kids only cost 1/3 .
the ketchup was made in house but tasted weird and sort of grainy .
i did n't drink but i saw a good selection of their beer and a beer sampler that looked interesting .
i had the tequila lemonade -really liked .
the toro was a bit tough to eat , stringy like , but the yellowtail belly made up for what the toro was n't .
enjoyed their specialty burger and the heavenly mac and cheese , and the bread pudding ! great service .
we also had their fish cakes which were super , super good .
the famous chilli was n't that good i was sick the rest of the day .
the shops are really cool .
fast and efficient , every time i go here it 's always a great experience . i enjoy the customer service enjoy their smiles .
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
i thought the sliced ham was just okay with a rather tough skin on it .
and ask me 20 % tips right in front my face when they gave me the bill .
the prices are just right .
the two employees i dealt with were extremely unfriendly and rude .
even though we did ask the employees here at this restaurant whether it would count , and they said it would - lame !
it took us ages to get a server to take our order , food was just ok. my mother-in-law 's main was cold .
so pretty much the reason for this 2 star here is because the waiter came to our table as we were paying the bill and said to us we did n't tip yet .
our visit started with a very knowledgeable bar tender who recommended a great bottle of wine .
the decor is very dated and the cleanliness leaves something to be desired . our room was relatively clean if you disregard the weird stains on the curtains .
good sized portions , and the service was friendly . kimchi and boiled peanuts were yummy !
service was quick & everyone was very nice .
the gimmick is cute , the food is filling and decently priced .
with thirty some craft beers and wines on tap , beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender .
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
i ca n't say the lady that took my order was rude , but she just seemed to have no patience as i chose my order .
the wine choices are great .
sis had a hard iced tea and proclaimed it perfect - i had a soft lemonade and was happy , too .
the beers were ok , nothing special .
imagine not having to leave north las vegas to find something classy .
the happy hour is amazing , the quality of the sushi is pretty damn good and i love the rolls .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
when he told her we did n't have it yet she said responded by pretty much saying she 's not a mind reader and she had no clue what we had . rude !
i know it 's the kids meal but could it at least be 4 wings instead these sad 3 ? flavor was okay , had the medium buffalo tasted more mild .
not sure if it was an employee or a patron she was talking to but it was not good customer service .
very expensive $ 18 with a coke wo n't be going back . lamanna 's excellent hot food and you get a lot more for less .
the servers were so nice !
the selection of draft beers looked o.k . nothing outstanding but their bottle selection sucked .
plus the prices were very fair .
an awesome concept with amazing sushi at such great value . there is a variety of sushi , appetizers , and desserts on the conveyor belt .
i loved the murals and style of the place .
the steak was perfectly cooked , juicy and great favor with fresh french fries .
drinks are decent price . food is excellent and you get nice portions for the cost .
we started out with some happy hour priced drinks .
great flavor , horseradish dipping sauce was a tasty addition .
so awesome ! must try and definitely recommended to families and everyone else !
it 's always a delight to see them putting on a quick show and taking advantage of the gorgeous scenery and clear chandler skies .
a great choice for happy hour apps snd cocktails at the bar .
that 's cool - unless you write `` freaky fast '' all over your walls ; - )
was not fresh , not crisp and not a refreshing balance to the fried egg roll .
had nachos which were surprisingly meh . bar tap choice was kind of limited , and they did n't have all on tap .
great place to go for breakfast , i 've eaten here 5 or 6 times since june 2014 , the food is always delicious .
the price is very reasonable .
great food decent prices .
the interior was a different story .
no hot water or paper towels , dirty , and down a sketchy hallway .
sit at the counter to have a great view on the kitchen teamwork !
food and drinks are great , pricing is reasonable as well .
the steak fajita meat was full of gristle and i had to spit out every piece i tried to chew .
only complain i have is that the lighting is really weird .
live conga band covering great music from the 80s tonight ( friday ) .
i do n't drink but they had a huge selection of wine and beer .
with thirty some craft beers and wines on tap , beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender .
i hate seeing miserable restaurant staff that move slowly and look like they hate their job .
enjoyed some bread and a nice glass of malbec while waiting on my order .
the orange beef and peanut butter chicken are both excellent .
i only had beer .
it 's a cool place to hangout with your friends , though i remember some things on the menu being a little pricey .
that was pretty good . the other kid and i had the pepper beef which was really oily and i thought the menu said spicy but it was n't .
however they offer a happy hour on well drinks and draft beers but their draft beer wasnt working and they dont offer bottles in substitution so that was kind of disappointing .
expressionless ... service was okay but man , you could see she either had a bad day or that she hated her job .
i 'm so glad that i listened !
the noodles were perfect for this type of dish .
enchiladas flavors were ok , but the food was just barely warm .
you do n't charge $ 16 for very little , bland tasting crawfish !
they have a great wine and scotch list .
drinks are more than reasonably priced ( almost cheap ! )
the prices are decent .
great service and excellent variety of food options to choose from .
the kiwi sangria is a fabulous ( 5 stars ) , very refreshing and not too sweet for a hot phoenix day .
the restaurant had only pepsi , house wine and corona to drink .
the biggest kicker for me is it is relatively expensive for the underwhelming food .
just inside the door is a cart of games that can be taken to the tables for play while enjoying food or drink .
my favorite dish from our last visit was the chili sea bass .
the prices are also reasonable .
it was a nice relaxing meal , and i enjoyed the atmosphere and leisurely pace of the meal .
excited to check out brunch here too !
the prices are great too .
not sure what kind of customer service this is , but not for me .
this restaurant is located inside the rear of a hotel on the popular fremont street experience .
a few of the servers are great but some need to find a new line of work ... for having been a huge chompie 's fan for the past 15 years i ca n't say this location is living up to my expectations of the chompie 's i have known and loved .
go for the view but be prepared to pay a high price for it and do n't have too high of expectations for the food .
this place is really cute inside and the outside area is a lil nice spot when the weather is good .
despite the food quality , the atmosphere is not bad for a drink or 2 , but for the price you pay , you could have better options .
i 've been here here twice so far ; first time i took my desserts to go since the place was so busy .
i know everything in vegas is more expensive but geeze , it 's like $ 18+ for everything including small sides ... for food that was only mediocre .
the tortillas were stale and reheated but sadly were still hard .
the staff was so accommodating that they allowed me to pay $ 12 for my burger and add the special soup for $ 5 .
i have pretty high standards when it comes to steaks and when i 'm going to a `` good steakhouse '' and paying 50+ dollars a la carte i expect a certain level of deliciousness !
prices are very reasonable .
took an hour and forty five minutes for delivery and when they finally got close they called to ask for a gate code that was written in on the order .
for $ 40 a person , there are far better options .
delicious meat with garlic sauce and the rice was cooked perfectly .
the service was excellent and staff was very friendly .
i honestly do n't know why i expected more from this place , i loved the interior design and lighting but the food did not satisfy me at all .
when i first walked into grampa 's i was surprised at how cozy and romantic the place is .
my only complaint is the noodles were cooked unevenly and some parts were not transparent yet and difficult to chew .
that was dirty and the bathrooms were scary dark .
i was seated right away because there wasnt a lot of customers .
- sweet potato fries : these were also delicious , but nothing too unique . the honey jalapeno mayo was a good dip paired with the sweetness of the fries .
but , as several have commented it 's bland and even worse , they have a most bitter tomato sauce . to boot , i ordered a side of spaghetti , cooked perfectly al dente and then as you taste it , the same bitter almost inedible tomato sauce .
it 's easy to be snobby about dennys , but you know what ? this is better than 80 % of breakfasts on the strip , and it 'll cost you $ 7 .
dinner is more high end and expensive .
the food is ok , like i said , for a groupon deal of $ 18 it 's not bad , but would i pay more for this place , no way . i think it 's $ 24 for lunch w/o the groupon .
pasta is always perfect and hot .
i think everyone at our table had either wine or beer ( they have an ok beer selection , but nothing fancy , and only bottles ) .
prices are very reasonable as well .
thought the bagels were not good . family liked them but i tried the place a few times and thought they were tasteless .
great food and drinks . everything tastes very fresh !
dark awkward feeling in there .
lastly , their brewed mango iced tea is refreshing and a great compliment to any meal .
fairly overly priced for the place .
good food and decent prices !
mistakingly ordered from the wrong location . they called over to confirm the order and then made it for me very quickly at their location .
the broth at linh is quite thick and delicious , though the beef happens to be a bit thick and overcooked compared to what i 'm used to .
i love this place but hate hate hate the crappie scribbled on walls for decor ... .
they do have a full bar but no beer on tap .
we were also impressed by a bottle of a tuscan wine that we ordered .
their prices are very good .
breakfast for two came to about $ 40 - this is my only complaint .
the beer was cold and in a pint glass .
the brisket was so dry , and flavorless , it was pretty much inedible .
the room was clean and the bed was comfortable . the ac in the room worked well and had the room nice and chilly .
4. the entire place was out of all draft beer except some shitty orange something .
the wait staff is very attentive .
this place is dimly lit , but not to the extreme where you can not read the menu without your server pulling out a pen light .
oh this meal was memorable not only for the food but for the fact that for two people we paid only 22 bucks .
beer selection was ok , food was ok , service was ok ( one of the draft beers the server was unsure of , i think there were only 4 on the list .
the lighting was a little dim so it was hard to read the menu .
ultimately , i would n't recommend this place but it does have potential to improve .
nestled in the heart of sin city 's `` chinatown ; '' this place is a gem of qualify chinese food with an authentic atmosphere that keeps you feeling welcome even after you leave .
we got there at a good time and our food came out about 15 min .
the place is attractive , but neither upscale nor particularly intimate though we required a flashlight to read the menus .
the food here is ridiculously cheap . the quality is pretty decent but some stuff ( i.e .
the menu looked good , we thought the beer selection was good , especially having 12 draft beers .
we sat there for a good 90 minutes and never once did he come to our table to see how the food or the service was .
i think i like it the most because of mascot , the atmosphere , bright colors and that 's where i get my pencils !
dinner specials are nothing special ! they are pretty expensive and the portions are not anything better than the lunch sizes .
the chocolate fountain is absolutely beautiful and will have you staring at it for a good few minutes .
good prices and pretty good taste . lunch specials are filling .
not sure if i would pay full price for this place .
i went to victor in hopes of having a delicious meal for my friend 's birthday .
they have outdoor seating but there was bird poop on all the seats and the birds fly everywhere while you eat .
i purchased a 12 inch marguerita pizza and a 20 oz soda for 13 bucks , which is higher than normal but not a bad price for airport food .
beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor . or at least the menu was .
prices are good and a good value too .
i was impressed with the layout of the bar .
i am very happy about this place as the price for me in a group of 6 was only about $ 25 usd dollars .
the vibe up top is very unique and is best explained by looking at photos .
they start with a basket of papadum and various dipping sauces and it 's amazing !
the aesthetics here are somewhat hard to describe , though the numerous yelp photos of the interior pretty much paint an accurate picture .
their set course meal is the most reasonable .
one thing i found weird was that the lighting was too bright for a restaurant .
the decorations and adorable .
somewhat expensive , but not outrageous .
tap water there is terrible but is kind of necessary when drinking cocktails .
the busser kid came to clean our table and just stood there staring instead of asking for our plates .
the only thing i wish was that the sauce was a bit less thick .
fresh , good quality , and cheap .
will definitely be back for some delicious ramen and great conversation with the owner .
i really enjoyed the peanut sauce that accompanied the chicken skewers . also with it came cucumbers and onions in a sweet chili sauce , which was delightful .
i could n't help but notice the beautiful metallic paint on the walls .
good service , reasonable prices .
small place but cozy .
also extremely overpriced at about $ 40 per person .
the margarita started strong but got a very different drink the second time around .
rooms , the original tower has not changed at all in the last 15 years . but for $ 30.00 a night with 2 free nights , i guess i ca n't complain .
decent food but wildly overpriced for the quantity .
even though i was not drinking this time , i could not help but notice the excellent selection of draft beers .
meats and sides are delicious .
beer was served in ice frozen glasses , nice touch , warm sake was good .
however , no beer menu . weird .
food was great , service was beyond slow . took 45 mins to get entrée and the place was dead .
we were pretty impressed with the wine list .
place was clean except the men 's washroom ... the ceiling was leaking and water was dripping everywhere .
the price was reasonable too .
i got my beer and i ordered dos equis but they brought another kind , but beer was beer and need beer in me .
i took a look at the beer list and was pretty impressed , as they had at least fifteen different beers on tap , plus i think that they had a bottled beer list as well .
and its only $ 5.00 .
i love this place ! there is always something great on tap and the food has been amazing on many visits !
charging for sparkling water makes sense but not for tab water ( i 'm actually a bit angry regarding that fact ) .
she actually asked in a rude tone `` are you happy now ? ''
absolutely delicious . really , fantastic flavors in a great combination .
the prices are also very reasonable .
even though i could n't taste any mushroom and noodle in the dish , i still loved it a lot and would definitely reorder this dish .
to justify the enormous portions , they charge high prices .
great and super friendly service and food made with love !
the pizza is a great hand tossed thickness and the wings are amazing .
our favorite is the banana bread , prime rib benny and their kids meals .
however they offer a happy hour on well drinks and draft beers but their draft beer wasnt working and they dont offer bottles in substitution so that was kind of disappointing .
these burgers are juicy , cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth . burgers never tasted better & service was amazing !
although they are cheap , they 're nothing special .
highly recommend and will definitely be returning !
cool decor and relaxed atmosphere .
total bill was $ 32 which was a bit high , but good food .
i did n't try the beer , but it looked like decent alcohol choices .
i did not ask for any special tequila .
the only redeeming quality of this place is the kids might like it but is it worth paying the obscene prices for crappy food ? probably not .
most of them are $ 6.50 , and they 're the perfect size .
that is very disappointing . when i worked in food service we would have gladly refunded and then redid the order with the senior discount applied .
prices are very reasonable .
i scanned the menu and wow the prices were outrageously high like toro was 26 $ , halibut was 18 $ , saki by the glass nigori super $ $ $ and it was a small glass .
i also had the chai tea which was given to me as a sample , tasty but even better `` dirty '' = with espresso shots !
the place has a dark , classy and rustic feel to it and i think the name willow fits it perfectly .
bathroom was pretty nice but it was a bit `` dirty '' ( overfilled trash baskets and stuff on floor ) .
the drinks were n't `` weak '' !
the decor was super outdated and dirty looking though , and the furniture was showing obvious signs of wear .
the employees are very friendly and helpful .
neither my wife or i could finish the fish ... too dry and `` fishy '' tasting .
to top it off no draft beer in the theater only the bar ?
this is a cute little place with a slightly hip vibe .
spent $ 32 for 16 pieces of chicken tenders that were not only small , but tasted like it was a product of frozen food and undercooked .
it 's sort of gothic and kind of trendy , but mainly just weird .
everything was homemade and delicious . order to share , the homemade nutella and jams were delicious .
the pizza did n't taste as good as it sounded .
great atmosphere , especially for lunch when it 's not packed , and cheap prices for the quality .
the beer selection was pretty poor so i ended up with a whiskey cocktail instead .
i did n't drink but the bottles and canned beer , as well as the wine , selection looked nice as well .
the sangria had a lot of yummy fruit and got me feelin ' good because i started drinking on an empty stomach .
i think they are ok , but a little pricey . if you get the bowl , its pretty cheap for a healthy lunch .
the beers we ok nothing special .
- price - ca n't beat $ 10 for lunch , especially this much good sushi .
prices are reasonable and the quantity given is also good .
everything was well seasoned and delicious .
i know exactly why my waitress sat us so far away from everyone else .
the total of my meal was seven dollars and fifty cents , a reasonable price .
i wanted a mimosa but she recommended a different version of this popular drink that a regular customer made up ... orange juice , cranberry juice , champagne and a shot of vodka .
the $ 8.99 meal was a good value ... 6 wings , basket of fries and 20 oz drink .
it was ok. i 've had better tacos downtown . the meat was dry .
the price was reasonable .
however , the beer was good . they poured a good beer .
only the paid lounge chairs have an umbrella and they cost around $ 150 for the day .
rooms were clean but possibly appeared that way because of the dim lighting .
nice place and totally worth checking out .
this place is really good , and fairly priced .
the food was nothing extraordinary and the lobster did n't seem like it was fully cooked .
i did n't see one decent beer on tap or in the coolers .
lets not forget the decoration that is ugly as well .
i got a beer sampler and a couple of the beers were ok , but nothing really impressive .
another positive point is the service .
a bit of a pain for bathroom and bar ( long lines ) . decor and lights were bad ass
was $ 8.99 , so not a bad deal .
the rest of our table ordered about 15 minutes after us , yet all 6 of them were served almost right away .
it was lovely to have this available right near the guest elevators .
the waiter was okay , what 's up with hiring fake , pretentious humans at restaurants ?
our server alan was great .
this is n't tacky , it looks good .
not a huge fan of frosty glasses for craft beer , but it was n't so bad that there was an iceberg floating in my beer or anything .
good drink selection ... bottled drinks , beer too i think ?
it did n't feel `` clean '' as another reviewer said and the bright lights just showcase every imperfection of the place .
their champagne cocktails looked delicious , but as much as i love champagne it does not love me , so i opted instead for the bouchon cocktail .
service was awesome , but it looks like they do n't have fried zucchini anymore .
i did receive a cup of salsa all over my pants from a server attempting to carry the tray , but after that the food was really good ( short rib ) . the manager did come by after the salsa spill and tell us he 'd bring margaritas , but i was a little surprised to see it charged on our bill .
i liked the wine .
this was fine as we came primarily for drinks , however when we spoke with the bartender , he told us that this was false and handed us menus to order food .
the green beans were a little bland but we 've been spoiled by our own mother 's cooking .
i love this place .
disappointing . beer was fine .
it was n't very crowded and even though the people who worked there are nice , it took them forever to make our mediocre sandwich .
beers were $ 1 at the bar which rules , and they had some sort of hefeweizen that tasted good to me .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
$ 14+ for any acceptable beer.. crazy .
really sexy , warm and fun environment ; it 's hard not to notice right away .
this place is awesome !
great bar to start the evening off with a cocktail .
it 's expensive , but you pay for what you get .
the store front was clean but the bathroom was nasty - poop on the toilet seat and no soap in the dispenser .
everyone working there is very friendly , looking forward to returning to try some more of the menu .
and no one came around during the entire meal to refill water .
it was nice and thin but not over sauced or cheesed .
absolutely delicious pizza . the employees are very friendly and helpful , willing to explain the menu and make suggestions if it 's your first time there .
i usually get a beer and as much as i enjoy a cold mug of beer i do wish i could get a cold pint glass of beer .
the whole place was really dirty - stains on the walls and the floors were disgusting .
also the prices are really reasonable .
we ordered fries too and they were served cold and soggy .
negative points for weird service and an even stranger ambiance in an old 50 's diner .
do not pay full price .
only wished heineken was on tap , does have bottle tho .
we usually go to obh on sundays after church and there is always somewhat of a wait because people have discovered what a wonderful place this is !
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
i admit , yes , the food is still good but it does n't warrant paying the increased prices .
it also has a roof top patio , which is were i usually sit on the hot summer nights .
they did a poor job of it too as there were at least five pieces of chicken still in it .
not a bad bar .
food was cooked perfect , waitress was very friendly and helpful .
the prime rib and bouillabaisse were excellent if a bit over salted , but most of the other meats were rather tough . the crepes and flan were very good , but the creme brulee was burnt ( and had only a paper-thin layer of sugar to caramelize ) and the other desserts were so-so .
great food , fast service , and cheap prices .
it is very clean with great service .
loved the salads , cheese assortment , and desserts including scoops of ice cream and homemade sorbets . juices and coffee are included as well .
im no pizza aficionado but this pizza was as good as any i 've had , the crust was great and so were the toppings .
lol . i 'll go back for sure .
fun and helpful customer service . awesome looking and tasting food .
the main lobster pasta was delicious !
the interior is clean and comfortable , if uninspired .
i had the worst bout with food poisoning of my entire life after eating here .
food is great and really cheap .
basically , it seemed like it was pizza ingredients baked upon a tortilla and the ricotta cheese atop the pizza was terrible . wayyy too much cheese .
a cozy and casual place in the ne .
other diners seemed happy with the pitchers of sangria and the finger food .
you should be served exceptional tappas for the prices they charge .
they serve cokes in little glass bottles which i thought was a nice touch .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
so disappointed ... . told waitress i had a really bad shellfish allergy 3 times only for her to bring me a plate of sashimi with shellfish ... .. worse part is that there was a hair in one of the sashimi pieces .
the venue was nice and our waitress was very helpful .
burritos are a good size for a good price ( under $ 5 ! )
crazy cheap prices for an amazing meal .
they give you a dry sandwich on a bun , and you squirt which ever sauces you choose . i find the hot bbq sauce is a divine mix of hot , sweet and tangy .
absolutely fantastic , creative and interesting food with awesome prices .
jumbo shrimp were dry like they sat out after being cooked . broccoli was over cooked .
environment is very cool .
the cost was right around $ 10 , if i remember correctly .
the place was pleasant , clean and tidy . the food was good and carlos , our server , carlos , was good , polite and courteous .
if you want to get full , you have to spend close to 80 $ per person .
you guys were so terrible with your service and no one was owning up to what happened .
we were a large group of over 20 and the waitress managed to give us great service .
food is bland and veggies seem like the were steamed in the microwave .
me being a beer drinker they had a decent selection .
everyone is very friendly and prompt service .
they only had a few beers on tap , and none that were particularly exciting .
it would have gained one more star if the service was n't so poor , but i think the poor service is attributed to one server , one experience .
lovely seating options with cushioned benches and decor that makes you feel like you are home enjoying a coffee in your living room .
amazing , amazing and amazing ! such good food here , i got the special surf and turf , filet mignon and lobster with baked potato and salad for 38 $ .
the chicken is tasty and they use homemade garlic sauce that adds a unique taste .
the only good part i saw was the selection of beer on tap .
visiting from ca . outstanding food and service !
the difference between the two , and the reason this one is more satisfying than five guys , is that the burger here costs $ 2.95 or less , while five guys is $ 5 or more .
when we went there was only 1 cook 1 bartender for 30 people .
if i could make a recommendation , it would be to implement a rewards system for loyal customers .
really glad we came here for lunch ! yummy !
kind but like all salesmen trying to get you to order tequila , drinks , ( at 11 am ) beer , margaritas , dessert ? anything ?
the cheeseburger is a very disappointing $ 18 experience , as is 7 unimpressive chicken wings for a $ 15 price tag .
great location and views of the strip were great .
could n't drink but beer menu looked awesome too .
i loved it , met the owner who was there and he was a delightful host .
and the prices were at the higher end of the reasonable range .
prices are very good .
i ordered the tamarind and it came in a huge glass .
great wine list , and the service was impeccable .
the prices are very reasonable .
$ 50+ for mediocre food and not so great service .
it certainly was not a problem for us as it was near sunset the view out the window was fairly breathtaking .
this was my first time staying on fremont and i have so say i was impressed .
love the happy hour and the bar .
on my most recent visit i popped in on a saturday afternoon for a bit of day drinking and received amazing service .
spring rolls are good except for the fact that the peanut sauce was too watery for my taste .
pretty decent taiwanese restaurant i had for dinner tonight . yeah dishes are tasty and pretty good portions servings .
1 ) the bloody mary bar is awesome . we sat at the regular bar and watched the bartender replenish their in house infused vodkas .
when we tried to order drinks , the were out of the only draft beer , negro modelo ... and 3-4 of the bottle beers , and my 1st tequila choice ... then the bartender actually told me the hefeweizen bottle beer was `` just '' like the 2x ipa they were out of ... .really ?
our service was excellent and pleasant .
they even had happy hour pricing at $ 5 a glass . we sat outside which really made for a nice experience .
it was perfectly cooked .
the food was ok. large portions , but the taste was just ok , nothing great .
i highly recommend the pastrami sandwich , the pretzel and cheese dip is so yum ! and the fried chicken .
horrible , ignorant experience .
sadly , we had to flag down a different waitress every time for her to direct our waitress to us .
when we tried to order drinks , the were out of the only draft beer , negro modelo ... and 3-4 of the bottle beers , and my 1st tequila choice ... then the bartender actually told me the hefeweizen bottle beer was `` just '' like the 2x ipa they were out of ... .really ?
it 's a good price , quick and pretty good .
their crust is thin and has the right amount of crunch and chew .
lunch slice special was par for the course , with 2 slices and drink for around $ 5 .
my husband liked the kamikaze roll the best . the himachi and jalapeño was great too .
if you want to stuff your face be prepared to pay around $ 35- $ 50 bucks easy .
the sausage and peppers made up for the bland beef in my soggy sandwich , while my wife 's croissant was nothing special .
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
i would n't classify it as traditional mexican food , but the food and service is always good and the chips and salsa are excellent !
as you ride up the glass elevator to the 64th floor atop thehotel at mandalay bay , anticipation sets in , as you await this unbelievable view everyone has been talking about .
cute little place , will gladly come back again .
the prices are more than reasonable .
the bathroom is n't necessarily dirty , but it is very rundown .
down side is we paid $ 26 dollars for such small portions . this is restaurant prices ... : (
it was a little creepy .
i got the crab cakes that still had shell in them the butter sauce was very rich , and everything that was fried seemed like they used the same batter .
the only reason that i did n't give it a 5 star is because the mark up of the wine is ridiculous and they should take a consideration charging $ 19.00 for a glass of wine that the bottle could be purchased for $ 17.99
as far as preference in n out is a better value for $ $ $ , paid $ 20 for two burgers and one fry .
i think she was 12. margaritas were hot and tasted like there was no tequila in it .
ridiculous . i know drinks are pricey in vegas but 30 bucks that 's crazy !
only disappointed by the tomato bisque - tasted unfortunately much like campbell 's .
i think the interior is ugly .
we also tried a cocktail that was light and refreshing .
the lunch `` special '' was 29 fucking dollars .
not bad , but overpriced for small portions .
my lasagna was decent but was n't any better than a $ 2 lasagna lean cuisine .
the bento box itself had a full sushi roll and did n't skimp on the hibachi steak or vegetables . the fried rice that came with it was also full of vegetables and was n't greasy .
it was so fun to watch and everyone is super nice .
the prices are unbelievably cheap .
if a manager is reading this , please act fast and hire people who are qualified .
all in all , disappointing .
food was n't bad but sure not going back for the service they provide .
the ambiance is charming .
showed her everything in the bag and asked if she felt stupid making it so difficult to get what i paid for .
it 's a lot of food for two people , at a reasonable price : 15.99 per person .
the prices are acceptable , not considerably cheap or expensive .
an excellent dessert drink , and i look forward to trying more of their specialty cocktails in the future .
this place is so good !
like , $ 300 dinner wrong .
i love wine and their flight deals were exquisite .
rose d and i ordered two venti drinks and they were ready absurdly quickly .
the lamb kebabs were delicious and the mixed shawarma plate could possibly feed an entire family .
i was quiet , no signs of being drunk .
the food is decent but rather over priced imo .
i was pretty excited to try out this place .
was also hoping there 's be a few pieces of carrot , onion or broccoli in the entrees but alas it was only fried chicken pieces sauced up .
very disappointing ! the fries are mushy , not well seasoned and the ketchup and mayonnaise they come with are mediocre .
the staff were awesome and very inviting .
however , service is terrible .
the drinks are good !
seemed that the margaritas were the specialty but was not impressed , plus it came in a beer pint glass.. ?
kind of pissed i spent 17 bucks for a medium pizza that has about 10 pieces of pepperoni and moderate cheese cover as well .
everything was fresh and delicious .
the rest of our party was also dissatisfied with their food.. one had beef sliders , so burnt and tough .
the celeriac was amazing and the cranberries were an excellent addition to sweeten the overall taste .
prices were very reasonable also .
so why are we tipping the waitress sure is n't for good service she did n't really do anything .
as a strong drink , it was good .
the food was delicious .
although i do n't drink beer , i was impressed by their incredible selection of beer on tap .
pretty dark , rugged , and maybe a little dirty ?
perfect balance of sweet and flavorful . creamy and crispy .
tomato broth is my favorite , but i also enjoyed the seafood and mushroom one .
i might try it again at some point to let them redeem themselves , but they need to have better quality control at such a reputable place .
he made sure that our experience was perfect .
oh yeah ; and i almost forgot if you 're going to use the restroom as a guy , the urinal is one giant cast-iron bathtub ... it 's hilarious : - )
great food or a great scenery ?
the place is pretty cheap too .
pizza was almost black on the bottom and the breadsticks were horrible .
the karaoke was packed . some amazing singers and some more ... performance than acoustic .
delicious , fairly priced lunch .
everything was freshly baked , lovingly prepared and we savored the delicate well made dainty goodies .
i am so glad i found this place .
pretty quick with the food . good amount for a fair price .
we had two apps , three entrees , and four drinks of their perfectly created drink menu .
i 've tried the mac and cheese with ham , the chicken pot pie , the fish tacos , as well as the fish sandwich .
my husband and i shared the bone in rib eye , which is my favorite steak . the side dishes , especially the potato gratin are amazing .
let 's see : bad lighting , uncomfortable sheets , water so hard if you use a wash cloth on your skin with it you could potentially tear the skin right off your body , an ac unit that just does n't work , terribly thin walls and you can see the light coming in from the hallway -- hope you 're not expecting privacy !
dry meat , mediocre sweet tea , 75 cents a slice for bread , run of the mill sauce , vinegar sauce that is just vinegar .
always a yummy meal ! my husband and i find this to be our go to place for a quick tasty , casual meal when in vegas .
we did order some margaritas and again they were n't bad just your typical margarita .
i love the interior and the comfortable seating they offer on the indoor/outdoor patio looks inviting .
pricing is pretty reasonable , or cheap relative to the strip .
thankfully the rest of the dinner service was good and entertaining so our evening was n't totally ruined but due to their poor service quality , i ca n't recommend this location to anyone .
our server recommended a fantastic bottle of wine after i indicated my taste and the tiramisu was to die for .
i strongly recommend this place : d
it 's as bad as the ones i ate in the cafeteria in the hospital i used to work in ; sorry for the insult ... it just tastes really weird ... i ca n't describe it .
i had a combo plate , beef and chicken .
the mint tea , served in traditional glass cups , was perfect .
the wine list is delicious .
we asked what was in the margaritas as in what kind of tequila and the bartender responded `` everything is tequila based like every margarita '' .
but to spend $ 50 on a meal that your not happy with is hard to swallow sometimes
only thing `` nola '' was tacky beads on the lighting .
could n't drink but beer menu looked awesome too .
we enjoyed the atmosphere of the quaint inside bar and the refreshing breeze from the outdoor patio .
not crazy about the decor though .
every time i break down to eat at this restaurant i 'm so disappointed .
price was reasonable as well .
( i love crab ! )
give me a wood chair , tacky thai paintings or sculptures any day , because i know i will be able to trust the food .
the pour was horrible and the beer was flat .
good : reasonable price .
the price is a little bit higher but not too expensive .
all in all the meal should have cost at most $ 10 assuming a very high 400 % markup .
i do n't drink beer , but my friends do and they said their beers were just ok , nothing spectacular .
the server was not at all friendly and at the start before ordering we asked if we could split the bill and was told yes . aside from refills on drinks we did n't see our server the entire time .
the only thing that i would have liked differently , was that there was too much sauce and it was poured on my steak .
the service was wonderful and very attentive ; staffs kept checking up on us and making sure everything was going well .
special chicken and rice is a classic go to , still amazing .
always a plus people noise level is upbeat and loud but music is fitting for environment , it 's not to the extent that it bothers you .
staff looked like they did n't want us there . they were rude , cold , and the one person who tried acting like they cared was n't doing a very good job at it .
we sat outside since the weather was beautiful , but they also have plenty of seating area inside .
it was a warm day but we still sat on the patio and it was perfect with the misters and shaded trees .
noodles were super super dry , gross . chicken and veggies were good .
no draft beer , but a decent choice of cans and bottles .
drinks are strong , cheap , and we 'll made .
very nice and clean !
the cocktails were also really good and not full of sweeteners .
the house chardonnay was exceptional but the beer was warm .
everything is extremely good . the prices you can not beat .
it has become one of my favorite places to grab a burger .
plus , they have some really creative cocktails at the bar -- the basil pear martini is lively and lovely -- thanks to christina for her recommendation on that !
the wait on a holiday was just over 30 minutes , not too bad .
my favorite dish here are the hong kong crispy noodles . the noodles are really good and they do n't smother it in cheap xo sauce .
i 'm happy i found this place for a little happy hour dining .
this has to be the best place for donuts in town ! plus the owners are very nice and seem to always be there .
unfortunately the rest of the food is inconsistent .
we were super excited for a new place in town and hopeful .
they do n't take reservation . we were there waiting for an hour to be seated , but really , the food is worthy to wait this long .
beer was cold but all the mixed drinks had almost no alcohol .
the waitress did n't understand what was wrong with them .
good for carry out or dine in . i will recommend visit once .
the rice was simple , but delicious .
i enjoyed the alcohol beverages and the service was great .
we did not order anything complicated that it took 30 minutes to get to our table .
totally over priced in my opinion .
wine - seemed expensive for a glass but we liked the vibe so decided to have a glass anyway .
i expect pizza to require napkins but , this is impossible to without having to rebuild and repair our pizza ; for that , we 'd make it at home or better yet , order somewhere else .
the interior set up seemed silly , intentionally wasting space .
it 's not cheap .
the only thing that puts me off is paying almost $ 25 for a meal of beef and sushi .
the selection was very poor as far as bottled beers and what was on tap .
the restaurant has an open homey feel , while still feeling like a nice restaurant .
price was outrageous in comparison to the quality .
loved that soju juice they have , recommend the peach and yogurt one mixed together !
beer selection was weak as well , and their bottle menu was inaccurate .
we were there at night with friends for drinks ( get the cucumber mixed drink if you can - it 's super refreshing and tasty ) and there was a fantastic selection of beers and mixers .
do n't bother . the three draft beers our group tried were tasteless , even after we specified we prefer hoppy brews .
however , my true burger was super dry . i asked for medium , but it was more like well done .
i have a very weak stomach for hair in my food .
the bread basket at the start is too good !
all of the food was somewhat bland and to be honest somewhat flavorless .
we stayed at newyork new york , and were thrilled to find this restaurant in our hotel .
the only awkward part was the ambiance .
those pickled carrots or whatever they were are awesome . i love it .
from the cozy little restaurant to the food .
one kind of beer .
my burger and tots was tasty , but my wife 's burger was so salty that i wish that i had n't tasted it ( seriously ... it crunched from all of the salt ) .
look was kind of drab .
the portions are giant .
the lighting was harsh and the whole time i felt like i was in a cafeteria .
great food . reasonable prices .
the bar and drinks looked like a decent selection but did n't drink that night .
my main criticism would be seasoning . i ordered the garlic chicken and i felt it was a bit lacking in flavor and no amount of pepper would correct this .
prices are also very reasonable .
i had two beers and the beer was cold .
there 's no hard liquor , just beer and wine .
prices are pretty reasonable .
they have a good beer selection but unfortunately the beers we ordered were flat .
we often go during happy hour for a beer and appetizer .
the taste was still good though , but we did n't finish it .
the curved hangar style walls and give it both an intimate and cave-like feel .
the drink prices were a bit ridiculous .
prices are also reasonable .
the music volume was just right .
we also had mojitos , which were very tasty and pretty strong .
the duck was quite good , but most pieces were just skin with no meat on it whatsoever .
staff was super friendly .
this place sucks i fucking hate it- nicki the cashier and adam the door guy are terrible . this place let 's in the grossest people .
the margaritas were so weak i 'm not sure they even had tequila .
i wish they had a grilled shrimp or fish option -but both my kids ordered corn dogs and loved them . my husband and i ordered the sampler skillet .
i have never written a bad review before but how we were treated was awful and i hope they see this review .
weak service , beer on tap was two things : warm and stale .
what 's absolutely ridiculous is that the server/bartender all have the same response `` wow , that came out fast '' as if it 's never happened before .
great food at a reasonable price !
we tried a sangria , fruity but strong , plus one of the special cocktails , a jasmine gin tonic .
prices are very reasonable too .
not only does this place provide bad service but the wait staff will alter your receipt .
but this one has chandeliers . note the plural : seriously , there are like 10 chandeliers .
i always make sure to stop here everytime i 'm in vegas . the food is just ... great .
great prices and cheap decent appetizers .
no full bar , only beer .
the setting is gorgeous .
i got the pretzel hotdog and there was nothing too special about it . pretzel was kind of doughy but not terrible .
it was good but just not as good as expected .
they offered to comp 1 dish and i replied that if they comped 2 that would be fine . they then replied that they would only comp 1 ... i said thank you and hung up .
the guacamole is also excellent , as well as their queso .
cool vibe , great music , great décor , great staff and fun place .
beer choices were weak , wine choices were fine .
the bar is very cute , also cozy , and lots of fun .
i had the blue corn enchiladas which were delicious !
the prices are decent .
location wise this restaurant is great , close to my house , few blocks from metro station and parking is very easy . must try !
it was clean and had normal brewery decor , but it 's hard to beat the tempe location with the actual beer brewing gear and old charming character .
both were great . happy drink deals were good , had the vodka lassi , good and inexpensive .
really cheap and delicious .
the bathroom is dirty , which was turn off for me .
drinks are also great .
my only gripe is that they charge $ 5 for a can of sprite !
i had to order the chicken tandoori wrap again .
came in first time today and the hostess was super nice and very clean facility the food was pretty good too .
the atmosphere is great .
but the egg needed some more cooking i did n't know that it would be sunny side up and also the dish had tomatoes i hated tomatoes .
my favorite is either the pastrami and cheese or the hot sausage sandwich but everything here is good .
pretty good for your money too , for vegas standards where everywhere else is twice the cost of food in california and probably quadruple the cost of food elsewhere .
2.5 stars it 's one of those hole in the walls where you feel really bad about yourself after .
my boyfriend and i ordered bottles of mgd beer , which is a pretty common beer .
margaritas had no alcohol in them yet they were the `` special '' of the night .
i do n't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible .
i 'm disappointed that i did n't go with lil caesars $ 5.00 pizza . honestly $ 16.00 for some mediocre at best large pizza .
what was not so great was those two items together cost 13 $ and some change . a little on the expensive side if you ask me .
the price is reasonable .
as i was walking to the door , i could n't help but notice the extreme buildup of dust and black grime on the lighting fixtures and vents .
this place is perfect to go to in the summer or if you have visitors . the butterfly sanctuary is beautiful and it 's truly awesome whether your a child or an adult .
the wait to get our food was horrible . ( over an hour because they apparently lost our ticket ) when we got our food it was cold so we sent it back , after 3times they finally got it right .
making pork cutlet and tempura is n't that hard , i do n't know how they went wrong with that .
finally someone came out and i paid for my takeout , she then said it would be just a few minutes .
the owners are great people that treat you like family .
i 've loved this place for years !
the soup was ok but the salad was bad . too much lettuce that was not fresh , very little shrimp and lobster .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
i 'm willing to bet our margaritas had no tequila in them .
i was so impressed with the variety on the menu and quality of the food .
the beer was fine , and if i had known the dos equis was only 3 dollars a bottle i would have stuck with that rather than the negra modelo .
this was a good experience , but the coffee experience did n't blow us away .
the restaurant lighting is also kind of funny , it 's not dark or light ... just something in the middle which gave you a weird feeling .
there is only room for 4 people comfortably to dine inside .
i love pho , so i 'm probably biased with this review .
so good and cheap pricing .
good selection of beer and helpful bartender . unfortunately , they 'd just tapped out 2 of the 3 beers we chose .
a very beautiful restaurant and we look forward to checking it out for lunch and dinner
no atmosphere , poor lighting , so many things wrong .
great spice and good flavor .
prosciutto with figs & mascarpone , smoked salmon , and salami with pesto were my favorite . the chicken & mozzarella panini was great ...
only real negative was how dark it was ; jet black walls and ceilings , dim lights , but that was n't a big deal .
i liked the feel of it . the rooms are basic but the bathroom we had was nice and spacious .
presentation was poor and my plate was covered in cheese and a moat of grease .
both were freshly made , great taste , and good presentation .
yes , it 's cheap , $ 16 pp but this does not excuse the terrible food .
bad : kinda sketchy and not very clean .
bland . the sauces were watery .
good quality pizza for decent prices . they have good specials .
tasty , clean.. presentation of delivered sushi platter could have been a bit more refined . but the flavor was very good .
and my friends got a daiquiri and a piña colada and they were good too .
beer selection was decent but not many light beers were available . drink menu was impressive .
the tuna roll ( a very basic roll that is standard everywhere and thus should be pretty hard to get wrong ) was no good .
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
the prices are very reasonable .
prices are decent too .
and it only cost one dollar more than the small juice .
we went for happy hour on sunday . we got a deal deal on a pitcher of sangria with the chefs board .
the decor is abysmal ; it looks like an applebees that has n't nailed all of the crap to the walls yet .
such a cool coffee spot ! great view of a nice park too and best part is they are dog friendly , even brought some cookies for our furry friend !
the food is excellent and reasonably priced .
tofu soup is definitely the highlight , comparable to the greatest in l.a. and talk about a great deal , they have daily lunch specials with low prices and nice portions .
i generally do n't pick at fast food restaurants , i understand that for many it is their first job and they are inexperienced in professionalism and attitude .
-1 : a bit annoying that they do n't have a bathroom inside .
ordered a beer in the bottle as they only had the typical `` crap '' in my opinion on draft .
not sure why people rave about the margaritas , i think they either have no tequila , or it 's severly watered down .
gotten take out at least 3 times now for dinner and each time it has been great !
the food was oddly sweet and incredibly bland all at the same time .
went back a second time and tried the nice sized crab meat spring rolls and had the grilled vermicelli , chicken and spring rolls for the main . amazing !
however , the music is so loud that a lunch meeting is impossible to do here , their day business is very low as a result .
$ 65 was the price tag for our late night dinner with the raw items being the most costly .
two of us had steaks , and they were satisfied . i had the ahi tuna appetizer .
the members of the staff are rude , impolite , and have no etiquette in terms of taking a delivery order .
oh and the best part is they 're open late so perfect for my schedule !
we felt sorely disappointed by the service and would never consider patronizing this establishment again .
the food itself was fine , nothing special .
lighting is very dim ( meant for ambience but makes it hard to read the menu ) .
very good wine and beer selection also .
for the mediocre quality of service , the excruciatingly long wait time , and that rude comment at the end , he definitely did not deserve a 40 % tip .
for the price you ca n't really got wrong , saturday/sunday champagne brunch is around $ 12- $ 15 depending on your b connected players card status .
prices are very good for what you get .
very reasonably price for the quality .
this mediocre dish was $ 38 , which is more expensive than anything on the regular menu .
yes it is `` dated '' and lovingly cared for , no it is not the hip painted concrete floors , pin lights , and open ceiling ... get over it , it is part of the experience .
i normally do n't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature .
huh ? bartenders were ok ... though real slow getting me another beer .
i was a virgin sushi person until zuma . it was great from the service to the smokey bourbon cocktail made table side to the food and all ... highly recommend .
the patio is nice ( and covered ) when the weather is good .
two things at sushi couture need to change asap : decor and lighting ( pot lights are so harsh ) .
we ordered for take out the crispy beef , the mango salad and the tom yom soup . the first item was inedible and cold .
so you can go out for a great night and spend $ 20 including tax and tip plus the wine from the saq .
i had the hummus and chicken swarma . both were delicious .
it is impressive to have thai food this bland .
the drinks are priced very reasonably here and there is no cover which i love .
prices here are steep for drinks but the food is quite reasonably priced .
the noodles were not too thin and not too thick .
prices are high too .
prices were pretty reasonable , too .
we shared the southern bbq rib and chicken platter for lunch - which was perfect .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
the only problem i had there was that one of the wings ( we ordered boneless ) was raw .
my falafel was somehow both undercooked and dry , with almost no tahini . additionally , the radishes were limp and tasteless and the parsley was wilted .
lights were dimmed , making it tough to navigate and can only imagine how much more dirty it would look .
we ordered beers and were served some beer cocktail they were n't bad but i just wanted the beer not a cocktail .
this place was great and delicious !
this restaurant is too expensive for the quality of the food . burgers were ok ... child 's meal with a drink ended up costing $ 11 which is more than i have ever paid for a child 's meal .
so i paid over $ 30 plus $ 10 tip , on something we only could eat a part of .
me being a huge music lover i could n't help but notice all these record covers on the wall .
the restaurant itself is a bit on the small side , but it 's very modern with nice decor and layout .
at more a kid for $ 20 and an adult for $ 24 is not bad for a good all you can eat .
tony 's is a great little mom and pop restaurant . it 's family owned , owners are super nice .
a great size portion all for just $ 7.25 is a steal in my books !
their mac and cheese side is one of the best comfort foods ... they offer a great selection of drinks and a better variety of wines than most . the desserts are impeccable ... if you have space !
strike 1. atmosphere is n't just lacking , it 's downright awkward and uncomfortable .
`` tuna roll '' appetizer was unique and amazing .
the prices are great and not over priced at all .
unfortunately , they lack beer on tap but the do have a variety of bottles .
the ceiling tiles are in bad shape , with lots broken and stained . the whole ceiling looks bad .
the drinks were great !
both were fine -- not the best , not the worst .
a friend and i split a scone and the spicy sausage scramble . both were very delicious .
the decoration and interior really suck unfortunately .
even the food may be cheap , the customer service went out the door due to her poor mannerism and professionalism .
however they offer a happy hour on well drinks and draft beers but their draft beer wasnt working and they dont offer bottles in substitution so that was kind of disappointing .
and their prices are extremely reasonable .
i 've also always have gotten their crab cake salad app which i love .
just poor service from the waiter .
great food and drinks .
served in a hollowed out pineapple , it was decadently rich and went perfectly with the side of jasmine rice .
it 's overpriced by a dollar or two but it 's good food .
i liked it a lot . it was fun and just the right amount of loud .
i ordered the salmon which was overdone and on the dry side .
great service , lively atmosphere .
marble tofu , had no pork ( sad ) , to many vegetables , but the sauce had good consistency , instead of tofu in water debacle served in boulder station .
also , their website menu was outdated or wrong , so do n't look there to plan your meal either .
i am sure others have had different experiences here , but as far as my experience i will be returning to this waffle house .
my vodka martini was the only thing nobody at the table liked .
we had to wait almost an hour to over cook a cold meal ?
the prices are fair too !
the food was terrible and the wait staff was rude .
i believe i paid $ 11 - very good price for what i had .
price is good - only draw back is you have to pay for parking .
lots of creepy clown type figurines prevents the 5 star review ...
the decor looks like someones grandmothers home - who was blind - and had bad taste in wallpaper .
nice that they have restrooms but the women 's bathroom was dirty , out of toliet paper and soap .
