price was a bit steep ( my total bill was $ 13 , but considering it 's on bloor across from the museum i suppose their overhead is high ) .
horrible service i do n't know how they stay open ?
super nice great please to get a glass of wine and champs !
the chicken fried rice was dry and pretty boring . the general tao was just ok. clearly everything comes out of pre-made sauce containers .
i was super disappointed in the additional $ 3.00 it cost to get a refill on chips and salsa , and the extra $ 1.00 it cost to get cheese on my tacos .
the room itself was huge , what 's up with the tiny bathroom ?
delicious food , excellent service , strong cocktails , and appropriate wine choices .
salad , bread , drinks , and our waitress was good but we had a restaurant.com coupon and that turned into a fiasco and was handled very poorly by the bar tender who was standing in for the mgr who was on vacation even though they have accepted them previously and we asked the hostess about using it before we were even seated .
that was very frustrating , but luckily they were n't strict on the 45 minute lunch time limit .
the steak bites were pretty good . & the spicy mac & cheese was very good as well .
other than that , this place is grimy , creepy , and nasty .
i thought it was very rude and unprofessional .
i 'm pleased that there is a closer filipino fast food place near me !
the chicken club had a delicious cheese and arugula .
the restaurant is very comfortable and cool on the inside , it 's a nice place to go for lunch to beat the heat .
self service of drinks which i love .
pretty decent food . we splurged in a bottle of rombauer which we finished later that night .
it would be nice if they could get rid of the tags in the men 's room , the graffiti is just kind of ugly and detracts from the rest of the place .
very good ! we sat at the bar and the server was very polite and helpful .
the florescent lights are not only stained , filthy and flashing , but also different colors .
the dark chocolate was rich , not too sweet , with a nice crust and pistachios on top added a nice crunch .
reasonably priced but very cheap on protein .
this is a very trendy place .
the beer is great and the pricing is reasonable .
this is my favorite place to stay in vegas , but i 'm tired of the strip .
currently , i believe they are running a two box special for $ 13.99 plus taxes - still a good deal , but less worthy of a snaking line up .
servers and bartenders are friendly and attentive .
food was really good and cheap .
good food and drinks .
some are more inventive than others ( my favorite flavors are the creative cardamom espresso , and the relatively more familiar peanut butter ) .
men 's room was not even close to clean with tissues in shoved in all facilities and no paper towels or hand dryers and no hand soap .
they have only two or three beers on draft and the rest come in a bottle .
this casino is very good looking both on the outside with fire and fountains and on the inside with chandeliers and grand carpets . the movie theater is nice and clean .
our 89 year old friend we took had a hard time standing for that long and no one offered her a chair . after we had been there for 30 minutes someone finally offered us water .
the restaurant is very cozy . loved the look of the place .
all the cocktails are very creative as well but i 'm a sucker for a restaurant that serves sake and they have sake bottles available .
i loved the decor and atmosphere - very traditional and quaint .
this new restaurant is great .
fairly priced , good food and good service .
beer choices were weak , wine choices were fine .
not sure what 's up with the decor though .
dinner for two was about $ 35 to $ 40 considering that it 's fast food .
with a $ $ $ restaurant , you expect a certain level of food & service ... but you 're not going to get it here .
my wife and i visited this restaurant on july 6 , 2009 , the waiter was unhappy that he only had a few tables to wait on , yet this seemed to many , he was getting the tables orders mixed up , and forgetting the order that people were sat down .
the mushroom fritters were delicious and were eaten up quickly .
i 'm usually ignored , spoken to in a condescending manner or quite abruptly .
way overpriced especially for what you get in quality and portions .
the portions are small and overpriced ... .but the price is a filter and what makes this place nice .
all were enjoyed and i got the leftovers .
i started out with a cactus margarita , which is sweet , but also strong .
in all honesty the place does give off a `` hole in the wall '' feeling , and the really outdated decor does n't help .
unfortunately they only have a few mixed drinks , beers , and wines - no full bar .
the whole place was really dirty - stains on the walls and the floors were disgusting .
corned beef was dry , cabbage was a little undercooked , and i am used to the traditional mashed potatoes .
place is super cute , love the decor .
the menu is pricey ( although they do have reasonably priced sandwich items ) but amazing .
we went for restaurant week and loved it .
i was here on a sunday evening with my bff before going to the rod stewart concert during our girls only weekend together .
my husband got blackened chicken with pasta and his chicken was pretty good but the pasta had no oil or anything on it so it kinda just clumped together .
the price is right , some item is cheap and some item is ok price .
not only that , but the spice was there too . it was not overwhelming , but it was there .
the space has a clean and minimalist design yet catches the eye .
most dishes are $ 5.99 and the food was decent .
good menu and reasonable prices .
too full for dessert , i opted for a refreshing glass of their brazilian lemonade .
meagan was an awesome bartender and helped us pick between meals as well as specialty cocktails .
the lighting seemed quite dark to me , not sure if that is appropriate for a bbq joint .
we did n't order any alcohol though which would have easily made our bill closer to $ 500 .
moved to scarborough about two years now , and was looking for a great restaurant that was clean , great atmosphere and excellent dim sum . this is the place !
it feels kind of creepy .
great food and drink .
( warning : the entire place is very dark and it is difficult to read the menu without glasses and/or a flashlight . )
decor was simple ikea like furniture - nothing wrong as long as it works .
my hubby loved it and could n't believe how large the to go portion was or how fresh the ingredients were .
that came to over $ 18 which is pretty expensive to me when you come away hungry .
the price is very cheap with a good amount of food for only $ 5.95 for lunch though .
a beautiful and newer property . this place is really nice .
we had to pour our wine 4 times and this was n't cheap wine .
i can eat in silence but the combination of the poor lighting is straight up awkward .
sandwich was good texture and not soggy .
not a good place for wine , but about 30 draft beers .
i try something different every time i go and have never been disappointed .
amazingly high quality especially considering the reasonable prices !
last of all , my waiter ... started off pretty creepy ... like gon na poison your food and then you wake up in a basement type of creepy .
this is definitely on our short list the cocktails were strong and well made .
great place for a quick bite or take out .
and the lemonade is great .
the quality of the meat is very low ... literally chopped up small bits of chicken and beef to make it seem like it 's a lot . the beef was very dry ... i do n't think i 'll be going here again
it does tend to get cramped , and sometimes the employees checking ids at the door can be rude .
the portion size was great , the food was steaming hot . the quality of the chicken in the pad thai was poor , all dark meat fatty and tendon ... just yuck .
needless to say , i 've had much better tortas for half the price ( $ 9 ) .
the food was amazing and who can resist $ 5 wine and pitchers .
the bathroom was disgusting and out of paper towels . the floors were dirty and it looked like the toilet had been leaking making the floor wet .
the men 's bathroom was not clean and the hand towel was jammed .
the pricing is reasonable .
i loved their beverage menu and they have a decent happy hour menu ! kyle was a superb bartender !
the restaurant layout was totally weird but who really cares .
run-down hotel , room is dirty ( there is a booger on the tissue box cover in the bathroom ) .
the sushi was abysmal . the rice was dry and had a styrofoam taste to it .
highly recommend everyone to try it , it 's definitely something different
the chicken was flavorful , and stuffed with a lot of foie gras , they show you the whole chicken before they slice it up to serve which was a nice touch .
not bad for $ 12.49 .
over-seasoned , salty and mediocre food .
beers on tap were mostly simple ones nothing to get excited about .
it 's so low class - more suitable for a fast food restaurant or a gym locker room than a restaurant that charges nearly $ 100 with tip for two salads , and three drinks .
kind of cheapens it even though it 's kind of cute .
the desserts were amazing as well , and again , extremely large .
really cool place to just chill and have a drink before dinner . the atmosphere is great and very relaxing .
from the tremendous clutter of all the weird decor to some odd items like a statue of a topless women ?
their salmon came with this quinoa which was the best i 've ever had . it had this wonderful nutty taste and it was crunchy .
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
thank you ms , another great dining spot for my list .
by the time we had our pre-order ( where they take your order 10 minutes before they seat you so you do n't take up a table too long ) , i was n't very hungry and definitely did n't want hot eggs .
you can have a fresh , delicious , guilt free meal at a great price .
towels everywhere , questionable fluids on the floor , just completely dirty .
the burgers are awesome . prices are cheap and the food you get is good value .
good service and food but not washroom had pee covering the walls . which makes me lose my appetite .
went for lunch today and the sliders ( one pork , one beef and one chicken ) were amazing !
we started with a bottle of wine and did n't do any apps or salad , went right to the entrees .
while a decent tasting burger and nothing bad , it 's quite small for an $ 11.50 price tag .
the meat was very tender and the flavor from the hummus and the tomatillo sauce was fantastic .
the menu is very brief but very difficult to read with the lack of lights .
the edamame was also undercooked and tasteless and the dragon roll was also tasteless , despite all the sauces the put all over it to help give the sad eel they served some flavor .
i absolutely love the palazzo . elegant and fun .
the food is high priced and not very good .
the beer i got ( which was the cheapest on tap besides miller lite ) was not bad .
the pizza was good but not amazing .
we bring our 17 month in and the loud music covers his early morning noises .
they are reasonably priced for their food selection .
the only feedback i have is the brick fencing that separates the street peasants from the wealthy and rich made me feel uneasy ( it 's very poor and financially unstable looking ) it was either that or the girl crying over the microphone playing piano .
really good food for such a cheap price !
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
we thought there would be sushi , especially with the $ 12 per person weekend price , but there was no sushi .
i used to go to phil 's all the time with my grandparents , and i have to say it has n't changed a bit since i used to go there many years ago . great service , and tasty breakfast .
the sangria was great , the food too !
yes i was sick yes it was raw fish , so i do n't who 's to blame .
the help is friendly , the food is decent and very reasonably priced .
i happened to be there saturday night and they had a real band with talented musicians who sounded just like billy joel .
staff was extremely friendly , fast and efficient .
the service was excellent . our server was very friendly and entertaining .
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
6. my only complaint and they would get five stars is the price , it 's pricey i guess rent on a strip casino is not cheap .
rice was clumpy . staff was unpleasant .
only to be told we would have to go out , get our id 's checked then wait in line again to get in .
as for alcohol it 's bottled beer and a few selections of wine only here .
sommelier was outstanding on the wine selection and jumped all over the bad bottle that came to our table .
then you can walk around downtown vegas and enjoy all the very cool things that are around , a couple of very nice brew pubs around the corner .
literally it may only equate to $ 14 - $ 20 dollars an but its the principle .
the potato salad is amazing ... holy crap it is so delicious !
and the prices are great .
the food here is ok. reasonable prices .
i immediately called down to the front desk and they sent up a house keeping manager who was nice but kept making excuses for how bad the room looked .
this is probably my favorite restaurant ... soups are great , mock duck is fantastic , anything with mushrooms is amazing .
it was loud and sort of clubby , but that 's part of the experience .
we ordered a couple mojitos as well - they were good , but the sangria just blew em out of the water .
amazing property with great food & great service . this would make for a beautiful wedding venue and was such a treat to walk through and see the gardens and the cute little boutique after we enjoyed a nice spring outdoor lunch !
we 've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed .
the food was uninspired , as was the decor , which is just your typical dark wood pub style .
copper star has a chill atmosphere , artsy appealing aesthetic , friendly staff and delicious treats on their menu .
the blueberry margarita and a special drink they were making that day were awesome !
we started with the steak and lobster tartare flavored with truffle oil and it was delicious , probably the best tartare i 've ever had .
i visit this location quite often , i 've always been a mobile app person and i love not having to wait !
update : depending on who is working when you come , sometimes you get a pleasant experience , sometimes you get a unpleasant experience due to their rude behavior .
although this visit we remained alcohol free , last visit the smoked bourbon and spiced sangria were terrific start points !
a gross hole-in-the-wall that was bad as its tacky ambience and ugly surroundings .
so good and refreshing .
they were just awful and i do not think the tequila was patron .
it looks like they painted the walls , slapped some mismatched kirkland 's crap on the walls and called it a restaurant .
to drink i had a sangria , which was both refreshing and tasty .
each one has fresh and delicious ingredients and cooked to perfection .
this place is amazing ! the sauce is just like i remember growing up at my grandparents house on sunday !
the spiked float was to die for . i got it with baileys and it was fantastic !
overall , the patio had a nice view when the weather is nice , which it was tonight and it was packed .
they have a very reasonable happy hour and a nice selection of drinks .
i think it was a happy hour special , but still . $ 12 for 5 drinks ?
so much potential , yet the result is awkward and kinda drab .
we were told to seat ourselves , that the server would be with us shortly ... 45 minutes go by , and nothing ... finally we give up , go in and tell them we have been waiting this long .
especially for the price !
the bartender did n't know the beers they had on tap and seemed pretty out of it .
staff is prompt and friendly food is good .
sat down at our table for 10-15 min and no server came . turns out server was only paying attention to the 10 people party behind our table and completely missed us .
considering the quality of the pizza , everything on the menu is reasonably priced .
the food is reasonably priced .
good prices and good food .
great place to try .
the decor is trendy with a lounge like ambiance .
it 's so fluorescent bright in there it feels like you 're being interrogated .
while we did not drink any booze , they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers , wine , and specialty cocktails .
food is good but wait time is ridiculous for the food to be served even when it 's not crazy busy . apparently they now only take cash for dim sum ... new policy should be placed somewhere or at least mentioned
totally does not fit the vibe of the rest of the hotel ... ( see review )
it effectively has 2 dinning rooms and you can hear the music throughout the place but if you want to see the musicians you need to sit in the main one facing the side street .
it was all pretty underwhelming .
the prices are good , nothing too expensive , and the sushi is fresh .
it 's just kind of looks a little rundown and dirty .
they also have desserts with my favorite being their cinnamon rolls .
great drink selection and amazing , quality cocktails .
i waited in line for more than 5 minutes and there was no employee behind the counter when the lady employee came out she was so rude the food was cold and dry .
they do have a full bar but no beer on tap .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
while the food is great , i ca n't justify the $ 420 bill for two people .
except this is n't quite as cheap .
the location is very hip , lots of fun places nearby , the interior is beautiful , clean and modern ... we sat on the patio which was great !
it is a family owned restaurant . i highly recommend this restaurant .
we started by ordering a trio of pinot noirs from the large and interesting wine list ( many good ones by the glass ) .
worst service sat us down at a dirty sticky table and then no service for over 15 minutes , sat and waited for a waiter or waitress to show with no such luck .
after such a bad experience you would think they would also cover the one glass of wine and pint of beer but nope !
it felt almost chaotic . the music was loud - the kind with drums beating that gives you a little anxiety , and there were at least 3 or 4 loud bangs from plates dropped or furniture tipping over .
good food especially the appetizer shrimp and the 10 oz steak .
so reasonably priced too !
i did n't feel comfortable here .
we waited around 15 mins for someone to take our drink order but finally had to ask for help .
delicious comfort food and massive portions .
the receptionist gave a free upgrade to the 51st floor with a terrace view .
the decor and the spot is just too cute .
it used to be amazing but the last 2 times i 've been there , the chicken was overcooked and dry . so disappointing !
with thirty some craft beers and wines on tap , beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender .
no good . clean but weird decor .
odd location , next to no frills . looks like it would suck , ugly sign , boring inside .
the chicken shawarma is delicious ( be sure to opt for all the sauces : hummus , tahini , garlic , chili ) . the falafel were some of the best i 've had anywhere , crunchy on the outside , moist inside , and with a nice herby flavor .
wonderful place to go for a casual meetup or a fancy night out .
ingredients seem pretty fresh , and it 's really really cheap .
walking in it smelt like they just got done burning the rice ( good thing i wasnt there for rice ) .
fries : 2/5 very little flavor iced tea ( for those of us who do n't drink soda ) .
love the ambiance here ! the drinks ( both alcoholic and coffee ) are delicious .
for the quality of the food the prices were reasonable , and there were selections on the menu from just over $ 10.00 all the way up to $ 60.00 or more .
bellagio only charges $ 35 and it is a cut above .
good , but a hard call at $ 5 .
not bad , but they could definitely add some taps or bring in some bottled beer .
i noticed tequila behind the bar but did n't see any beer and am unaware of what the happy hour entails .
for the price . pretty damn good .
this place was so cool and the drinks we 're verrrrry tasty . i got the one of their cocktails ( forgot the name ) but it tasted like a pina colada but much better and we also got a couple of the $ 3 daiquiri shooters ( el dorado ) and the bartenders were very friendly and everything that they were pouring tasted delicious .
i am all for reusing perfectly usable furniture but just rolling some interior house paint over it does n't really appeal to me .
service has always been pleasant , attentive , and unassuming .
quite glad that we ate outdoors as interior is way loud , as reputed .
the service is pretty quick . the prices are reasonable .
for $ 8 , it 's not bad .
the waiter did not seem super attentive , he was just acceptable .
service is good and prices are fair .
beers were ok , but they were bottled beers , so it would be pretty difficult for them to ruin that .
we also had margaritas which you could hardly taste anything but a pre-made margarita mix .
the diavola pizza was great but i could 've done without the meat and went with traditional margherita .
the prices are good too .
it looks the exact same as the sahara location though and the place is clean and the ambience is nice enough to sit and enjoy lunch .
this location is always super busy but we had a great waiter , ricky , and he took excellent care of us .
was with friends so made with good food and good friends very nice night out .
i love the decor ! this location is clean and spacious ... lots of tvs ( mostly showing sports the night that we dined in ) .
i find the price is in the high end $ $ $ $ .
the tables , chairs , and walls were kind of dinged up and worn looking .
their alcoholic drinks are nice , had me all giggly .
the price is super affordable .
to make matters worse , they refused to honor our restaurant.com certificate because it is restaurant week .
the good . the patio was nice and had good ambiance .
service was friendly and fast .
again , they were n't that busy so not sure what the problem was .
my gf had the chicken piccata and i had the shrimp scampi ... both dishes were just spot on amazing .
we took a seat at the large bar and started with a glass of tea , which was pretty good !
they have cheap prices in my opinion .
the decor was super outdated and dirty looking though , and the furniture was showing obvious signs of wear .
for a bill that totalled $ 160 for 3 people , we had two pizzas that lacked flavour and one pasta dish that was reportedly delicious but not worth $ 28 . do n't be fooled by the truffle mushroom , they were not anything like the authentic black truffle mushrooms that i have had before ... very disappointing
i ordered bbq chicken salad and got - literally - 2 tiny nuggets of chicken , about 1 inch each - on a pile of lettuce for over $ 10 .
but only for beer .
the server then said they only have cheddar but she would make sure .
all you can eat good . sushi good especially frying jason , lasagna and california .
do n't use the bathroom and do n't expect a clean interior .
you may not want to work that shift , but that does not mean you can be rude to customers , especially when we were so nice to you , until you started ignoring us , and making snarky remarks , and which point we ordered our drinks from the bar , just to avoid you .
it was terribly salty and tasted like it just came out of a can .
expensive burgers but amazing . i guess you get what you pay for .
we finally contacted eat24 , which we ordered through , to see if they could help us .
certainly not a bad restaurant ; but at the price your paying you could do better .
only bummer is that i did n't see any draft beer , only bottles .
there was a crude and lewd drawing hanging on the chandelier and there was not adequate towels linens or pillows .
it is a great deal and great prices .
too creepy for me .
because of that , we are not likely to return .
the decor is n't hard on the eyes either .
the prices are really low for what you get so i 'm pretty happy with it .
it looks like they have a great happy hour and when the weather is cooler i 'm sure the patio is going to be packed i live 32 miles away and i will come back
minimalist interior , i mean seriously .
my wife and i stopped in here for a nice dinner .
the weather was perfect , and the scenery was nice , although the trees were dropping a good deal of pollen .
when we first walked in i was n't even sure where to go or what to do .
not a bad bar .
the staff are always friendly and i highly suggest checking it out !
food tastes good and the lunch $ 9 and dinner $ 15 options are unbeatable .
i started with a refreshing pre-dinner drink .
great prices for decent food .
full of fruit , wine , and liquor ; it goes down smooth and one glass and you can start to feel nice and relaxed .
good selection of drinks and beer on tap but i was dissapointed they did n't have a drink menu so we had no idea what anything cost .
it was a lot of food and reasonably priced .
only had water to drink so can not comment on the drink or beer pours .
te only reason i 'm not giving 5 stars is the price.. i think it 's a bit $ $ $ . i would eat there more often if there were coupons or the prices came down .
great design , great ambience and absolutely great coffee . quiet but alive , perfect for reading , studying or going through a creative process .
the only let down was that there was no beer on tap .
the deserts were mediocre .
enjoyed sitting on the patio with all the heaters .
the steamed dumplings are off the charts delicious .
not my favorite but not bad either .
great food and reasonable prices .
we sat on the patio , which is fairly nice .
prices are affordable , especially at lunch .
the total was like 18 bucks , damn !
this place has some really good food ! i was sad when the old location closed , but now that this place reopened i 'm thrilled !
the draft list was n't bad but nothing out of the norm .
have n't been there in awhile , had a great time with desiree .
we had the desert trio ( you get to pick which 3 , which i loved ! )
went for happy hour and the have a great menu for food and drinks !
i had slightly higher expectations , especially with the $ 3.5 orange juice , which seemed like it was from concentrate because of the extremely bitter aftertaste and it had no pulp . that really overshadowed anything that i ordered and the food , was alright .
this is a wonderful surprise !
the shrimps were huge and fresh !
with some subtle lighting this place would be great but i felt like i was in a parking lot - you could not turn towards the one light without getting a painful beam of light in your eyes .
there 's a late night happy hour menu that 's only $ 19 per person .
this came for no justified reason . shame on him !
awesome food at affordable prices .
i do n't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine .
they had a great cocktail list , the lychee martini was great .
i was seated across and was able to look out there large windows and opening to the restaurant and watch people .
`` i 'm too sexy for this mall ... and i do a little turn on the catwalk . ''
its a small dining room in need of some tlc ( did n't appear dirty , but decoration wise ) .
prices were also fair .
the only feedback i have is the brick fencing that separates the street peasants from the wealthy and rich made me feel uneasy ( it 's very poor and financially unstable looking ) it was either that or the girl crying over the microphone playing piano .
the prices are very reasonable .
i kind of enjoy how tacky the taste in decoration is .
i asked for a hefeweizen but no ; they have 30 beers on tap including 6 different ipas , but not a hefeweizen in the house .
the pancakes were sooo good -- they can definitely feed 2-3 people .
also , it was pretty pricey for a meal combo , about 12 bucks and that didnt even include a drink
i think it 's a great deal bc the pizza is already $ 15- $ 17 alone .
the waitstaff was friendly and the meal was beyond delicious . the waitstaff checked on us frequently and made great menu suggestions .
staff are welcoming and attentive .
decor does n't really make sense with fancy chandeliers and bright green chairs but that 's not the worst thing about this place .
i would not recommend this place . they have horrible customer service .
i would n't go here for a nice , longer dinner but a great place to grab a good , quick meal !
great drink , although the sangria was a little light .
great fast food at a low price .
one of the best shawarma chicken wraps ever .
and at $ 5 and $ 6 the price is right . this location is take out only , surrounded by free parking
the seafood stew with rice was perfect and the service was fast and attentive .
great place for a casual lunch at a reasonable price ( for vegas ) .
reasonably priced , too .
combo with two salads and a drink for under $ 12 is not a bad deal .
the chicken had a lot of flavor and it was cooked perfectly .
tasty food at reasonable price .
which with guac , is the perfect combination .
the decor is beautiful .
it 's down this weird concrete hallway that make you feel like you might get jumped or raped in there .
the decor is modern with spacious seating . during the event they set up tables with free appetizers such as pizza , calamari , cheese and bruschetta .
btw , the mango margarita was very good also .
decor : it 's so cute inside . the decor is just really inviting to me .
nasty and weak margaritas that were being poured from a bucket . plain entrees .
the 4 tacos have the perfect combination of spicy and sweet braised beef rib meat on corn tortillas with asian hot sauce and tangy slaw .
place has a good vibe .
fast , yummy , fair priced lunch .
a different time , i decided to have a glass of frangelico while the dudes sipped on their scotch .
good bourbon , and even some unique gins on the list .
they used to have 3 courses and now they only have two ( for $ 15 , ala carte for $ 12 ) .
all in all , it was 30 dollars in total .
it was tough and dry and yucky , yes , yucky .
otherwise it 's awkward .
great food and drinks on happy hour .
their cocktails are mediocre and for $ 15 it 's not worth it .
my eyes hurt with all the cheap florescent lighting in here .
tandoori was a little too spicy for them but we enjoyed !
it was pretty good chicken and it is hard to screw up a newcastle .
serrano 's has great food , service , and atmosphere . we 'll definitely make a return visit .
well worth the price , only $ 14.00 .
the meats on both pasta 's were a bit fatty and nothing to special . one of the pasta 's was made using a very thick noodle which i was n't a fan of .
we always have a great time and enjoy the bartender/server valerie . she has a great personality and fits right in with our group .
i 've never had to wait long for a table , and the outdoor seating area is the best place to sit on a nice weather day .
so i 'm not sure whether the minimum wage increase has an effect on prices or whether this restaurant thinks two pieces of fried chicken with three sauces is worth $ 16 plus tax .
beers on tap were mostly simple ones nothing to get excited about .
really good , cheap prices .
- though the food was mediocre at best , the bill was $ 10 .
decent margarita , but in the wrong glass .
we did order some margaritas and again they were n't bad just your typical margarita .
plus , it was tiny and soggy ! blech !
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
kudos also goes to the bar , which had a nice selection of delicious cocktails .
weak service , beer on tap was two things : warm and stale .
it 's a crap shoot as to whether you get what you ordered , the employees do n't seem clean or careful , and i 'm tired of complaining to management .
overall , the atmosphere is really pleasant ( it 's like sitting in an outdoor french cafe , despite being inside ) and the food is pretty good , especially for breakfast .
awful service ! read the reviews but decided to try it anyways.. walked in , waited close to 5 minutes for anyone to say a word to us though it was not busy .
it is do disappointing to see a restaurant that already charges $ 2.50 for a glass of tea , cut costs by turning a side item into a total joke .
the restaurant was so dark that multiple people had to use their iphone flash lights to read the menu which is not only annoying , but also distracting when you are getting blinded by another persons flashlight .
they have only a few beers on tap , a pretty good choice of bottled beer and a basic bar stock .
chicken cacciatore , ciopino , eggplant parmesan , and spaghetti bolognese were among the entrees we ordered and each was freshly prepared and so very flavorful ! the bruschetta , as an appetizer , was also plentiful and yummy !
i was really happy with the tea , i love my tea !
always good drinks and they have a heavy pour .
i love the spicy cashew dish too . the bf always gets a noodle dish .
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
we both ordered the ultimate feast .
as far as going to the restaurant i 'd avoid it at all costs . the food sucks .
there 's not a bad dish on the menu .
the beer list was disappointing .
the place was nice , good environment and fun ... had the suns and world series on ... .
terrible front of house staff - rude and indifferent .
we went during their sunday funday specials , and it was great ! we got a cheap bottle of sparkling wine and enjoyed the adorable atmosphere .
dora - we loved the bottle of wine !
they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more , but i 've never had to wait for more than 20 minutes to be seated .
the uni pasta was decent but i didnt get a lot of uni flavor .
i asked for a dish containing pork , chicken and shrimp but asked for no meat , extra veggies .
they have some silly paintings hanging up that are amusing .
when we were finally seated we had to wait about 10 minutes before our waiter came up to take our drink orders with his hands full of dirty dishes from another table ( yuk ! )
for $ 15 cad , it 's pretty expensive compared to 800 yen in osaka .
it was so light and fluffy .
i like their beers . the food was ok and their prices are reasonable although i think could be 15 % lower .
we did n't drink , but it looked like they had 32 different beers on tap .
m the drink specials were decent ; cheap for vegas but average priced for anywhere else in the country .
my drink was fantastic ! fruity and sweet , just the way i like my cocktails !
keep in mind the portions are very large and the minimum charge per person is n't so bad , even if you share a dish between two and have to tag on the extra $ , because you will leave full and satisfied .
beers were $ 1 at the bar which rules , and they had some sort of hefeweizen that tasted good to me .
we wait forever to get our food that is cold and i mean a cold breakfast is the worst .
great beers , bartenders do n't know anything about the beers . the menu is ok. not bad to pair beer with .
this is one of the few places i happily spend more than $ 10 per person !
3 of my friends split the big calzone ( could easily feed 3 people ) and i got a personal pizza . it was all delicious , was a fan of the thin crust !
where else can you get a dinner with good wine for $ 30 .
the wine list and desert list are also great .
it had waaaay too many fish flakes that overpower the smell and taste , after trying to take most of the off , we decided to skip the top layer and eat the rest instead but we could n't because it was so tasteless .
i also ordered the egg plant with pork hot pot .
cool place for out-of-towners .
i 'm a fan of dim lighting , but not so dim that the menu becomes impossible to read . it was also too loud to have a proper conversation .
the donair sub is a unique creation that fuses giro meat with typical submarine ingredients and donair sauce .
food was very good . staff were super super friendly as we asked lots of questions .
they have a drink with beer and grapefruit . nice idea !
zipped in here for happy hour well drinks on a friday .
i find his bibimbap a bit bland , but that 's probably because i generally like to eat rice with something saucey .
the servers were nice ... .ca n't complain , casual atmosphere , not to roomy layout but not too jam packed either .
i also recommend the chicken shawarma wrap or platter . the chicken is always tender and the tahini is dare i say it ... out of bounds !
does n't look that impressive from outside but nice inside .
the chicken strips came out with some pieces piping hot and some that were soggy with a cold center .
the wine by glass was a 2012 chardonnay , exquisite !
good music , people enjoying themselves ... lots of large hd tv 's that provide exciting sports from all angles .
ryan , ryan 's helper and the bar tender all promote a very friendly welcoming atmosphere at the pig .
the room was old and tiny which i could have dealt with too but the wallpaper in bathroom was filthy . the entire bathroom was dirty .
it had a delicious dressing on it and was a very good salad .
it 's good quality . maybe the higher price and the casual atmosphere turn some people off .
especially with the sauce it comes with .
one thing i found weird was that the lighting was too bright for a restaurant .
probably the worst thing i ever ate .
the staff is superb here , very nice and welcoming .
selection of drinks is excellent and the wine list is amazing .
outside sitting is nice .
the lighting was a bit dim , but still enough light that i was n't squinting .
it 's small and dark inside but it 's a great place to grab a quick bite .
totally worth it and we saved the cab far with $ 15 breakfast instead of $ 50 !
food is decently priced for what you get .
making mistakes around 20 something dollars which is very reasonable considering the quality of the state !
good food good atmosphere , and pretty good prices too .
considering the quality , i thought $ 12 for each sandwich was a bit high .
hand crafted cocktails were excellent but a bit overpriced for an off strip bar beer taps were down for repair but there were ipas and other bottle and canned options .
i did n't see one decent beer on tap or in the coolers .
coming in at $ 35 a piece for 8oz of cold meat , that is totally unacceptable .
the cheese sauce was overly sweet and tasted a bit off .
i would say very good but , the canned mushrooms were a bit rubbery and were a bummer .
she got really snotty about it and said , `` i 'm sorry you did n't like my pictures . ''
the seaweed was tough and the sushi did not seem very fresh . the tempura veggies were pretty good .
the delish food , the cheerful , knowledgeable waitstaff , drinks , and even the music ( any place playing the doors , led zeppelin , and the song `` relax '' has my vote ) was great .
good prices too . quick service .
nice location , near the modern art museum , neat little set up .
the restaurant layout was totally weird but who really cares .
service is great and i found the server to be very nice and attentive .
some of my favorite happy hour food items : the small salads , loaded skins , street tacos , calamari , and spinach artichoke dip .
i was so excited to try this place out , even more so because we were celebrating m 's birthday .
it was a beautifully crafted piece of meat .
the camembert was served cold , which does n't do it justice at all .
sorry the service was terrible . does it matter how the rest of the experience was ?
very nice location on the water with a large outdoor patio .
unfortunately they only have a few mixed drinks , beers , and wines - no full bar .
oh was it strong .
i went with the seafood soup while my wife got the roasted pork ... the seafood soup was great . i added pork belly and it was super flavorful .
i will definitely return and would highly recommend !
beers were good ( even though they didnt have any beer specials ) ... hmmmm .
the portions were pretty huge for both of us .
( pictures attached ) i ordered the chorizo queso but when i opened it they failed to drain the terrible grease , leaving my queso tasting and looking like a greasy soup . it was awful !
we selected a bottle of oregon pinot noir ( super fair $ 7 corkage fee ) that our waiter recommended , it was so excellent that we has a second bottle = ) the wild mushroom flatbread was a perfect sharing size to pair with our pinot , seriously hands down and hats off to 750ml .
beyond this soup the rest of the meal was great !
beer choices were weak , wine choices were fine .
the food is nothing special and super expensive .
their unsweetened iced tea was good , but nothing great .
the food quality was good and reasonably priced .
the owner frank came over to introduce himself and chat for a bit , which was awesome .
you only get up to $ 8 off .
the prices are good .
i moved to tempe a couple years ago for school and went to a couple pizza spots - some good , some bad .
but i was disappointed , sadly .
prices are very reasonable .
the kiddos and i went today for the first time and we loved it !
a nice place to hang out with decent coffee , a pleasant atmosphere , and a cool neighborhood .
great menu , lots of choices . pasta and meat dishes are very good .
service is slow but very friendly , and the whole place is windows so it 's a pleasant spot to sit and people-watch .
my $ 11 dollar total meal would 've been $ 16 anywhere else .
pretty good . prices reasonable .
parking is a pain in the a** the escalator is kind of scary due to the sideways movement ... and they 're actually really ugly .
the service is great , smiles and friendly atmosphere .
she confirmed everything , so it 's not like our final order was actually incorrect .
the prices were pretty good .
the place is small and that really only adds to the ambiance .
everything , including the service was incredible !
live music , great food and great beer is a good time !
tried this place as well , was just as sad as the other . they dont open when they are suppose to be , given their posted hours , and the ppl are rude here .
it was the only thing they ordered .
the decor is rustic country . the food is amazing .
as a whole , pretty unimpressive especially when the sandwich cost $ 10.50 .
a little expensive- but then again you are n't spending a bunch of money on booze .
also very reasonable prices .
definitely my new favorite bar on the north side !
this may sound weird , but the shoes were actually somewhat comfortable .
however , i hated the interior design of the restaurant .
dining in , my mil and i shared the fried chicken , the shanghai lumpia and the pork skewers , plus an order of garlic fried rice .
sure , the ambiance may be basic but that does n't bother me .
had the hot & sour soup which was amazing .
went to this restaurant for the first time and absolutely loved it !
for a $ 15 burger i expect a lot . this $ 15 burger is not justified .
the prices are pretty inexpensive considering what you get .
the décor is beautiful and my room had a wonderful view .
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
the choice is really yours . all of the seating is well thought out and the place is nicely decorated .
as someone else noted that this used to be the shish cafe makes it even worse .
we had a nice lunch at abuelo 's .
the fresh fruits are always great and compliment the waffles and ice cream well .
its good cheap and nice ha ! great prices compared to other places and they serve a good amount .
i 'm not fond of the mismatched furniture and the seats are painfully uncomfortable ( unless you get a booth ) .
for the price that you pay for dimsum , there 'd better be something special !
we sat down and ordered the stuff mushrooms for $ 9 the waiter said do i want two or 4 well the $ 9 price is for only two .
pretty good quality food . the price is reasonable .
i gave this one a three stars mostly because we ordered a pitcher or margarita and honestly i did not taste any tequila .
the steak had a weird smell and a bad aftertaste .
i love the setting of deli shop inside restaurant .
also pineapple very dry and tasteless . very disappointed .
i came here with the groupon special 20 $ worth of food for $ 11 . reaching $ 20 was easy since the pizza ( only one size ) was $ 15 .
great food ! love their cajun fish tacos with their citrus slaw along with the cajun beans .
it 's so awkward and uncomfortable and all conversation is obliterated by the sound .
any way the food was meh ... although i liked their lobster sauce , i thought the lobster was chewy .
service was quick and attentive .
the ambiance was cool , so much color and life in their building , the seating set up is different and very unique .
prices are somewhat reasonable .
that in of itself is not a bad thing really , and probably part of the charm , but its painted gray and looks depressing .
little disappointed with drink , specially margarita .
no return and no exchange policy is so not nice !
i had the pizza sandwich and there was barely anything in the sandwich and no flavor . my boyfriend got a chicken sandwich and again no flavor or substance .
also 14 wings for $ 17.99 is to high .
order it and you will not be sorry .
stemmed like a typical bar with too many beers available , but did have my lame beer if choice coors light .
smh the manager got mad at me because i wanted my correct change which was $ 3 instead of $ 2 , in what world is it an issue for someone to give me my own money i wo n't ever return to this pizzahut and its crazy that i had to deal with this from a manager
at 6pm , i walked in a lovely large open space that fit groups of all sizes .
i think it needs more lighting of some kind .
when the server asked how our food was we told her not good and we would not return .
the service is always great and the staff are really nice .
great servers/bartenders , decent atmosphere with good music and solid food .
awesome class with passionate instructors and classmates ! learned a lot and had a great time .
the price is right although the extra charges are a bit annoying that are tacked onto the bill for each night .
my fiancé 's eggs were over easy and looked like they were microwaved .
the drinks are good as well with their thai mojito being a favourite .
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
the ambiance was pretty nice .
i do n't mind paying for good food , but this is robbery .
the booths are nice and roomy which is good if you have lil ones .
it was n't my favorite soup and it was n't that hot either , so i would n't recommend it .
the bartender , anthony , was very friendly , attentive , and knowledgeable .
rude and disrespectful staff on friday night - claudia and martha named on the receipt need some courtesy lessons and the gentleman cooking this $ 15 cheese steak needs a new profession . i wo n't walk in this place again .
service is quick but extremely unfriendly .
they have patio seating which is a bonus and great seating options throughout .
the price is way over-priced , plus you have to pay extra for rice which is ridiculous .
good food , good drinks . at the end of the day however , you 're paying the rent in food prices .
this place is awesome !
price was reasonable but hard to get a glass of wine under 30 bucks .
i ate 1 piece and the rest went right in the trash .
now that i discovered that there is a new owner - who is actually nice to her employees - i will have to start coming here more often .
she ordered me the house wine that was on happy hour and delicious !
their prices are cheap and the food is great .
the restaurant is on the expensive side of the spectrum for sure : two of us spent 72 dollars tips included without ordering anything particularly expensive .
the food was so simple , yet so delicious . the chicken i had was perfect , exactly how i want a roast chicken .
the prices are a touch high but not outrageous so it seems worth it .
the service is fast and the chef is great fun . the food portion and taste is great and the lunch price is amazing .
what bar does n't have coors light ? did not have it in bottle or draft .
i 've had better meals for 2 people with wine where the total was $ 200- $ 250 .
i think that after an abundance of meat and protein , something soft and not overwhelming should be dessert choices . but unfortunately , they did n't have the `` refreshing '' dessert choices .
it 's a huge place , with the bar & separate dining area downstairs and a lounge & more formal dining upstairs .
no apology or explanation , just a bad attitude .
but the beer was disappointing .
it is about $ 11 or $ 12 and trust me , you can easily get full on what they offer .
is it just me or is lighting just crap at every hotel ?
the decor was done very nicely , but they ruined it with the lighting .
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
could n't drink but beer menu looked awesome too .
great food and drinks !
i asked for a manager and after an extended wait had to ask again . finally he showed up .
so cute , the food is good , and atmosphere is mellow .
what was i thinking paying $ 34 for fast food . never again , .
they did a great job on the interior . the coolest on e. 4th .
it 's annoying and distracting .
the interior design appears to be done by a blind person from the 80s .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
because there were no other customers except my table , the servers were just hanging at the tables and talking very loud .
i love their pineapple vodka drink . great for a date night .
the bartenders are friendly and attentive , the drinks poured well and quite tasty .
this place is reasonably expensive , by saying so that means they earned whatever they charged you .
and also we asked for some of their mocktails ( but with alcohol ) and they were just as fabulous .
sushi in general is expensive here , given that we live in a landlocked area -- but , i consider this one of the only acceptable options here worthy of my $ $ $ !
first experience today and it was great .
i guess we should n't be surprised since the hotel was pretty empty too .
i have n't even received my food yet and feel the need to share my experience . the manager is loudly complaining to her crew members about their performance and took my order in an incredibly rude manner .
were more successful in terms of harmony and balance of the flavors .
they have a full bar , a nice draft list , and an array of bottled and canned beers .
do not recommend it . bathrooms very dirty looked like someone threw up in the men 's sink .
awesome for happy hour - great deals on food and drink .
the atmosphere is lively and inviting , encouraging parties of all kinds and numbers to enjoy a grand meal .
not bad for $ 5 .
i found that having ripped wallpaper in the halls and the design around the room outdated .
it was scream across the table and barely be understood kind of loud . it was `` i wish they 'd turn it from from building shaking to just ear splitting '' kind of loud . it was just give up and write notes on a napkin kind of loud .
i opted out of agave nectar on top and it was already plenty sweet .
prices are great as well .
so glad we stopped by !
it would have been okay , if i would have had some sauce on my sesame chicken , but to no avail dry .
glasses start at 9 $ ... and you could get a decent bottle for 45 $ this is a great place for groups , as you can share your food with everyone .
great food and drinks !
i do n't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible .
plus , it 's the place is very easily accessible and prices are very fair .
excellent service on a friday night .
some good food on my vegas trip .
it tasted great . not too salty and not too overpowering .
we had been wanting to go to the block & grinder since it opened and we heard some great things .
unfortunately , i am not a craft beer drinker , but they did had a very large beer selection .
it was still cold but not as bad .
there is no signage explaining how this works , so when you do the normal process of ordering then walking to the register , you 'll be told to pay when you 're finished .
the check showed the price from $ 11 original price jumped to $ 20 .
and then it was only because we flagged someone down .
the chicken was dry and not at all flavorful . the nachos were okay .
ordered a beer in the bottle as they only had the typical `` crap '' in my opinion on draft .
i hate it when hot dogs are just boiled and rubbery .
i immediately ordered the basil gimlet and it was a great starter cocktail , light and really refreshing .
it 's a good spot for breakfast . and reasonably priced .
too creepy for me .
in addition to the beer k and i also ordered some happy hour food .
anyway , i took advantage of the happy hour beer specials , but unfortunately i really hated the second beer ( something by deschutes that i think might have been skunked ) .
the men 's restroom was filthy with water or something on the floor .
and did i mention that the margarita was very weak ? i think the bartender forgot the tequila .
the crust is n't too thick or thin ; just right . it had perfect amount of chewiness to it as well .
the interior looks not too bad .
this place has a cute little patio if you want some sunshine too .
the other sushi was just bland .
it was alright , but the chicken had no mexican flavor at all . other person had pork tacos , which were bombed with cilantro and the pork was pretty tough .
their chicken shawarma was the most delicious and juicy chicken i have ever tried . somehow they pack the chicken with the best most mouth watering flavor i 've had .
it fed 5 people well for under $ 50 - not bad !
i usually get a beer and as much as i enjoy a cold mug of beer i do wish i could get a cold pint glass of beer .
amazing skewers , best we 've had .
they were kind enough to fix their mistakes , but it took another 30 min for the corrected food to come out .
not as strong of a dr pepper taste as i was expecting , but still a good flavor .
finished off with paan shots which were very good .
the food took forever to come out ( 30 minutes or so ) and the balance of noodles to sauce to veggies and chicken was off because it was prepared in the to-go container rather than on a plate .
especially when they have the grapefruit sculpin !
the homemade ranch was really good as well you ca n't tell the difference !
patient with me and my love as we had never been here before .
food is mediocre at best for what they charge .
good prices for japanese food , and pretty fresh for the price .
came here for lunch for an ayce at $ 18 once and i thought that 's a pretty good price .
they have a full bar with decent selection of beers on tap , by the bottle and wine .
i gave this one a three stars mostly because we ordered a pitcher or margarita and honestly i did not taste any tequila .
the price is reasonable too !
the margarita was n't anything special either .
service upstairs was poor , one waiter tried to handle the majority of the tables .
they could use a face lift , but the food makes up for the outdated interior .
i love this restaurant 's low-key , cool vibe and ambience .
the staff was great .
i think if i had ordered more `` orange chicken '' type of dishes , i would be less satisfied .
clean and very nice staff
from the baked brie , mussels , savory salmon on a crisp potato pancake , to the fabulous wine selection ... we love everything . the wines are fresh and delightful .
i 'm sure this place is good most days , but my experience here was not good especially if my bill is nearly $ 300 not including tip .
i ate at benjamin 's in nyc last week for about $ 125 a person and i 'd gladly pay $ 300 for that meal again before i paid $ 100 for this meal .
pricing was a bit high for the food .
i thought the tap list was great even though i did n't have a beer .
interesting , exciting and delish food combinations .
service remains top notch ; something you would expect from a much more expensive restaurant .
a great steak wo n't cost you $ 50+ here either .
it 's a beautiful restaurant - perhaps have a have drink there but would n't recommend eating there .
it might sound weird , but check out the bathrooms .
one of my new favorite places to eat !
the management more than redeemed themselves with their excellent service and attention to us .
price is good too .
there were also lots of tv screens so it had a good sporty atmosphere without being too bar-like .
when we kindly asked for a manager to explain how we were treated , we were completely dismissed .
the good , atmosphere , menu & service was great . i had the fried cheese curds , which were excellent .
if you order up to $ 30 the crab is only $ 9 and in the afternoon if you order up to $ 30 the lobsters are only $ 15 !
location is great some art work around building .
my fiancé and i also had a coupon for a free appetizer . we got the lobster and shrimp dip which was awesome .
do n't get me wrong , the food was not bad , but it did n't feel like anything stellar .
the food is decent and fairly cheap .
i could even hear them yelling at each other for a bit while sitting at my table . maybe just a bad day ?
the drinks were good .
although their all you ca n't is only $ 25 for dinner .
but there 's not a whole lot of substance to hold up all that pretentious vibe .
good food and reasonable prices .
had three varieties , all very fresh .
the 2 bottled beers were quite good though .
after 10 minutes we were finally seated and after we ordered the food , it took a long time for the food to come .
and it 's cheap !
prices are great as well .
as for the food , portions were great considering the pretty affordable prices .
i absolutely love gecko grill . their chips with bean dip and choice of salsas are amazing .
go for the experience , however order minimal food !
for under $ 25 , it was a great value .
we also enjoyed the free house margarita for checking in on yelp and a few $ 5 happy hour margaritas as well .
i 'm no decor expert by any means , but i did n't care for the fake plants and the furniture was lawn chairs .
i called them right away but the woman answering my call did n't believe me and hung up on me . `` it 's shredded '' she said .
i absolutely loved the succulent lobster .
the dining room itself was cute and played : roger and zapp , 50 cent , marvin gaye ; all over the place , yet nostalgic . overall great experience .
if you just want to try it out , but not sure you want to spend $ 22 for dinner , go there for lunch for $ 16 a person .
do n't bother going , unless you just want the flashing lights and loud animals .
weird that the men 's one person bathroom has a big gap in the door .
the ambience however is gorgeous . just wish the food taste matched the atmosphere and presentation .
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
i only had beer .
but the service is poor .
the only problem is its on the westside of town and i 'm in henderson .
the texture and flavors are amazing in each bite .
the portions are huge and nothing short of amazing .
very cute and colorful , and the man who greeted us and served us was super friendly .
we had some happy hour drinks and apps and everything we ate and drank was really good .
food is always good and plenty of it - veggies always fresh .
chill place and great vibe .
i found the burger meat to be tasteless and very greasy .
cool little place to catch up with a friend or date over some sweetness .
the burgers are very good and well seasoned . the onion rings were great .
not bad for $ 10 i was disappointed with the limited food menu . the only non appetizer on the menu was a burger or 3 chicken sliders .
a plethora of negative signs : `` bathrooms only for patrons . ''
a nice , quiet mom and pop sort of sushi spot .
the noddles were dry and the chicken was even drier .
service was good and attentive .
cocktail of choice for the evening was the persian and it was light and refreshing .
our order took forever to get to us when there was only 2-3 other tables occupied ( whom already received their food ) .
not sure who 's idea the ceiling was but that 's pretty cool .
rolls are fresh and good .
prices are very reasonable . the most expensive breakfast combo is $ 8.45 .
good food , poor service .
and the price of the food are reasonable .
however the lighting was so bad that i felt like i was eating in a dungeon .
the potato salad had good flavor and great textures .
the food and drinks were great i had the head off shrimp and blueberry daiquiri .
for the price it 's pretty cheap .
it was good , but nothing stood out to be amazing , memorable , or different . the chickery sauce was good , and the smashed potatoes i thought were ok , again nothing memorable .
beer wise , stick to bottles .
the patio is nicely shaded from the hot vegas sun and allows you to stare at passersby on the strip .
the outdoor patio is cute and a nice place to enjoy a meal .
we went here based on the yelp review for awesome looking food and oysters .
they did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it 's not all about crappy beer .
the cocktails were as delicious as the were strong .
it is a pretty cool environment as well with a friendly vibe .
but worse than the food was the poor lighting in this new place . horrible florescent bulbs give the place the look of a morgue .
i must say , very friendly people .
total came to $ 32 , not bad at all .
plus they had a riesling named harper : )
lets not forget the decoration that is ugly as well .
the only issue have with the airport is the $ 8 per day extended parking cost .
not bad and they had a great selection of beers on tap and mixed drinks and wine .
fair price , decent service , and delicious tacos .
my favorite drink here was red sangria and it was so good that our group in total had about 15 glass of just this drink : ) .
not sure why some say the decor was upscale .
only thing `` nola '' was tacky beads on the lighting .
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
taste was mediocre and nothing special .
i 'm moving to this neighborhood and this will be one of my new favorite spots ! they have a great deli selection and you can buy some groceries as well .
the onion combination with the malai kabob was heavenly , because the lemon pieces were generous , making the basmati rice and chicken sparkle with flavor and tenderness . the four pieces of naan were scrumptious .
usually we are greeted immediately and receive quick and excellent service .
i then switched to beer - they have a pretty good beer list available , too .
beers are only available by the bottle , oddly enough .
sucks for pictures , pretty dark .
ordered a beer in the bottle as they only had the typical `` crap '' in my opinion on draft .
the decor was a little weird though . very colorful , but the themes do n't match up .
the goofy objects , menus , and posters on the walls come of a genuinely quirky and not played up .
so you have to pay for the full serving for the unique flavors and a lot of them range $ 25+ which is kind of ridiculous .
to top it off no draft beer in the theater only the bar ?
i only had beer .
the only thing that i wish was different was that they had a sherbet flavor .
the staff was nice and attentive .
our server was very friendly and attentive .
i can always rely on smiles and great food in a hurry from this location . the owner is so nice and every employee i 've encountered here has been positive and professional .
first , the decor - yes , it 's all about nacho libre with not only images of masked wrestlers on the walls , but the taps were masked too .
it 's a good place with decent food at equally decent prices .
finally , the hot and sour soup was not spicy or sour at all .
i ordered another drink as the beer flight was hardly anything .
lots of crab and shrimp for a cheap price . amazing variety of food .
very disappointing . it 's the simplest dish .
the price was reasonable .
price is decent , well for vegas .
i 've noticed the service is not so great on sunday nights , but on friday and saturday nights it is a well run operation .
only negative , not many beers on tap , we ordered three times before we got a beer listed that they actually had on tap : (
tried calling in an order tonight as i was driving but no dice , they wanted a credit card # up front . as i finally ordered in the store i pointed out to the cashier that this was n't fun and got crickets ... .
around 5:00 pm , an acoustic duo began performing , and the crowd shuffled in . in no time , we were all engaged by listening to some great acoustic hits .
my new favorite hookah spot . i would def recommend getting there early , they get super busy .
great value for the price .
my only issue was that i ordered a chicken wrap and it literally had about 1oz of chicken .
the one thing i thought a little unusual was that they served beer , had a couple of taps and some bottled craft beers listed on a chalkboard .
the prices were fair - not real cheap or expensive .
looked like they had a good selection of beer on tap , even though i did n't have any .
the selection was very poor as far as bottled beers and what was on tap .
and a super price .
the portion size was huge !
any time a server delivers your margarita with , `` i 'm a terrible bartender because i like drinking too much .
nice ambiance , reasonable prices , and very good food .
i liked the atmosphere of the whole restaurant .
for the entrees i got the chicken tikki masala , and my friends with me got the lamb curry and vegetable korma .
i was unimpressed with tapas 51. the lighting was extremely bright , reminding me of the interrogation rooms on tv .
the decor is tacky but thats what i love about this place .
my favorite is the weston burger , but there are many others that i want to try .
i had the gyro lunch special and it came with frys .
the wine list was impressive and our bottle of wine was by far my favorite part of dining here .
the service is great when the snowbirds are n't in town .
the atmosphere of the shop can be kind of awkward because of the bad lighting and awkward silences .
they had a nice happy hour , but we were n't drinking .
we got the champagne brunch , not a bad value for $ 32 per person .
they had a good selection of bottled beers but nothing on tap .
the infused waters are complementary though larger glasses and ice would be nice .
which was perfect . it took away some of the sweetness of a mojito and gave it a bit more body .
at $ 30 the brunch is justified of the price .
did i mention great food ?
the place is nice and cheery with a lovely upbeat atmosphere .
the high price and small quantity of food leave a lot to be desired . honestly , the food is n't horrible , but the price is far too high for the quality and quantity paid for .
i normally go to the other bachi burger closer to the strip , so i tried this one since it 's closer to where we are staying .
the food was awesome ! our server aj was very helpful and friendly .
it 's $ 14 and while pricey i enjoyed it .
price was moderate for lunch .
start with a martini ( gin , vermouth , olive ) and enjoy a good experience .
so fresh and cooked perfectly !
however , the famous frozen hot chocolate tasted like burnt plastic , not good at all !
the prices are great .
good food at reasonable price .
even one of the draft beers was bad !
it 's older and seems wore out . what drove me crazy was how thin the walls are , i could hear phone conversations , toilets flushing , and the guy snoring all night .
a classy wine bar that serves 1 or 2 scallops in a martini glass as an appetizer should use fresh lemon juice .
it was really creepy .
the woman replied with a ( kinda rude ) manner : '' so here i am , '' while she feet were rooted beside the cashier .
in any case , the chicken and rice were both fairly unmemorable , as well as a bit expensive .
it 's very cute and friendly , the food is excellent , wine menu is limited by the glass so i had to drink a whole bottle .
beer and wine was unlimited , but they were serving only one type of beer .
the price is incredible , i ordered a huge meal and with delivery , tax and tip it was only $ 19 .
servers are often complaining about how they work so hard and get minimum wage .
pizza slices are pretty descent but their snack fries is great just right amount of crunch and savory topping .
recommend any day for a wonderful evening with a bottle of wine .
loved the atmosphere and the decor on the first floor .
even the bathrooms felt classy ( this is important , let 's be honest ) !
i had the curry chicken and a beef patty today . no complaints on my patty , but the chicken was n't anything special .
fast , reasonably priced , and delicious .
it is cheap , fast and so good .
i really enjoyed the massaman curry with duck and a delicious thai flavored coconut curry sauce .
prices were reasonable too .
the decor looks like someones grandmothers home - who was blind - and had bad taste in wallpaper .
i though the peach drink i got was excellent , if a bit small .
i am starving and still waiting . the waitress actually had the nerve to ask me if i wanted another drink cause i finished mine while this excruciatingly long wait for my brunch - should totally be offering me free drinks during this ridiculous wait
compared to many avon lake bars this one has a cheerful and fun vibe .
bad service . bad food .
also , good selection of beer , 15 tap beers and about that many in a bottle .
you get plenty of food for a cheap price !
price was pretty good for the selection .
loved the menu item choices .
price for two : $ 30 . a small joint with only two tables , great for take out .
i do n't understand why the previous cashier made it more difficult than it had to be .
for $ 36 it was a colossal rip off compared to even the other bad all you can eat places .
sip this on a warm afternoon on the patio with a friend .
went at an `` off hour '' yes , but no excuses , not good .
this place has been great !
it 's so awkward and uncomfortable and all conversation is obliterated by the sound .
pretty good wine selection i guess , i 'm not a wine guy . not much of a beer selection for being a beer and wine bar .
we started with the sweet chili calamari .
the interior is lovely and the staff is pleasant .
i love greek food and they do not disappoint . i like the 1/2 chicken !
there were the normal beer options ( no craft ) and the wine was barefoot so nothing to write home about .
it 's also generally not super busy thus a good place to hang out with friends and talk without having to yell over loud music . i would recommend the friday zombie .
try the deluxe , it 's heaven on a plate
i know most beer drinkers prefer piss like corona and budweiser and heineken , but us beer snobs are kind of left in the cold it seemed .
surprised i have n't reviewed this spot yet . loved coming here when i used to work nearby and it beat going to food truck friday because the crowd was significantly smaller .
only thing was the price - most of the entrees on the menu were in the $ 10 to 13 range .
i like the atmosphere the most , it 's clean yet cozy , intimate yet always buzzing with people coming and going , i love sitting out on the patio and watching people and cars go by .
good selection of beer , wine ... not at all .
i am glad they open early because they close around 4 .
between all the curries , the pork katsu is my favorite . decent sized portions and crispy katsu .
they have a lot of reasonably priced variety .
the only thing i did n't like was the garlic bread .
i dont think people should spend $ 50 for dinner and get that kind of result .
i am more of a beer drinker than liquor drinker , and while there were only a few beers on tap , it was a good variety .
patio was nice but it ends there .
yes unhealthy bar food - but tasty and cheap . drinks are good .
i got a beer sampler and a couple of the beers were ok , but nothing really impressive .
newly remodeled room was awesome . clean , comfortable , and quiet .
pick something the counter ordering then being waited on is really awkward .
the whole experience just made me uncomfortable .
i 've been meaning to check out nami for a while now so we finally popped in this past sunday as we are doing a vegan challenge .
we paid $ 16 dollars at that time for lunch which is not too bad .
i referred steak frites to someone who grew up in montreal and they took their family and everyone loved it .
i shared with my husband the steamed clams with a wine and butter broth ( super delish ) and also a combo pan roast . the combo pan roast was excellent the seafood was fresh we had ours spicy level 6 ( perfect number its spicy but its not overpowering ) .
if you 're looking for a burger from a chain restaurant this is an excellent pick !
the negative aspect of this restaurant and my only complaint was the lighting and lack of privacy .
if the entrees were $ 2 cheaper , it 'd be about right .
the atmosphere was ok ... a little too bright , they could probably lower the recessed lighting ... the lanterns above the tables seemed fairly bright .
place is clean with good portions and well priced .
very nice , calming decor .
tuna tartar was beautiful to start and the omelet with gruyere was great .
my my `` some things with mrs. p 's ) drink was refreshing and made to order , less sweet .
( oops , but a happy accident . )
the wine list is also amazing and they have delicious cocktails as well .
one thing though : the small space made it difficult to hear my former professor who does not speak with a loud voice .
the rice was ok. the cube toast was pretty good .
the margarita and the watermelon daiquiri were both winners ... especially in 109 degree weather we split a bbq chicken salad which was great .
they always have some kind of infused vodka that is to die for .
our party of four split a $ 14 bottle of wine which gave each of us a pretty generous glass and it made it super cheap for us to enjoy a great glass of wine with dinner .
service was exceedingly nice and very welcoming , especially for a somewhat fast food environment .
nice atmosphere -- we dined on the patio on a very comfortable sofa .
i like the atmosphere , the converted house is beautiful , and the baristas are friendly .
tap water there is terrible but is kind of necessary when drinking cocktails .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
the egg roll was good , but the fried rice was very bad ( super salty , kind of tasted like feet ) .
the wine decent , but i paid $ 12-18 per glass !
viet kitchen is not for vegetarians . the food do n't taste good , kitchen is not clean , service is bad , when you enter the restaurant before half an hour of the closing time , the waitress may yell at you and say they are cleaning the kitchen .
the decor looks like someones grandmothers home - who was blind - and had bad taste in wallpaper .
from the gray carpeting to the dull green walls , the cheap fixtures , the lack of art or music to the so-so food and slow service this place can best be described as dull , bland and boring mixed with no ambience at all .
the owner is always out to talk to customers and likes to ensure you enjoyed her food . the vegan sushi is an amazing addition to their menu .
prices are very reasonable .
its only taste for malaysian .
selection of drinks is excellent and the wine list is amazing .
for $ 50 it was fine for 1 night , but it was depressing .
this review is for the 3 course lunch special for $ 20.12 , which will change in price every year .
not sure who 's idea the ceiling was but that 's pretty cool .
and if you are handicapped - only one person may go in with you - the rest of your party can wait until they are called .
the salad recipes are excellent .
do n't bother with dollar margarita tuesdays . they 're so syrupy it 's impossible to drink an entire glass .
tip though : not a place to go to have a conversation or go to on a date unless you wan na be yelling at the top of your lungs haha but an excellent atmosphere to go to with friends to have fun and dive into food/drinks : )
the price is also very fair .
i also tried the soursop drink and it was so good , it tasted like strawberry , watermelon , kiwi , and passion fruit had a delicious baby juice in my cup .
we had margaritas and beer , and the beer was the only thing with any alchohol content .
husband had the beef teriyaki which was a very generous portion served with soup , salad , and rice . i had the chicken sukiyaki which was huge .
it 's not uncommon for total strangers to just strike up a random conversation .
however , it 's still a casino , which means creepy drunk people , scantily clad performers , and an overall mess of people .
plus they have a great wine list .
it was pretty sad .
we just ca n't justify going there any more when there are comparable clubs that are more reasonably priced .
it has a really awesome mural and ambient lighting .
my favorite roll , lemon roll !
nice decor , nice ambiance , terrific food .
the tonkatsu was oily , to the point where i could n't finish it and that was despite being starving and wanting tonkatsu really badly .
will never order from this place again horrible service !
the blonde with the glasses was awesome . she recommended the grapefruit cocktail and it was perfect .
they also came with some fried onion straws ( again , good taste , very greasy ) and some macaroni and cheese ( i did n't think it was dry , like others have mentioned , but it was very bland ) .
he came , was especially disinterested in the insulting remark we had been handed .
small criticism : the lighting was a little harsh , but as i did takeout ( and lighting is n't all together that important ) , this does n't really count as much of a negative in my mind .
atmosphere for dining not great due to being in the casino with views of slot machines and noise of quarters hitting their metal trays .
service was only ok. we waited for drinks and to order .
it presented well , with nice plating .
the waitress served us today is really rude and mean . the whole dining experience is disgusting
the mushroom was very good but the sausage tasted like sysco sausage and the marinara tasted like canned tomato sauce and was very runny .
it is pricey though at $ 30 something bux but really good pizza is hard to find !
but the service was atrocious .
the beer is cold and i have mixed drinks about feelings .
i know credit is much more expensive for businesses to accept than debit , but it 's super inconvenient . maybe i 'm just being difficult , but it 's how i pay for everything .
why does a business that normally specializes in hospitality provide absolutely none ?
they chill then liquor to make it thick and syrupy bringing some nice caramel , bourbon and gingerbread flavours out .
upon checking in i tried the sandwich trick - it totally worked and i got upgraded to a very nice room in the fantasy tower with the biggest tub i 've ever seen , 3 tv 's , a walk in closet , huge bathroom , etc .
we had to pay the entire bill , even though we had invested in 4 coupons for this restaurant .
the employees were very friendly and attentive .
it appears they are using a frozen onion and bell pepper blend now . it does not grill right , and stays very wet .
obviously , the idea of eliminating waitstaff by transferring ordering to the cashier is a failure ( i was not the only one to leave without ordering ) .
it 's got some weird industrial theme going on , but it does n't feel too dirty .
the pancakes where edible but nothing special .
also the bathroom was kind of messy with paper towels strewn all over the floors .
although the folks at the bar did n't even ask if i wanted something to drink while i waited for my order . but besides that all was good .
the place is small , but super cozy and cute inside .
so if you 've been paying attention , we were asked three different times to be waited on and every time we said no thank you , it was very obvious they were annoyed .
i loved this place .
price tag was just about right , coming to $ 5 + tip . ( i like to tip ! )
they have a small menu , but everything looks good and is priced extremely reasonably .
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
they 've got a good selection of appetizers ( order the meatballs ) and the wine was great . michael is very knowledgeable about wine .
the marinara sauce was alright , was n't too good to me . the pizza was obviously small , but the sauce was a bit too sweet .
such a delicious , healthy and colorful blend of food .
but when you are spending so little on food , it 's easy to justify spending more on drinks .
there is a variety of prices for each burrito ( $ 6-12 ) but seems to be a bit expensive for the size .
they have a nice patio for outside dining and an awesome staff .
expensive , about $ 10 .
the decor and ambiance is dreadful .
it was right under $ 20 .
we go at least once a month . someday i 'm going to try their sunday only cinnamon bun .
we did n't try any cocktails , but the beer selection was n't too bad .
now onto the food ... my lobster roll was a huge disappointment ... it was waaaaay too salty and i could n't taste any lobster taste at all ... it was just drenched in butter and sauce .
prices are n't cheap , but are decent for what you get .
menu is varied , service was great .
the bottled beer was n't as cold as we like it .
it 's cheap , but that 's about it .
the tiny take-away counter is so cute and has ample patio seating out front making this a great summertime destination .
everything served was so fresh . i also ordered a seaweed salad which was excellent .
there was a $ 5.00 ( $ 3.00 should be the maximum ) corkage fee on the menu , so i am assuming hat you can bring your own bottle .
our room was dirty , mostly the bathroom . the counter was dirty , there was hair in the tub and pee on the toilet !
and the place is reasonably priced to boot .
the masala dosa at udipi is filled with a mixture of spiced mashed potatoes and onion , and served with sambar and coconut chutney . delicious .
the food is way better than on the strip and my bill was cheap .
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
we each only took one bite and my husband declared that it tasted like something you 'd get from the freezer section at wal mart .
nachos with chicken is the best one i 've had yet .
first , the service is amazing . our waitress kept our drinks full ( we purchased the 2 for 1 unlimited drinks ) , we drank the rum punch all night on her recommendation .
a nice surprise for me was that they make a sangria with white wine , which was very refreshing and peachy .
normally we would n't complain , but at $ 60 for a steak i expect top notch .
the beer selection was n't bad .
awesome hot dog place . i love the grilled hot dogs and they have , hands down , the best onion rings !
the first time i was here i remember everything to be outstanding .
he loves the buffalo chicken pizza and i love the cheese pizza .
perfect blend of authentic mexican flavors and textures with a bit of a hawaiian twist .
food is alright , nothing terribly impressive , but still good .
our server was very pleasant and entertained everyone at the table .
including us , there were only 6 customers .
i visitors this restaurant with my fiancée for dinner , hoping to eat some great poutine .
the wait staff was attentive and the cocktail i picked ( long island ice tea ) was strong and well mixed .
the restaurant has a large interior , as well as a large patio -- i honestly do n't know why people would want to eat anywhere except the patio , as it is prime seating for the fountains an for people watching !
its just a nice place to hang out .
no good . clean but weird decor .
there is so much hot sauce and other items in the rolls that you do n't notice the fish you are eating is n't meant to be consumed raw .
they were only good for light beer even thought they said any domestic beer .
the price is right too .
the lunch specials included a drink which was nice because the prices are high .
they also have a number of good and reasonably priced drinks .
the meat and sauce were good however the noodles were very hard .
the prices are reasonable .
they had some beer of draft so that was cool , just mexican beer though which is n't very exciting .
the only 2 beers available was budlight and `` house special beer '' which tasted like piss water .
food is decent , reasonably priced . the soup is great .
we got the large pizza and wings combo with the pino sticks to start . the pino sticks were great and the hot wings were great too .
like the dark knight ; ) you know what i mean !
the lamb was dry , it tasted like a raw lamb without any seasoning . the filet was soggy , undercooked and it tasted like they dumped condensed beef broth on it .
they nickel and dime you for everything ... $ 1.79 for a breadstick ! they use to be $ 1.00 ... crazy !
good food , waiter was a little abrasive about what we were ordering .
our server was very sweet and let us know of their happy hour deals - which were great !
has a family-friendly vibe during the day but turns into a cool night spot .
no complaints on not having a full glass of beer .
the soup , salad , and pasta ( with tip and tax ) cost about $ 16 , so i expect a decent meal at this price .
did n't get a drink but looked like a nice selection of beers on tap .
our event included some appetizers ( a couple kinds of pizza and bruschetta ) , which were pretty good too . the bartender was happy to create some kind of pretty non-alcoholic juice cocktail for me .
i thought it would be hard and tough to eat but it was soft and flavorful .
my favorite by far is the peach lemonade . yummy ca n't stop drinking them .
first of all , it 's very loud and trendy .
buffet was great ! only around $ 9 and can get a drink for 95 cent .
chicken samosa and green chutney is awesome .
my meal was amazing and highlighted the skills of the kitchen : meat cooked perfectly , a sweet cherry reduction that complimented the pork and those veggies !
cheap ok wines by the glass .
we started with a drink at the bar which was nice .
but then ... - jerk chicken : dry chicken filling , sauce on the side was just ok. have tasted much better jerk flavoured sauces .
we will more than likely not come here again .
they omelets are enormous and very delicious !
it 's a really nice place to stay at with a great ambiance and great looking people everywhere . the pools are real fun , especially the lazy river .
the waitstaff is friendly , the atmosphere is great with interesting architecture , and you can go upstairs afterwards to get some milk cookies !
this restaurant is an amazing option for an area of town underserved by good restaurants .
the breads and cheeses were a great combination with the dried fruits and nuts .
the decor was neat . i liked the dollar bills on the walls , though this might be a turnoff for some .
people think i may be crazy purchasing a $ 38 pizza but who can put dollars ( and sense ) to outstanding quality .
the bread for the sandwich was perfect .
good wine list and service .
definitely a must for a happy hour !
no table cloths , fake candles on the table and a rest room that is like one in a applebee 's .
it 's right off the light rail which is a plus .
( maybe it 's a kind of place that inspires calm conversations ? )
they have a good and unique vegetarian selection .
ok one weird thing - in the men 's restroom is a urinal that looks like a horse trough .
the people there showed very little interest in customer service .
a bit pricey but not outrageous .
the layout is kind of odd though .
i would get that whole order under $ 10 in united states , considering the conversion rate , the cost should able atleast below $ 15 .
the waitress from `` georgia '' was rude from the start like we were an inconvenience to her .
try to request a table downstairs , where you can watch the bar , sit in cute little curtained nooks , and feel the bustle that is so authentically new orleans .
had the fried chicken skins , turkey burger , mac and cheese , ny strip , carbonara , and meatballs and they were all great .
the bad : everything lacked flavor from start to finish . our app the bruschetta was horrible , from the taste and texture to the balsamic that was `` artistically '' swirled in the center .
the decoration and interior really suck unfortunately .
delicious at a reasonable price .
no draft beer , but a decent choice of cans and bottles .
$ 21 pizza is kind of insane in this area .
we did n't try any beer but the beer list was impressive .
then at the cash register , the cashier did n't even say hi or thank you and totally just stared at me .
i only had beer .
had the crab/shrimp panini w/the side salad ... both were delicious but the panini was supreme . the bread tasted homemade and the portion of tasty seafood inside was fairly generous .
drinks are incredible . great drink list and skilled bartender , which is a huge bonus for me .
service was great , drinks were on point ( i had the sake sangria ) , but food was terrible .
get some beer and mussels . and the fries are also perfect .
but only for beer .
only negative , music got a little loud .
we stumbled upon this gem this morning and i 'm so glad we did !
ordered delivery , they said about 45 minutes , not bad considering it was dinner hour on a saturday evening , food got here in about 30 minutes ... ..food got here , and it was pretty delicious tasting .
i highly recommend the blood orange margarita ( or the cucumber , which is very refreshing ) .
the soup was grainy , bland and unimpressive .
i do n't drink beer but the waitress said they had a good selection .
some lady by the name of carrie seriously has the most horrendous customer service i have ever experienced . so rude and blatantly disrespectful .
they have a great cocktail menu .
perfect portions and the menus lit up . so cool !
the message was `` i spoke to the owner , you 're the only ones who complained , and he 's not going to take anything off your bill so we ca n't refund you either . ''
the place is reasonably priced with decent enough seating .
the place has a calm energy with fresh and comfortable vibe .
the slider was cold and when asked for a new one , i think they just reheated the same one .
the ugly : nothing too ugly here neutral : no seating , purely a takeout joint .
was not good at all - should have listened to the waittress on the peanut butter chocolate thing .
food and price is decent .
the ugly : it 's worn .
beer was just not good .
the prices are pretty good too .
the place is n't cheap , so expect to pay at least $ 60 a head , but service is very professional and the drinks are satisfying .
the only thing i was n't a fan of was the lighting .
we did n't try any beer but the beer list was impressive .
the atmosphere was ok ... a little too bright , they could probably lower the recessed lighting ... the lanterns above the tables seemed fairly bright .
unfortunately they only have a few mixed drinks , beers , and wines - no full bar .
we only had appetizers but entrees look good.. not a lot of beers on tap but the ones they had were craft beers and were decent choices .
combined with a tall beer made for a great meal .
i decided to try a margarita ( happy hour all day on sunday ) - not super strong but good taste .
it was good but just not enough though for the price you pay .
my calzone was yummy but i ordered a spaghetti calzone since i 'd never heard of it and there was n't any spaghetti in it so ... idk what was supposed to be different .
i even once tried a pretty awesome jalapeno margarita but honestly i would rather drink the beer .
my friends ordered cocktails and they were n't thrilled about their drinks .
service is mediocre but they try to charge fine dining prices !
we went to hanks for happy hour after the pool and enjoyed the martinis and tuna tacos .
we started our meal with the antipasto platter - an absolute steal at the price they are charging - served on a nice wooden board with buffalo mozzarella cheese , genoa salami , prosciutto , artichokes , marinated olives , grilled vegetables & toasted garlic baguette .
excellent food , perfect drinks , and fantastic service ! : - ) - we will be back with friends !
the food was fantastic , the ambiance is truly romantic and old world beautiful .
what 's up with the uncomfortable metal chairs ?
friendly staff and airy space . wonderful place in scottsdale !
the waitstaff is top notch and the vibe is hip without being pretentious .
food was good , but expect to spend $ $ $ .
it 's cheap and delicious .
all for quite cheap .
the food was very tasty and very reasonably priced .
their food is not cheap .
so delicious ! love the pork sliders , the perfect size and the buns are soft and warm .
i do n't even care about the bright lighting or off decor ( or there lack of ) .
drinks were also really good , i had a mule and also a champagne cocktail- both were tasty and went down a little too easy .
had nachos which were surprisingly meh . bar tap choice was kind of limited , and they did n't have all on tap .
i also had a glass of fresh orange juice which was perfect , without pulp !
an overhead ceiling fan would have made the entire difference ... just a note .
we were there at lunch may be why it was cold by time it got to us at table .
cool atmosphere , good service .
alas , no dice . the sausages were legitimate nasty , the toast subpar , the eggs just eh , and the potatoes just ... like cut up boiled potatoes that were slightly fried .
convenient location , attractive setting .
it hardly had any toppings on it and had very little taste .
the fried leeks on top added a great flavor element .
the explanation in the little `` true food '' book about the decor and the feng shui was a little pretentious , but whatever .
there 's a great deal of quality and its portion for the price you pay .
the prices are reasonable and the food was pretty good .
looked like they had a good selection of beer on tap , even though i did n't have any .
good food and wine for 20 dollars .
great beer and wine selection and an excellent manhattan .
the best thing about this place is the prices , they are very reasonably priced .
great restaurant ! definitely lives up to the hype with outstanding pei oysters , decadent lobster spaghetti , delicious cod fish with five different kinds of sauteed onions - as well as a perfectly cooked filet mignon .
really simple food but also really cheap and tasty .
the price is right at $ 35 and to top it off you can add endless mimosas for $ 8 .
prices are not too bad , for a club and a burger ( no drinks ) it 's about $ 18 .
it was disgusting.. the cook never uses gloves . the worst kebab it was.. never use washroom it was full of napkins and bunch of crap .
the burgers themselves were small , dry and tasteless . the rest of the sandwich was fine and the fries were good .
my wife and i are huge fans of seafood and crawfish .
paintings ) are weird , but i guess they 'd be good ice breakers or conversation starters .
delicious . price is great , but drinks can be a little pricy .
the price is reasonable .
the music was n't the greatest and was n't very danceable , but has a nice lounge feel if you 're into sitting or standing and chatting over a few beers listening to music .
i know you 're busy and probably slammed with orders but to wait an hour for our food when we already waited an hour to be seated is so ridiculous .
the food was delicious .
creative menu though and properly sized portions .
they have a great happy hour with amazing mango mint margaritas .
would highly recommend and look forward to going there again !
i worried that the staff would give us weird looks or somehow treat us differently for showing up sweaty and covered in dust . they did n't .
margs were great ; would recommend the elderflower and jalapeño margarita but even the regular one was great !
the bowls of rice noodles were good and very reasonably priced at $ 7.99 / $ 6.99 .
the waffle was one of ghee best i have tasted and the chicken cooked wonderfully and lightly battered .
our server - katie was very good and patience and full of recommendations .
i still wish i had n't had a moscow mule ( my fridge is now full of ginger beer and my cabinet full of vodka ) .
me va me has always been a go-to for me , whenever i 'm looking for good mediterranean !
the decor is still there- though seems dirty to me , but my boyfriend insists that it is intentional distressing on the artwork . whatever .
sweet potato tots are delicious as well . large portions , delicious burgers !
lighting was harsh too . not exactly sure why it felt that way , but very bright for a restaurant .
i also tried the crispy lemongrass catfish and i have to say , i was very impress on how well made the dish was . there the catfish was fried just right and the herbs , spices , and toppings made it perfect .
the food is pretty good - nothing real fancy , and the prices are okay .
excellent food we went for happy hour . they have a great happy hour menu appetizers and drinks each $ 6.00 .
the truffle pasta was just ok. nothing outstanding about it and so a disappointment considering the price .
this location is very clean and the service is friendly and prompt .
the ambience and location are the only downside considering the price that you pay for the food .
nasty and weak margaritas that were being poured from a bucket . plain entrees .
thought the name meant beer or good drinks . beers were pricey .
talk about a depressing background to your meal .
the prices are extremely affordable .
it was not disappointing !
pretty crappy attitude over a huge $ 7 order .
you definitely can not beat the beer prices over at the original .
the experience i had with tres rios was awesome . i had lamb and duck tacos along with chicken quesadilla , fire !
oh and it 's pretty inexpensive too .
the interior of the place was super cute , dim , rustic ?
the lighting is odd ... it is dim , but not the right kind of dim . it 's not warm lighting it is like fluorescent bulbs dimmed .
prices are really reasonable .
it looked too pretty to eat , the desserts looked like it should be from a fine dining restaurant .
the salsa was also fresh and had a light bite .
at $ 31.00 a night , you ca n't beat that , especially being so close to everything else on the strip . i 'd rather spend $ 31 a night on a room and have more money to have a good time .
but not in a stuffy or silly way .
but if you are staying in bellagio or want the convenience and do n't mind the high price tag .
it was only the skin that tasted like honey and the rest was just plain chicken but reminds me of general tso 's chicken -- without the orange flavoring .
also the waiter was very friendly and helpful .
they never refill drinks , they leave the dirty dishes on your table until you leave , they do n't ask if your food is good or if you would like anything else and as another review noted they do n't ask about dessert which they could increase their sales if they did since they have boba and snow which is good .
beer and wine yes , hard booze no .
i ordered the bronzed salmon and it was super yummy !
the have a nice menu and the price is decent .
wings are also done in the coal oven and covered in caramelized onions . great job guys !
i felt like i was in some college dive bar , not out for a special , $ 100 per person dinner .
i had two beers and the beer was cold .
prices are high but you get what you pay for .
had the burger and some chicken tapas and mixed skewers .
they were delicious and very decently priced .
the wings were awful . they pretty much just drizzled the sauce over them .
i was also kindly given an upgrade and damn , it was the nicest room i have stayed at rio . beautiful restroom , nice room with a nice view of the mountain !
these kids were not paying attention for when their food was ready so the people working there were trying to yell over all the other annoying kids who were talking too loud .
let me elaborate on that , because i do n't mind paying more for handcrafted cocktails- the great quality ingredients and the work deserve a mark up , but $ 15 for wine that fine dining restaurants would n't charge $ 10 for , seems like a stretch .
my bowl is reasonably priced at around $ 6.50 .
had the rare steak pho . meat was mediocre and soup was lacking flavor and little off .
ok so the chicken salad is now 90 % celery good to know .
staff was very friendly !
every dish is so creative and unique from other restaurants .
and even though the hallways scream 1960s , i even liked the low ceilings because i 've never felt so tall .
my grandma used to make pasties for us when i was a kid , so i was pleasantly surprised to find this restaurant in tempe .
$ 2 per taco , not bad ! i was pretty underwhelmed .
the standout was the shishito peppers ( which i always love , but these were extra awesome . )
this place is simple and cozy .
we once had to wait a little longer for our order , which was n't a problem but he gave us a free spring roll to make up for it .
very nice server . he was very attentive and great with my kids .
this place is yummy and reasonably priced .
the restaurant itself is pretty minimal , big paint words like smash and burger all over the walls .
beer choices were weak , wine choices were fine .
ambient lighting is barely adequate after dark and seeing a menu or your food is difficult .
we shared the twice-baked potatoes and they were excellent , as well .
the draft beer selection was lacking but the bottle service was awesome .
but dust , tacky wall art and poorly patched booth seats just ruin the ambiance .
sorry dude not impressed and wo n't go back .
it could easily have been a $ 65.00 dinner downstairs .
$ 22 before tip is pretty steep for a med pizza .
i like this place , but i 'm working on loving it .
the negative aspect of this restaurant and my only complaint was the lighting and lack of privacy .
the wine is also a must have - great pairings !
good food is great food .
the lighting was a bit bright but what you gon na do ? i 'm too full to write a full review .
we also split a very nice bottle of wine which a sommelier helped us select .
not the best , but not the worst .
i ordered the beef tenderloin for dinner and it was awful .
the only downfall is the price of the food according to the price .
this place is awesome .
my drink was more expensive than what i ordered , which was burnt and dry . so !
needless to say we pulled out of the drive through without spending a dime at this establishment .
the facility is clean , the windows sparkle .
price is really reasonable for the quality .
i had a cucumber drink that was so refreshing for summer .
it 's a pretty simple dish that did n't have anything very exciting with it .
the portion is pretty decent for the price too .
a little ridiculous if you ask me .
for the price , this place is a very good deal .
i know most beer drinkers prefer piss like corona and budweiser and heineken , but us beer snobs are kind of left in the cold it seemed .
that said it has reasonable pricing and good size portions . very good beer .
decent prices . pretty good food !
the salmon was good but it could have used more flavoring .
the beer i got ( which was the cheapest on tap besides miller lite ) was not bad .
the lighting was a little bright for dinner but nothing to complain about .
the specials are pretty decent .
let 's not even discuss the thin walls or `` blackout '' curtains .
a bunch of annoying punks as well in the parking lot , drunk as hell talking sh*t. did someone pass out a flyer of this place in the ghetto and skanky side of vegas ?
i went to tell the hostess , in a very calm manner , on the way out the door that we had been waiting 34 minutes and no one had even taken our drink order .
the happy hour menu has a big selection of sushi and a roll wo n't be over $ 6.50 so you can stuff your face for a relatively cheap price !
messed up about 50 % of the order : gave us the wrong drink , then gave us the wrong thing again after `` fixing '' it .
when we went to pay the check , we noticed that it was unusually expensive .
the drinks were incredible and very strong so we may return just for drinks on the deck .
the only thing on the walls was paint .
very cheap for what you pay for .
the quiche was too salty to eat & the turkey salad was soaked in dressing & tasteless with soggy sweet potatoes piled on it .
the staff was polite and nice , but water never got refilled ( they only refilled out water after at least an hour of us being there ) .
the bartender suggested an amazing brandy with a pear in the bottle ... poire williams i think .
nope , they are available for purchase only for $ 28 .
was able to get iced tea to my liking - mostly unsweet with just a tad of sweet tea added to make it drinkable .
good service ! decent sized happy hour menu but the prices are unbeatable !
i have been here before and truly enjoyed the experience .
food : less than mediocre for the price .
sorry , do n't feel comfortable giving 5 stars to a place with dirty floors and sinking ceilings .
four words : happy hour and tapas ! everyday , from 4-6pm , customers can enjoy half-price tapas ( appetizers ) and $ 2 of beer and wine ( by the glass ) .
ambiance kind of sucks .
perfect for date night on the roof .
the 16 dollar serving for the blazing chicken did not taste good at all as well a 16 dollar portion should look like a 16 dollar portion not a 7 dollar portion .
my wife loves this salad , and my soup came in a huge bowl .
there is a `` free fall '' bungee jump that you can watch from the top that 's very entertaining .
good wine and great food at reasonable prices .
the agnolotti looked really pretty when it came out but it was so undercooked it was sad .
men 's room is disgusting and was out of hand soap and paper towels .
we ordered about 6 different items ranging in price from $ 5 to $ 14 and liked every one of them .
this place is a great lunch spot !
he came to check on us and found out about the burger issue and took it off the bill which was really nice for him to do -- hence the 4 star .
any ways the sake bombs were delicious not to mention we had a waiter there that kept bringing out all these crazy shot 's he had concocted .
was disappointed , not lot of selection , sashimi were not fresh and the food was bland ... have had a better ayce with the same price ... the service was nice though .
granted i did n't ask how much the pieces of toro tuna would end up being , but at $ 20 and $ 40 for two ( ? $ ) pieces - that was stupid .
cheap prices . i love this place .
why pay full price .
the seats were pretty close to each other , so it allowed for more intimate conversation .
no tap beer , no blended drinks for a decent margaritas and out of steak for tacos .
overall very cool vibe , great food , and great staff .
nice new place in medina . staff was friendly too .
i normally do n't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature .
the price is also a bit high compared to the competition but that increased price is reflected in the significantly higher quality and selection of food .
delicious food , solid wine list ( i do n't drink beer ; it was my husband 's bday ) , and great service . get into it !
it 's not cheap .
we went to the bathroom to clean up before playing games and the bathroom was trashed no towels dirty toliet paper on the floor , disgusting .
but i thought the beers were mediocre .
the only thing on the walls was paint .
i did n't want the brown meats of the chicken just chicken breast which is the white meat but we got the crappy meat which looking at it 's coloring was the brown meat of the chicken with all the fatty pieces .
absolutely gorgeous patio with lots of nooks , variety of seats , and landscaping .
they still did n't have anything on draft but a good bottle selection .
i found that having ripped wallpaper in the halls and the design around the room outdated .
location is cool- nice part of ohio city .
for me , the cost is not justified by the quality .
the south of the border sandwich was delicious , corn flake crusted french toast rich and hearty and the breakfast burritos filling and enormous .
reasonable prices . all fresh .
priced well and good selection .
beers were $ 1 at the bar which rules , and they had some sort of hefeweizen that tasted good to me .
i also order my daughter a cheese burger that was so over cooked and dry .
really great food here , reasonably priced .
since it was considered happy hour at that time they brought us an extra bottle of sake on the house .
we showed up about 5:50pm and i asked the waitress do we have time to order happy hour specials , she said yes of course .
ambiance kind of sucks .
that was kind of creepy .
the cost of food at the walk-up grill at the water park was beyond expensive ( $ 78 for lunch for 4 ) .
the food is fresh , flavorfull and very reasonably priced . the service is excellent and they make a great $ 3.00 margarita .
happy hour offers $ 20 bottles of wine and a nice selection of appetizers perfect for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike .
husband had the sake sangria and said it was `` just okay '' but quite strong .
i loved the 20s style of architecture it was so cool .
beer selection good but server had no clue .
great food . the taste is authentic for sure .
on the positive side , the building is beautiful , it has super fast elevators and the room was very clean .
i do n't know if the owner changed but the service was horrible .
the burger was delicious with lots of flavorful bacon .
very tiny , trendy , wine spot - went there one night with my boyfriend and we just had wine ( 2 bottles ) but we had a great time .
the entree was decent but tasted a bit bland .
great for a place to swing on by if you do n't want the party to stop !
on nice days sit out side , they have a great patio overlooking the fountain .
the service was terrible the guy at the register was not very friendly and was rude to me . it 's a shame because the boba was good and at a decent price but because of the way i was treated i will never come back here .
: ) the price varies , but you can get a healthy , decent , and filling meal for 10.00 and under .
it was delicious but too oily for me .
the place is relaxed , and our service was very good .
the rice was bland as well so the entire burrito has no flavor . the nachos were full of meat but the very little cheese they placed had not been melted so it was minimal cold cheese .
the mojito w/ extra shot was delicious though .
service is great . the employees are very friendly and helpful .
awesome martinis and good service .
server finally came and told us they ran out of bloody mix . we decided to cancel our order and leave .
had the sake sangria cocktail which was delicious and refreshing in a hot summer night .
it seems like a nice relaxing spot to do some work .
i was not impressed with the wine list .
it totally did n't go with the deco or theme .
good prices as well !
the decor does n't completely mesh , but somehow it 's still cozy .
the only awkward part was the ambiance .
you 've got ta get lucky though at the time you come to this location though .
most ( food ) items are from $ 2-5 . $ 5 cocktails is also awesome .
their new location in my hood at scottsdale and oak is awesome - you wo n't regret your visit !
( only because i 'm really not fond of shell fish of any kind . )
great food . awesome outdoor setting with waterfall and little moat .
the prices are reasonable . the quality of food is good .
only thing is , it is a sports bar , and also packed on friday nights because of their special , so expect it to be quite noisy .
i had a sangria that was delicious !
only time we saw the waiter again is when he brought the check .
this place is such a perfect , family-owned mesa staple and i highly recommend it .
all lunches are $ 4.99 and the food is good .
ordered a bottle of wine as well and the night was awesome .
the chicken wings were awesome , delicious , and super spicy .
i washed it all down with a `` kiwi collins '' from the cocktail menu , and it was great .
the creepy , outdated statues are n't not doing any favors for this place .
this place is really cool !
every dish is well thought out and just magic to the palate .
what a cool spot .
they had a good selection of bottled beers but nothing on tap .
welcome to harrisburg ! loved eating at andy 's burgers in locust and now you are 5 minutes from me !
the music can get way too loud but at least it is good music , and karaoke nights are a hoot .
our drinks were super strong coming from their cocktail menu .
they have a lot of speciality drinks , with different syrups and add-ins , but again no pricing , so you have to assume they are $ $ $ $ .
this was a cool spot .
a guy finally did come out after a few minutes and we tried to order .
the food is very good and the prices are very reasonable for such high quality .
to charge more than 2 dollars for that mess is simply insulting .
the bright fluorescent lights indicate they have nothing to hide . the pho is incredible .
the food is superb with top notch salads and the freshest ingredients .
not horrible pizza but a little bland .
one thing to note : their mimosas are made with a cider and oj , not champagne ... still very delicious !
the 2 bottled beers were quite good though .
a great variety of all kinds of foods .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
it is not and unfortunately , i will now tip accordingly .
quick and pretty cheap and tasty .
the wait staff was amazing and very helpful in explaining how everything worked .
the food is good and the prices are reasonable .
only bummer for me was their bathroom lights = ( i know that may be the style they 're going for but i do n't like it when its dark in there . spooky .
i mean its kinda dark in there so just be careful !
i did n't give it five stars because it was really dark and loud , but it 's such a small intimate space and i 'm not sure how they could improve the darkness without making it less `` swanky '' .
the prices can be a little steep , but for an airport , it 's not all that bad .
super weird flashing lights randomly turn on and sweep over the restaurant .
the fried rice was just not good .
i am usually excepting of honest mistakes like that , but once again there were very few people at the bar and it was only us who were closing out so it just seemed to be more of a case of carelessness and not paying attention .
small bar with awesome wine & beer selections and a fun atmosphere ! not to mention a great happy hour !
the shrimp was flavourless and just covered in cheap chipotle mayo .
their special combos are only $ 7 and they are very friendly and quick .
it feels like you 're in an entirely different place and it 's so empty when you talk it just echoes really loudly and it 's awkward .
we did n't try any beer but the beer list was impressive .
nothing special . ok for a couple beers .
13 different choices of excellently prepared meats .
my favorite part about brixx though is being able to get a flight of beer and how it seems their beer is always changing up so i can always get something new .
it tasted quite bland , perhaps why i was asked if i wanted curry on my biryani .
the only reason this place did not get 5 stars was due to some minor lacking in the execution area .
the drinks were pretty cheap ( wine , beer , margs ) but i do n't think they had any coors or bud on tap , which is unusual .
the decor is also beautiful .
we sat on the patio , with loud music ( we enjoyed ) we were just there for drinks . the environment was great , very lively with a nice ambiance .
the tacos were tiny and not too bad in flavors . the rice and beans were okay .
the bbq sauce is a vinegary style which i love .
i ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it was no taste at all . really bad , and also the omelette of my husband was really bad , like 90 % egg 10 % the rest , and also no taste .
it is a great place for delicous food at a reasonable price
the shrimp and prawns were so overcooked we did n't even eat them , they were so tough you could n't even cut through them .
meh , they still went well with the chicken .
portions are huge . both times service was good .
got ta love high end food that does n't have an inflated price to match .
perhaps my favorite buffet since 2013. it 's got everything you need and surprisingly , their variety of asian food is quite delicious .
i paid over $ 30 per kid and per adult and it was a total of 5 of us .
i ordered the jicama watermelon salad , butternut squash ravioli , and lemon burst dessert . everything was delicious !
the only turn off is a nasty exterior access bathroom .
came mainly for the lobster rolls , and they were good but nothing to go crazy over .
now some might take this as a sign of fast customer service , but that was it ... totally rushed and overwhelmed .
the decor was very nice , but cluttered with flags and other strange things .
i would highly recommend this place .
i loved the spicy ! great flavor .
a plethora of negative signs : `` bathrooms only for patrons . ''
the setting is quaint and charming in a renovated old house and you must check out the cute signs that mark the bathrooms .
food and drink : their sake is good , and i 'm a huge fan of japanese beer so really enjoyed the kirin draft .
we tried the brownie sundae , which was good ( hard to get that one wrong ) .
there is nothing super special enough here to justify an $ 11 smoothie .
if there were only a few people & the chef did n't take the time to properly clean the ingredients then what is it like when it 's busy ?
the price is obviously $ 1- $ 1.50 more expensive then tims but you get what you pay for !
5 stars for ambiance , 3.5 stars for food . grinder is great if ur looking for a cool vibe and trendy atmosphere - perfect for a fun dinner and drinks .
it was n't even bottled , pretty sure it was tap .
a weak beer selection with the bar running out of the crafts ?
the price is reasonable for what you get although i would want it to be a tad bit cheaper .
the chicken fried rice was actually palatable , it had a smoky taste to it but that brought it a unique flavour that made you want more .
way too expensive for crappy food .
overrated . terrible food at a decently expensive price .
even though it is only $ 13.5 , it is not even worth $ 5 . do n't order it !
unfortunately , the chicken i had was over seasoned and the beef that my friend ordered was so over seasoned that it was inedible . i may have to try again on another day .
and the drink menu was great .
the waitress was really attentive , friendly and chatty .
not muddled properly , and it tasted like gin not rum ... .let 's try the nachos ... .hmmm canned guac , canned jalapeño , and add chicken that is cold and cut up from the night before . at least the spotted beer glasses are cold ... .
i even received a $ 60 parking ticket which made my total purchase $ 90 . that 's still cheaper than a night out with my wife .
we also used a groupon for two at $ 65 , that was a great deal .
they were super moist and the toppings seemed very fresh .
if a pasta dish costs more than $ 10 , it 's not authentic .
they also have a amazing watermelon lemonade .
while telling our server how much i enjoyed it , she mentioned that i could leave my name and contact info and the chef would email me the recipe directly .
any part without fat was hard as rubber .
i also got the homemade iced tea , which was a nice refreshing addition to my meal .
extremely complicated and rude manager ali . security at the door was extremely rude as well and did not provide good customer service .
very good service and friendly staff .
food : 4/10 customer service : 1/10 food is ok , it is n't great and it is n't terrible either . however , the customer service here is terrible .
i also tried a chicken tamale and that was inedible and rubbery .
pretty fantastic happy hour deals for both food and drinks !
there 's a cozy section for dinner with hgtv style decor and then there 's the bar/lounge section .
a nice break from the crazy strip outside
their prices are also pretty fair .
such a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere .
along with other customers i noted asking for requests , they acted like they could n't make theirs either . seemed liked they just did n't want to go out their way .
we always take a big group and i hate paying $ 200 for bad food .
i got a glass of some other kind of beer in a nasty glass .
we were he only two in the place on a rainy sunday afternoon , but we had so much fun !
the food was great , the wine & cocktail selection was also terrific .
the $ 15 entrees were tiny little dishes filled with so much sauce that it could have been mistaken for soup instead of chicken and lamb entrees .
a generous portion of cheese curds but unfortunately they used their bland sauce and the fries were soggy and tasteless .
because it 's cheap .
the atmosphere of the shop can be kind of awkward because of the bad lighting and awkward silences .
it was also very reasonably priced i thought .
blue adobe has become our favorite neighborhood place and we bring all of our out of town visitors there to their delight .
did n't like the fact that they do n't serve soup before the food , or even salad , if you want an horchata to drink they do n't have refills wtf is that ? then if you want an extra hot sauce you get charged for that .
the house margarita was n't bad either .
love the huge waters and drinks .
also , their ranch is amazing and i 'm a huge fan of their fries and veggie sticks ! i that the fries are a little sweet .
zeke e stardust was a nice and light mint refreshing cointreau hibiscus based drink which was probably the best among the three .
i asked for a blended margarita and was told they only do on the rocks . what kind of bar does n't have a blender ?
the tacos were similar . the chicken was really bland and not particularly korean , but the pork and bulgogi were better .
yes , 38 $ c for two glasses of wine is more then average , but the ambience is priceless .
amazing flavor and the food comes out really quick too .
our group had a breakfast burrito , two different kinds of bennys , a traditional eggs and sausage and wonderful banana muffins .
plus , the prices are pretty decent !
the strawberry sesame was just the perfect balance of sesame taste a really great combination .
anyway , i took advantage of the happy hour beer specials , but unfortunately i really hated the second beer ( something by deschutes that i think might have been skunked ) .
for evening drinks we enjoy having the bartender design a drink for us and the deviled egg appetizer is soo good .
i would still come and order but do n't expect to have good customer service !
i love their pear & gorgonzola pizza along with the others , bbq , margarita .
they told me they were going to make this right .
considering it 's all organic food , the prices were reasonable .
nice decor , great patio by the river .
this used to be a fantastic , unique spot to grab a delicious treat , but in the last couple years this place has lost its appeal .
update : i was contacted right away by a manager to apologize for our experience .
i waited a little while longer and called again and finally got ahold of someone .
you think right about noon on a saturday they would be prepared for customers but i added up standing at the front looking like a tool for about 15 minutes and not one person came up to see me or take my order .
pitcher of mojito and an array of tapas under the heater on the patio = perfect date night .
this place is good for a drink or two and a relaxing atmosphere , but probably not an evening out .
we asked what was in the margaritas as in what kind of tequila and the bartender responded `` everything is tequila based like every margarita '' .
i found this very rude .
the cook was absolutely perfect and the meat was delicious .
ordered just about everything , fried chicken was amazing , crispy and succulent , wings were good , pulled pork and brisket was so tasty . sides of coleslaw and macaroni and cheese were delish !
it was good to find a hookah lounge in vegas !
this place i love .
we both got a fruity drink which was deceptively strong !
came here after some friends had visited it themselves a few times and wow !
however the portions per price was high .
i know it 's going for an authentic old-time appeal - but it 's dark , dirty and kinda icky feeling .
pretty good wine selection i guess , i 'm not a wine guy . not much of a beer selection for being a beer and wine bar .
wings are good . prices are on the high end but not reduce loud .
i do n't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible .
if you happen to be seated facing that wall or your table is directly underneath that foul lighting ... .well it 's tremendously unpleasant .
expensive for the food you get .
it could look nicer if the lights were n't so harsh .
atmosphere is very nice . patio is great for people watching too .
most important , very clean and comfortable seating .
we used open table to reserve a table for two and got a nice private one with a view .
i would highly recommend the tokyo girl cocktail , the scallops and the sushi .
i understand the critics who say the food is bland - because most places put so much cloying , thick , syrupy gook on all of the food , one ca n't experience the freshness of the vegetables , and the simplistic cooking style that should go into these dishes .
there was live music which made it difficult to carry on a conversation .
the decor and seating area is lovely but our food was late and extremely dry .
nothing wrong with that but the food was meh .
service was speedy and super polite .
forget the name , but there was one made with whiskey , mint , simple syrup and a fruit ( like blackberries ) that was very good .
pinot grigio : house wine was a good sized pour and crisp , a bit too acidic for me , possibly not opened today ?
it 's bright inside with good amount of seats .
i just ordered the fried saimin and it was really , really bad .
the interior struck me as dated and tired .
pretty reasonable prices and quick service .
my favorite place to go for coffee .
highly recommend if you 're in the area .
great place when it 's cold outside !
mind you , we are a couple who doesnt mind paying a higher price for a good meal .
the almond filling as well as the sliced almonds on top gave this fresh and light pastry my high approval .
food was legit as well . super chill atmosphere , friendly staff , good music .
the bar and drinks looked like a decent selection but did n't drink that night .
pricing is good too .
also we tried to order dos equis on draft but there was something wrong with the tap that made it taste like a completely different beer .
atmosphere the environment was clean , bright and modern .
there was also live music in the bar area and the band playing was fantastic .
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
we decided to go only because there was a groupon that cost 18 $ and you get to spend $ 30 .
all of our starters were great ( far better than the entrees ) . of particular interest were the tiger shrimp & roasted garlic tamales .
no hot dish at all .
i would recommend any one trying once and during happy hour . otherwise you bill for `` just food '' will be quite up there .
fancy but somewhat nauseating decor ( i ca n't explain it , but i had problems looking at the ceiling , it has some weird pattern to it ) .
also the staff is super friendly . i love the hibiscus infused water too .
in my book , indifference is worse than bad service .
presentation was simple and easy . food was delicious .
i 'm not fond of the mismatched furniture and the seats are painfully uncomfortable ( unless you get a booth ) .
the other annoying thing was the bright fluorescent lighting from the kitchen that shines directly in the eyes of half the patrons .
the iced tea was good , and i appreciate that .
i have taken thin crust lovers and even vegetarians here and all agree that it is some of the best pizza they have ever had .
and of course , everything goes better with malibu rum : o )
the bill was outrageous two tiny dinner specials and two cans of warm soda $ 25 .
ambiance did n't feel right for some reason , between weird mood from employees , music not consistent with the restaurant theme and outdated china and silverware .
this restaurant overlooks the pool area of the sheraton grand wild horse pass resort in chandler , arizona .
the ambiance was very nice , not dark where i could n't see the menu but not glaring bright either .
draft beer was not as cold as it should be , order bottles . crappy music .
the food is delicious . reasonably priced .
got ta love the mango . whenever i 'm up in cleveland on business or just for kicks , i try to stop in .
all this food cost us $ 50 . it was soooo good .
the chips that come with the combo was good enough .
it 's a fairly small place , but bright and clean . a nice casual atmosphere .
dim lighting - lighted menus would be nice and i expected them but no dice .
in stock , so i ordered a drink off their cocktail list and it was n't very good .
it cost $ 1.50 for each added item and the sandwich was still a great deal .
delish . friends had some specialty cocktails that they enjoyed .
i 've tried many homemade steamed pork and cabbage dumplings but cooked good ones are hard to come by .
the other dishes were n't memorable except the sweet and sour fish , and not in a good way .
i also had some nice sautéed veggies with garlic and thyme .
new expanded menu and full service wine , beer and liquor makes it a full service restaurant now .
eat here at $ and avoid the crazy expensive meals on the strip .
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
not many beers on tap , but what they had were pretty good .
super great service and our food came quickly !
prices on the menu are pretty reasonable .
they had a cleaning crew there spraying an obnoxious disinfectant , which was quite unpleasant for the people nearby trying to eat .
the waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were .
decent chicken , too expensive . this place is refreshing as an alternative to the other places on campus , but their prices are more expensive than other options around .
it was n't even bottled , pretty sure it was tap .
the prices are reasonable .
they have a huge selection of beers , cocktails , wine , whiskeys , shooters , and signature martinis . a superb selection , and an extensive menu .
one kind of beer .
nice ... service is great and the only reason they lost a star is because i ordered online once and was ignored when i come in to pick it up .
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
in all honesty the place does give off a `` hole in the wall '' feeling , and the really outdated decor does n't help .
place was clean except the men 's washroom ... the ceiling was leaking and water was dripping everywhere .
this is my new favorite coffee shop ! wonderful staff and such a cool atmosphere inside .
our server , joseph , was very attentive .
perfect lunch on the go . i will definitely return as i work in the area .
the decor was cool and the presentation of the food was great .
definitely will never eat here again . overpriced terrible service
not a good place for wine , but about 30 draft beers .
the sushi selection was awesome .
it was good , unpretentious , and reasonably priced .
i like the gondola rides also . rooms are kind of old but it 's roomy and quite .
if you liked this place , you will like bar volo because it has 3 times the selection , so check that out whenever you 're near bloor and yonge . but for those who do n't frequent bloor and yonge area , monk 's kettle will have to do .
i had the tasting menu and particularly enjoyed the foie gras brulee , the scallops , and the pork belly great for a special occasion -- if you are looking to go high end in vegas , definitely do n't miss out on this place
great meal and good prices .
soda only comes via a 20oz bottle and there 's also different iced tea flavors .
she could n't check me into a room and so rudely made rude remarks and acted as if she was incapable of helping me check in .
that in of itself is not a bad thing really , and probably part of the charm , but its painted gray and looks depressing .
for the price you 'd think the food would at least be decent .
despite the overpriced fries , the total damage ( $ 37 for four ) was pretty low .
i ordered chicken parm and it was delicious ! my bf ordered some sausage entree and he loved it .
great sexy little joint on the square .
shout out to this amazing business with great authentic recipes !
annoying . on this same note , the decor inside is really simple ( no problem there ) , but it also borders on uncomfortable .
fast , fresh , and good sized portions .
it 's supposed to be `` high-class '' but it has framed sports pictures , women in bikinis and obnoxiously loud lettering all over the place at random .
they said the kitchen was 15 tickets behind and they ca n't sit tables .
and as for price its can be expensive .
it 's not that they were n't good ... .but seemed like more hangover food and lacked the `` elevated '' style of everything else we ordered .
the pre made eggs looked so bad i did n't dare , the bacon looked microwaved , the pastries were hard , and there were not enough breakfast choices .
their service was terrible , ( filled my own drink ) they forgot half our order , food is mediocre compared to a competing taco restaurant down the street , and they did n't check on us once after they gave us the food . we were very disappointed .
good portions , but , fried dumplings were like shoe leather tough and stale .
however , the price is quite high for what you get .
everyone is extremely nice either way and the food tastes great . i recommend the fried artichokes and the omlettes .
there 's some ugly shit on the walls which made me wonder if i 'd like a hotel room better if the walls were bare .
a great value for the price !
i love the atmosphere . there is a bar , a cozy sun room with a fireplace , and a patio .
prices are more than reasonable as well .
found this location on yelp while looking for a nice lunch .
the inside has an awesome atmosphere perfect for getting out of the house and focusing on some work .
my friend and i split the noce salad and margherita pizza . the salad was delicious with walnuts , gorgonzola , and fresh mozzarella .
the pizza was n't as large as we 'd hoped but it tasted good .
i will say , however , that the service was fantastic , and our servers received a very nice additional tip as a result .
the food is delicious and very reasonably priced .
ray is such a wonderful waitress .
the interior is nostalgic , sure , but really just cluttered and painful to look at .
while the price ( $ 18 per drink ) will keep this from being a regular stop for most people , it makes for a perfect special occasion .
shrimp tempura is 5 star ! spider roll and shrimp shumai are always cooked right .
we love this place ! we eat here often and find this to be an excellent version of a casual restaurant brought to you by the fox family of restaurants .
tasted my dads lamb stew and loved it !
not bad , but they could definitely add some taps or bring in some bottled beer .
the only saving grace was that damon the manager was very apologetic and nice . he 's the only reason i would return .
and i really love their cute little half tables by the wall .
the only reason why she was okay at her job today was cuz her boss was there .
it was okay , it just tasted like a dry chocolate cake with coffee cake crumble on top .
i 've had great experiences and will continue to go !
price wise , it 's pretty expensive . all in all , an average lunch experience .
pricing is good too .
the prices are very reasonably priced .
the servers we encountered today did a great job and we did not want for anything .
prices are decent for those as well .
that 's ok at a mediocre restaurant , but not one that charges prices like this . geesh .
food are pretty decent for the price .
the iced tea was also good .
so happy there is a zipps near me now ! they 've been open for 5 days and are packed .
they really enjoyed their meals .
he was very nice but you think he would of sent someone over to help .
the restaurant has an absurdly tacky interior . a shame , really .
of course they make all the specialty hot drinks as well , my friend enjoyed his latte .
service was good , atmosphere was fun and exciting .
walls are chipped up and needing attention and the lighting is just too bright .
we totally understood and enjoyed the people watching while waiting for our drinks , food , or bill .
the portions are huge !
the worst part was that both my husband and i ended up with stomach cramps and something that could only be described as a mild case of food poisoning almost immediately after finishing our meal .
choice of beers was n't to bad .
it was empty inside and i ordered with just 2 people ahead of me , only to end up waiting 30 minutes for my order , while at least 6 or 7 people came in to pick up their phone ( or maybe online ? ) orders ahead of me .
they still did n't have anything on draft but a good bottle selection .
great interior relaxing place to share a bottle
the food is good though , so if you 're feeling patient and want a good pub burger , dixon 's would be my recommendation !
i came here late at night for a quick grab and go .
went for dinner and when we walked in , all 3 servers look over after the door slams behind us but none stop to welcome us . i went up to the counter , where they glanced over again and continued on .
made for a nice beverage .
the way it works here is you pay for your soup base which ranges from $ 3.00 to $ 5.00 and another $ 0.49 for all you can choose sauces . the rest will be pay as you go !
cold , chewy , overcooked , old ; the food could n't have been worse .
the ugly : it 's worn .
half off appetizers and an awesome bartender .
i went with a group and we ordered plenty of appetizers , including the korean fried chicken .
food was fantastic . wait staff was pretty great , except for 1 gentleman who tried to push an incorrectly made coffee , to just `` drink it anyway '' until told to remake it a few times .
i highly recommend you to try it .
service is decent . price is reasonable .
excellent ! great place and a gem .
we ordered bread and butter ( $ 6 ) but the dinner roll was so doughy and undercooked that it was pretty inedible .
prices are very reasonable and you get a ton of food .
i had the chicken and steak meal which was delicious , my husband had the lamb which was also delicious .
very reasonably priced as well .
there were the normal beer options ( no craft ) and the wine was barefoot so nothing to write home about .
we topped our meal off with a pitcher of margaritas ... which of course were amazing !
dark , dingy and dirty were the words that came to mind .
and if there had been coffee , it was going to cost a ridiculous $ 8 for three pods .
they had a decent draft selection and everyone said the margaritas were pretty good .
other than that , this place is grimy , creepy , and nasty .
when we said we did n't have menus , he got really impatient with us and told us that the menu was on the wall .
sorry guys , awful experience .
the mango sorbet that was brought on accident tasted overtly sweet and was inedible .
they were a good size and priced reasonably .
i 've heard of this place for a while and finally get a chance to visit .
the water is infused with cucumber , which makes it refreshing and just that much more special .
most people seem to be getting take out ( 10 % off ? ) but it was pleasant to sit in and eat .
i see some crazy people with anger management problems .
the food is mostly fried unhealthy vegan cuisine , something i should n't eat anyway .
the beer glasses are n't cold .
the beer selection was pretty poor so i ended up with a whiskey cocktail instead .
it 's hard to come by some good hospitality these days , but i know when i come here i know i 'll get great service and great quality of food !
delish ! i had the salad with spicy pork & it was fabulous !
they also had cheap , tacky posters put up over the beautiful stained glass .
the room was the cleanest and nicest room i 've had in vegas , and the floor to ceiling windows offered a really great view .
i thought it was very reasonably priced at $ 15 .
lots of sauce is nice , but when you 're paying $ 14 for an entree you should get way more meat .
we were seated fairly quickly , and our server jen was awesome ! she was very energetic , funny , and kind , and her recommendations were spot on .
my only complaint was with the vodka drink that i ordered ; the albert 's collins .
it was just surprising that the rest of the place was cleaned up pretty well , but the bathroom ( cool artwork aside ) was kinda gross .
the service was delayed the entire visit . we had to continuously ask to order beverages dessert food and the bill .
it is also a fair price .
i enjoyed sitting by the front window and people watching while i munched .
she then says , oh , i 'm only refunding this meal that had the paper in the drink and if i understand . bs !
it was loud , therefore it is not a good place to have a conversation .
personable and lovely staff . food is amazing !
the staff was friendly and attentive .
i had the sweet tea to drink .
this place deserves zero starts very rude .
the owners were very friendly and very open to questions .
the prices are very reasonable .
what was disappointing was the cold food .
too bad they did n't taste as good as it looked . the macarons were alright ... nothing spectacular though .
the prices are reasonable and the wine selection is really good .
attractive , i know .
besides being out of the way on the strip , the interior and decor are completely outdated and worn .
side of house rice - boring .
i got my beer and i ordered dos equis but they brought another kind , but beer was beer and need beer in me .
it looked like there was no seating when we went through the line but by the time we were done they were empty seats . they had ice cold courtesy water at the end of the checkout
but after seeing my reaction she took it upon herself to see if it was ready ... now that 's a good waitress !
recommend grabbing a bite and walking out into one of the side areas of the market where there are benches and you can make yourself comfortable , enjoy your snack , and then continue enjoying the market .
it was nice that they had draft beer .
i 've only been here for lunch , but it 's a solid place to get good portions for cheap , and quick ! i think dinner prices are a bit high , but there 's a m-f lunch special where you get a full sized meal for $ 9-10 ( plus free chips and salsa ) .
my drink of choice is iced mocha and it was delicious .
i was pretty hungry but even i could n't finish all the fries .
it is quite expensive for what you get .
prices are higher than most , but not justified in my opinion .
then she was still talking and filled the drinks only 3/4 the way full manager came out the back and instead of fixing the problem , started gossiping with them .
the place is attractive , but neither upscale nor particularly intimate though we required a flashlight to read the menus .
my only concern though is the lighting .
the perfect place for the family to dine after a day out at the soccer or baseball fields , so take a break from the pizza joints and visit a restaurant that is truly unique .
very cool building , the blue windows are very cool , looks like a spaceship .
smells great , but the taste was bland .
the pate had so little taste to it it 's no wonder they had little dollops of spicy mustard to go with it . the chicken was tough and whatever the melange of things that came with it was just did n't help or work at all .
the lighting seemed quite dark to me , not sure if that is appropriate for a bbq joint .
it 's a cute shop with a nice outdoor section to enjoy your donuts , too . the music is a bit loud inside .
wegz stadium is the ultimate men 's paradise ! loaded with tv 's all around the restaurant , above the bar , even your own tv when you sit in a booth !
( too bad i got take out ) the lighting is quite dim .
simple menu with a good amount of selection yet is n't overwhelming .
well drinks are pretty weak , so i stick to beers .
reasonably priced as well .
the beef in the soup was dry ... like what the what what now ?
it is a hike if you 're coming off the interstate ( about 2 miles ) , but the location was new , fast , friendly , and damn near perfect .
the atmosphere was good but cramped where sat .
everything was edible but extremely salty .
it 's right in front of the panorama towers !
the location is great with the outdoor area right by the fountain in the forum shops .
they only had a few beers on tap , and none that were particularly exciting .
for was good . great prices and high portions .
the beer selection was n't bad .
let 's not even discuss the thin walls or `` blackout '' curtains .
it 's a beautiful area over by the wigwam .
i like to sit outside in the summer but inside has a cozy feel that is nice too .
the bathroom is in serious need of an update and lighting .
more lighting would certainly help .
i had the cabernet sauvignon for $ 12 a glass and it was a nice complement to the food . the service was really friendly here too and they gave us good wine recommendations .
always delicious , have to stop every time i 'm in phoenix . there is always a pretty good wait , but it 's worth it .
i got a beer sampler and a couple of the beers were ok , but nothing really impressive .
downtown 140 is my favorite restaurant in ohio for a reason .
thank you to the staff for a great start to the evening .
finally i got someone who picked up and was nice enough to say they were really slammed . i told him i would be ok with picking up and he was happy and said that would be great .
lunch portions were decent , so the value of your dollar is good here .
the food was fresh and delicious .
mostly because the pizza is amazing .
this is a lovely little restaurant .
nice to have craft beer on tap and bottle . should n't be in a chilled glass though .
cost ? i opted to just go for dinner and though the price was fair .
mood was happy and it kept me happy .
and let me reiterate that the staff are terrific , fun n friendly .
the presentations of their food is always very pretty , and they offer a variety of spreads for your toast that comes with your meal .
only thing good about it was the ice cream .
it 's pretty cool .
when i asked if cheese came with it she just said `` i can put it on there '' in a tone that again seemed like she was annoyed by me .
we do n't mind paying a lot for a good meal but this experience made me feel that i had been taken .
you can easily make dumplings at home that taste better and cost you a fraction of what they charge .
my favorite drink is the scorpion .
now , the ambiance and the tv 's in the booth are incredible arbitrary elements .
over all disappointed for $ 9 that i paid .
i have been waiting 24 minutes as i write this and still no drink , poor server is running frantic trying to keep up serving over 60 people by herself .
so romantic looking over the city : )
the interior looks not too bad .
the sweet and attentive waiter brought a glass of a different wine , but it was n't much better .
i highly recommend this restaurant !
the menu is set at premium prices for the midwest location , not off the charts , just up in the high range .
extremely reasonably priced for lunch .
the chairs are kind of weird ... all metal , but that 's to go with the theme i suppose .
great taste , humble service and pretty great prices for the portions ! $ 12 for a burger and it 's worth it
was visiting a friend and saw this greek place and wow what a great find in lv !
i highly recommend this place !
the best part is they were only $ 4 a piece .
the sage advice mixed drink was outstanding as well .
i called to ask which tacos were included but they did n't bother to mention the time . was pretty perturbed to show up at 1:30 to find we had to pay full price .
horrible , awful customer service . hostess was rude and incompetent .
well to be honest , she did ask about a refill as she brought the check , too late now .
the thing that surprised me most about this spot is how reasonable the prices are .
took my boyfriend here for an anniversary dinner and had a great experience .
so lucky to live nearby ! every sunday would take a stroll before i start my errands for their americano !
now the margaritas ( and i ordered the house version ) are definitely five stars - kudos to the bartender . service was definitely good .
they have a nice wine selection list .
it 's not fancy , it is however incredibly good and very cheap too .
it 's $ 5 , so it 's pretty cheap .
our first time , party of 4 , since it 's byob we brought our favorite beverages : i bottle wine , tiny bottle prosecco ( twist off lid we opened ourself ) and a bottle beer .
my friend and i made an hour-long commute , only to find that the vegan shakes ( at a whopping 15 $ ) were just cold coconut milk with oreos and freezer burnt marshmallows , we then stupidly decided to order their $ 10 piece of trash milkshake .
and the price is good .
order a miller lite and was given a draft beer even though i said i hated draft .
was nice to be able to sit out on the patio for dinner .
keep up the great work .
the moonshine drink was delicious and strong .
for the life of me , i do n't remember my drinks ( yes i got nicely buzzed as i started drinking after work here ) but i remember having a great variation of a spicy spicy ceaser , and a great drink with grapefruit juice in it .
great drinks too . mmmmmmm .
however there was a mysterious winter price which was about $ 8 more than the normal summer price ?
the total bill for just the food was $ 100 the drinks were $ 10.50 for long islands but i hear the price might vary by bartender .
as well as super patient while i decide , with each glass , more painfully , what to have next . great selection of wines , although i do wish the wines by the glass changed more often .
the service was good , everyone was nice and polite .
it did n't feel `` clean '' as another reviewer said and the bright lights just showcase every imperfection of the place .
i think they could halve the portion size , knock 25 % off the price , and have happy customers & more profits .
the crispy skin chicken and duck were also roasted to perfection .
love their special white pizza . always have had a great experience , can get a bit loud as the dining room echoes .
the korean meats were not marinated enough and the hamburger patty was a bit dry and needed a little more salt and pepper .
it was still cold !
it just gets way too hot during the summer and makes the whole experience not comfortable .
i had a vodka tonic , and sex on the beach , and both were a-ok. as others have mentioned , the pitchers are cheap . the servers are n't keen on , well , serving .
instead , for $ 50 , i got a bland well cooked steak that i could have done without .
their food is massive ... the price is n't cheap ... but it 's really good .
absolutely ridiculous for the $ 12 price tag .
food is horrible and way overpriced . payed 36 per person for dinner and food is not even appetizing .
when you are spending $ 65 for a steak , you should expect a decent drink .
only downside , they switched our beers at table , but all beer is good beer anyway .
the décor is pretty sick , kind of like a `` day of the dead '' theme .
add guac and the total is still under 10 bucks .
the inside was very small , private and cutely decorated !
she dismissed us by saying `` i work very hard for my money '' .
the floor is n't the greatest , bathrooms ... let 's ignore those .
horrible service , totally non-attentive , dirty , unorganized .
very modern and cool atmosphere .
yeah , this place is cheap . cheap food , cheap prices , and cheap service -- these are three things that you are going to find at this restaurant .
wine list is very small btw . they offer @ 4 `` inexpensive '' ( $ 70 ) bottles and the rest are over $ 100 .
the ceiling tiles are in bad shape , with lots broken and stained . the whole ceiling looks bad .
the space was great and there 's plenty of street parking nearby !
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
the prices are very reasonable .
probably my favorite place to go !
but good thing we waited because after 20 mins , we ended up getting the window seats which we totally did n't mind .
the sushi chef even came to our table to talk to us : ) prices : $ 1.00 , $ 1.50 , $ 2.00 , $ 3.00 and $ 5 plates .
as for the drinks : -after all , the bar was just calling out to me and although i had hoped to see more beers on tap , unfortunately , a majority of their beer list was bottled .
the interior belies the very shabby strip-mall exterior and makes for a classy ambiance . service friendly and quick .
i noticed there eel sauce was different .
their sangria is my favorite , as well as every margarita i 've tried and the other drinks like the pina colada and lava flow .
lots of tomatoes and mushroom , on the sweet side , definitely not traditional tom yum broth .
food : ( 5/5 ) had a juicy steak , and draft beer + lychee mojito for drinks . everything tasted great !
expensive menu less value and you walk away kind of hungry .
definitely a great date night spot .
the decor is very dated and the cleanliness leaves something to be desired . our room was relatively clean if you disregard the weird stains on the curtains .
and they have some good beers for the pitcher not .
the atmosphere is fair- it is small and well lite . the prices are very reasonable and the wine list is good .
although i do n't drink beer , i was impressed by their incredible selection of beer on tap .
a friend from work recommended this place for a business dinner . what an unexpected find .
place is clean . food is decently priced .
i was told they have a good selection of beers on tap .
i did a prepaid deal ( no refund if i canceled ) , which gave me a great rate on the room .
and with that said , the food is reasonably priced .
fair and affordable pricing .
really enjoyed the entertainment .
besides being out of the way on the strip , the interior and decor are completely outdated and worn .
prices are decent too .
yes a unique drink experience !
employees always nice and service fast .
also , while the restaurant has a trendy vibe , i do n't feel like any of it was necessary .
unfortunately the food is pretty bland and the cleanliness is questionable ( food stains on the walls and room divider blinds and support columns ) .
great experience for having some cocktails and sharing some food .
awesome service . fantastic bottle of wine .
never had a bad experience here .
the sad part about the the whole experience it cost me $ 50.00 .
i enjoyed a glass of malbec and tempranillo -- fabulous !
beer selection was good , but a gastropub should have unique vessels for drinks . cider in a guinness pint glass is just ... .wrong .
they enjoyed their fish and chips .
only thing was i know the lighting is for ambiance and what not but its hard to read the menu with the lights so dim .
it 's taken longer than `` normal '' fast food .
so 16 wings for more than $ 32 after tax and they have the nerve to even charge extra again for asking for lots of sauce used to be my favorite place , but the menu prices make me sick now
the summer special is a great deal . pizza is very good and kids meals are reasonably priced .
the 5 $ pizzas are the only things out there that is worth the money .
it 's tasty . it 's decently priced .
it had no sauce to speak of , no peanutty goodness , just spicy , dry noodles .
we ordered 1 hookah for 3 of us and bought the flavor blue mist ( blueberry mint ) . the flavor was very refreshing and the hookah hit well .
they melt in your mouth and the sauce is amazing .
when i asked for a lot his reply was `` i believe i asked you if you needed anything else . and was annoyed that he had to give me what i asked for .
i do n't enjoy the flavor of alcohol so this spiked slushy was the perfect drink for me .
prices are good for the food and ambiance .
only bummer is that i did n't see any draft beer , only bottles .
i took my wife there and we were greeted by a very friendly hostess .
i 've paid $ 225 and $ 160 per person for omakase at these places and fairly enjoyed the experience .
the salad that comes with the meal is incredible and so are all of the sides !
the food is good and the servers have always been great to us .
not many people there at lunch time just two tables i should of known that it was n't that good . however they were nice people .
singapore noodles are not authentic either , but still tastes really good .
i can just come over here sushi and the soups alone , they are fresh and delicious .
for drink prices , do you know the difference between ridiculous and really ridiculous ?
the margarita was weak but ok and there is no way to screw up a cold corona !
the mashed potatoes tasted like dirt , so glad i was n't the one that ordered it .
unfortunately , they lack beer on tap but the do have a variety of bottles .
the pho here is pretty good for a pretty cheap price .
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
the breading was so thick i figured there had to be some chicken in there somewhere .
you wo n't be disappointed .
sad bc this is a cool sports bar but i have other choices . update .
awesome outdoor area with a bar and regular tables .
their donair has a great flavour and still is a little moist .
it just really nice to be acknowledged when you tip .
only negative , not many beers on tap , we ordered three times before we got a beer listed that they actually had on tap : (
but unfortunately everything lacked flavor . i had the turkey wrap which was basic , matcha float with boba that was good minus the boba cause it was bland .
definitely return visits are coming , especially for the sangria .
there were only about 10 customers in the whole restaurant other than the bar for happy hour .
the price is reasonable .
no complaints on not having a full glass of beer .
the prices are a bit high , however the product is top quality so that is justified .
super laid-back place to eat great patio area for those that live here in arizona .
it 's only $ 5 too .
i have never heard of this place before stopping in on a weekend and i absolutely loved it !
beer wise , stick to bottles .
i did n't care much for them and the other two dishes were extremely salty with lots of msg .
eddie made us feel very welcome .
my turkey was dry and the gravy was cold . my father 's beef was dry and tough .
the `` og '' margarita was n't bad in flavor , but did n't have any indication that any tequila was in it .
we only do wine and beer at the bar . ''
pay a totally reasonable price for your meal .
i had no idea you could charge over $ 13 for the most flavorless weak margarita in vegas .
spice level 9 out of 10. very good soup and scallops 10/10 !
instead , i could basically only detect a chili or spicy taste .
mediocre at best . plate dinners average $ 10 .
i started with an excellent peach bellini and followed that up with my favorite drink of the trip .
i ca n't wait to come again and bring others to share this amazing experience with !
nachos and no beer does not make me happy .
this is my favorite place to go for lunch .
one bad thing and just being picky was the mushrooms did n't taste fresh , kinda slimy , can style .
the eel was slimy , and had a squishy consistency and the rice was cold .
nobody cared for the wings , i think it was more of the quality of them then the flavor . i liked the flavor .
the decor of the fake palm tree and wooden tiki statue was a little tacky , but again , did not deter me from ordering : - ) .
they put them down in front of the wrong people .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
the squid was the only ingredient seasoned , and the rest of the salad a bit bland .
our room was dirty , mostly the bathroom . the counter was dirty , there was hair in the tub and pee on the toilet !
went one night for drinks and had an amazing gin and elderflower liquor mix !
the food is so tasty and authentic .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
the service is simply amazing . the whole experience definitely worth the two month wait , and the $ $ $ ; )
drinks could be better and prices are slightly high but as there is no sitting fee , it is very good .
the service is attentive , warm and friendly . the atmosphere and decor is beautifully designed .
my meal was great - no complaints . veggies were crisp and meat was juicy .
the decorations throughout the restaurant are so unique and really give a cool vibe to the place .
really nice people and a fun crowd .
any time a server delivers your margarita with , `` i 'm a terrible bartender because i like drinking too much .
what bothered me was the lighting - it 's very bright , fluorescent and distracting . music was a bit loud and bothersome .
great service , beautiful location .
get the mango yinzerita -- it was delicious and i was rocked .
great pizza ! i 've never had their numerous other italian dishes , but it all looks amazing !
the bar and drinks looked like a decent selection but did n't drink that night .
we were n't disappointed again ... ramiro 's is great ... generous portions , great prices , huge selection ... you can even get most everything ala carte .
its only a dollar .
the person at the desk told us ( in a rude manner ) there 's a difference between the fee being waived and comped .
the food was good , especially the lumpiang and the eggplant salad , but the grilled squid was underwhelming because it lacked seasoning ( which i have n't experienced before at a filipino restaurant ) .
the employees here ( especially the owner ) are extremely kind and always seem very welcoming to each customer who stops by .
if you like doing makeup , the lighting in the bathroom and entire room sucked .
very good meal for a reasonable price
prices are relatively cheap , 4.99 for sandwich and 7.99 for plates .
the portions are very decent and the prices too .
the beer was decent and drinkable .
the drinks were strong and the staff is excellent .
the chicken was so over cooked i did n't even finish it .
i only like the fries and that was it .
nice happy hour selection for both drinks and food .
no tap beer , no blended drinks for a decent margaritas and out of steak for tacos .
there 's a view that is absolutely amazing , down the strip .
the margaritas and drinks are all very bland and watered down despite what they advertise as `` 1800 '' tequila .
we had a couple of cocktails , i had the moscow mule , i asked them to add mint to mine and they did it perfectly .
great , quick food and they have pretty good deals like two tacos and a 12 ounce pbr for $ 3.99 .
i have heard about chef marc 's for years but only just got to visit recently for my mom 's birthday .
nothing to write home about , specially not for $ 13 !
needless to say at the end of this experience we ripped up the delivery menu .
i do n't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine .
however , the restaurant itself is large and is not intimate or romantic .
their wine list was fabulous and very extensive .
cozy inside and nice outdoor bar too .
it was really good . however , i did n't like the balsamic vinaigrette , so i got it dry .
it is not unusually pricey for downtown scottsdale with $ 13- $ 15 salads .
love how much more space this one has .
decently priced , would definitely recommend .
so overall the food was amazing - we had shrimp and biscuit for appetizer with a delicious romaine salad , then filet mignon . the bread was to die for , the ambiance , and service were excellent ... why not 5 ?
the food was all very fresh and tasty .
the decor is tired and worn but who cares ?
the fries i received on my plate were terrible .
the prices are very reasonable . most dishes are ~ $ 6.99 .
the decor is hipsterish in an unkempt way and bathrooms were atrocious ... .
the sushi rice was cold ( supposed to be room temperature ) and was also unseasoned , eel was also cold and not toasted .
only reason why it is missing a star is because of the interior was pretty dark and old .
the shrimp are great , a lil sweet flavor but none the less it 's good boiled shrimp . i do not like the crawfish , very tiny & flavor is n't quite there .
we started making reservations and it 's wonderful .
everything is covered in tasteless , orange grease . the chicken itself was terrible too and they serve cheap converted rice .
good drinks , too !
kind of weird , and not really fitting .
beer choices were weak , wine choices were fine .
fair prices and good food .
nice atmosphere , tons of tv 's to catch the games and the food - really , really good .
the food was decent although i imagine it 's difficult to completely screw up a cheese pizza and a house salad .
the raw horseradish is far better than the cream sauce .
the rice i got was soooo dry and the chicken i had was very bland .
the sandwiches are delicious and filling !
reminds me of ny pizza but kind of overpriced . $ 4 for a cup of soda pop and $ 5 for a slice of pizza ... kind of expensive for a carry out type of food joint .
music is loud , and combined with the people , it forms a incoherent droning sound that can make it difficult to understand what 's being said .
our server laura was so sweet and friendly and was so patient with our orders and requests !
food is good though ... everything is $ 5.95 and decent for a casual meal with friends .
so happy they opened a place in sw right next to my house .
it 's cheap and filling .
drinks were once again awesome , and the whiskey selection is very respectable .
for lunch it 's only $ 20.95 per person ! such a great deal , compared to going to bacchanal for $ 50 a person ( ugh ) .
it looks good but makes some of the sashimi watery .
the bathroom was nice , but the advertisements in the mirror were tacky .
prices were reasonable everything seemed to stay under 15 dollars .
the fremont has a great seafood buffet for under $ 20 a person .
not to mention 45 minute wait and high delivery charge .
it 's very distracting and weird .
he was over the moon for his gyro and the bite i tried was very flavorful . my chicken sandwich was solid , but the fries were amazing !
such as pillows , fabric , and the lighting hung in weird places .
the decor is a bit gaudy , but i 'm fairly certain that 's by design .
no draft beer , but a decent choice of cans and bottles .
because now i have a favorite pizza place close to my home .
our first visit here a couple months ago was nice .
especially when you are there at the restaurant to escape the craziness that comes in out of the casino .
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
the menu is impressive and very tempting with the unique toppings .
drink special for an hour was nice .
the portions are massive for only paying half price !
i do n't know how they fair on weekends but they do n't have a huge amount of seating indoors but do have a patio area with fire pits and that section is pet friendly .
$ 19.99 a person without alcohol is kinda pricey for a mediocre buffet .
the music was fantastic - electronica with just enough funk to keep your foot tapping .
the weird thing was that we walked in and stood for a min because we were n't sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves or not .
the portion is huge .
rasta pasta was great and the portion was huge !
i thoroughly enjoyed the chicken & waffles . there was a good balance of sweetness and salty .
pro tip : they make a homemade jalapeno hot sauce that is n't too spicy .
it sad that our $ 80 dinner was worth a $ 10 meal .
the price of each food ( about $ 15 ) is a bit much , but the portion is pretty good and the location is obviously at wynn hotel .
also , a random unnecessary thing to note : the girls washroom has a very fancy sink , the guys do not .
at first glance , the menu is boring and you wonder why your relatives or friend made you drive 35 minutes for the usual .
a great deal considering a burger alone is about $ 10 anyway .
the coffee is very good and the cafe 's new backyard patio is a great addition .
the decoration and interior really suck unfortunately .
a divey mexican place that only serves chicken . it was ridiculously cheap and actually quite tasty .
reasonably priced as well .
the fruit was sour and shriveled , the coffee was cold and bitter , the hash browns were undercooked and lacked seasoning and crispness .
we asked what was in the margaritas as in what kind of tequila and the bartender responded `` everything is tequila based like every margarita '' .
when i arrived to pick up our food at 6pm , there was only one table occupied in the restaurant .
the place is cute and nicely decorated .
wine recommended with 2 different tastings was a great experience .
the drinks are pretty reasonably priced .
food is decent and drinks prices are ok as well .
i thought the tap list was great even though i did n't have a beer .
and $ 16 for a starter is a little ridiculous .
the staff was very sweet and we never felt rushed or had to ask for anything twice .
the beer list was disappointing .
not that i drink beer but they have huge beer selection , over a 130 beers on tap .
it was nice to enjoy lunch on the patio and people watch while enjoying lunch with friends .
mac & cheese was gritty ... can not even explain that one .
he was funny and made sure we had a great time .
the decor is very dated and the cleanliness leaves something to be desired . our room was relatively clean if you disregard the weird stains on the curtains .
i 'm annoyed by paying $ 2.50 for a can of coke that obviously is not refillable .
prices are more than reasonable ( lunch specials are great ) and portions are awesome .
about 20 minutes for the food but we were told beforehand which was nice .
my lettuce l guess was meant only for decoration since it was dry n old .
i also find it to be reasonably priced !
she said the sauce was good but the noodles were stuck together which ruined the experience .
maybe with my own wine glass !
loved the vibe here ! i love how you can eat and go play in the yard .
i was so annoyed as i listened to this crew continue to chit chat in front of customers with lack of care for the quality of food , appearance , and customer experience . management should read the reviews and share them with the employees and work to improve your food quality and experience !
i wish i would have order a martini glass full of that too !
unfortunately , the price per item is actually per item as in 1 croquette = $ 8 and that 's absurd . i respect food , but it seems that these things are overpriced just because people are willing to pay for them and not because the quality is any better .
in fact , there is a great menu with both happy hour and reverse happy hour deals for drinks and food .
the cocktails were good too i had the scarlet and the pimms cup both were very good but the pimms cup was my favourite , it was refreshing and tasty !
2.5 stars it 's one of those hole in the walls where you feel really bad about yourself after .
palazzo has extravagant rooms and amazing customer service . i stay here everything i go to vegas and always have a great time .
decent margarita , but in the wrong glass .
i would recommend to enjoy your drinks and food on the balcony because it is nice view . service is little slow .
good thing my plate only cost 10 bucks .
pretty cool spot to hang out when you 're in old vegas , fremont st. it has an adult play ground ... slides and a tree house . also cool trendy stores and bars to check out .
good selection of beer , wine ... not at all .
it 's a cool restaurant with a rustic industrial flair to it .
unfortunately , the middle of the slices were very soggy and heavy and it was impossible to take the pizza out of the pan .
the staff was friendly and made some good food .
the prices are reasonable and the quality is excellent .
it 's a great atmosphere , with great outdoor and indoor seating . menu options are perfect .
the beer menu was pretty weak . they did n't have much on tap and the bottle selection was just as poor .
a little uninspired but tasty for what you are paying for .
the asparagus tasted like a dirty grill and were n't cooked well .
the drinks are a little expensive but that 's the price you pay for convenience at any restaurant .
on the table : king & i fried rice , a blend of seafood , poultry , meat , and the good ol ' thai spices that make the fried rice aromatic and flavorful .
i asked the bartender what kind of tequila it was , they had no clue !
super tacky in my opinion .
the prices are very reasonable , especially the lunch menu .
only shining star was the decor .
only negative , not many beers on tap , we ordered three times before we got a beer listed that they actually had on tap : (
they obviously have high rent so the food is high priced .
i was imagining a more romantic type of vibe but the bright pink paint was n't my thing .
perfectly cooked however , we did notice when we got home we were over charged so be sure to check your receipt before leaving .
i 'm delighted that i can now get a glass of wine with my meal as well .
prices are very reasonable .
if shady business practices do n't discourage you , the food is actually good . i wo n't be returning
the lighting was totally off - it was way too bright .
i ran into someone in ventura calif , who was from montreal and marathon came up as a favorite casual restaurant on the west island for both of us .
not sure about the decor .
the night started weak , but ended strong .
the food was great and we did n't have to wait for our table .
the decor is pretty basic and they let people write on the walls .
the food was excellent , hot and tasty and made perfectly .
i wanted to free the smelly bull from the shame of working such an awful place .
the whole set up is kind of awkward .
everything that i had was great but the prices are high ( $ 8-9 for a lunch plus the drink ) .
i 'm not an expert on interior design or anything like that , but it just did n't feel comfortable in there .
i suggest the sweet t ( peach whiskey and black tea ) .
the prices are very affordable especially if you are on a budget .
i 'm always a happy customer here . their servers are so friendly .
both were great but especially loved the artichoke hearts .
after we were able to get someone 's attention the food came fast .
everything is decently priced .
corleone 's have great philly cheese steaks but they will run you about $ 6.50 and if you add fries and a drink that will run you another $ 2.50 and it with tax you are talking about $ 10 for one person to have lunch .
the drinks were very good from the martini menu . however , the food was the major let down .
my food was okay but nothing special .
she offered to replace the undercooked chicken but at that point we were finished and ready to leave . she took it off the ticket .
the two stars are for the delicious cocktails i had at the bar .
i gave this one a three stars mostly because we ordered a pitcher or margarita and honestly i did not taste any tequila .
the lunch buffet is a fantastic deal .
this was definitely my kind of cocktail list .
plus , their 1/2 off any bottle of rose on sunday is a real treat !
the drink selection looked so wonderful and refreshing but i am not consuming alcohol for awhile , so i decided to get cozy with a hot tea .
the bottled beer was n't as cold as we like it .
we came here for dessert and drinks only , they have a very nice patio with a beautiful view .
the food came pretty fast too . prices are reasonable .
very relaxed atmosphere makes this a great date night spot .
to be honest the decor is bizarre .
you can choose from sweet or traditional sauce and plenty of toppings ! wheat crust is also an option !
i think it was because the broth was so weird tasting .
two of us tried two gin cocktails - both were super tasty .
all in all , great experience and amazingly friendly staff .
and the prices are pretty high .
waiting to get in is expected but waiting another 20 minutes to get beverages is terrible .
great food for a decent price .
always find a good bargain .
if you happen to be seated facing that wall or your table is directly underneath that foul lighting ... .well it 's tremendously unpleasant .
stupid idiots left a flyer on my door , but after ordering called back 10 minutes later and said it was to far to drive . wtf
free margarita with yelp check in was awesome , and strong enough .
for me this uncalled for and make dinners uncomfortable .
oh , and the prices are very reasonable for what you 're getting .
the drink list as usual was on point and the wine list is incredible .
the decor is confused .
for nearly $ 40 for just the pork chop i expected much better , and $ 30 for the chicken is pretty pricey as well .
also it is pretty expensive but worth the money .
the margaritas and drinks are all very bland and watered down despite what they advertise as `` 1800 '' tequila .
drinks were fine and they had a good selection of beers on tap .
shout out to lisa for making it an incredible experience for us .
the caipirinha is a pretty strong drink made with lime juice , sugar , and an alcohol made from sugar cane juice ( tastes kind of like light rum ) .
could n't even scrape it off my meal since i hate sesame seeds . i hate vegas food lol everything sucks
it was mediocre at best .
i do n't know for some reason that day the wait on food was horrible we waited for almost an hour for our food to come out .
the lighting inside is very dim , to the point of almost using my cell phone light to read the menu .
i would have given it a five star except that it is a bit unclean around the edges ( floors , fixtures , lights , booths ) that could be improved easily .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
it was only after all that we found out why he even came running out .
i was not happy this trip for the small pour drinks that i had .
it was salty and super oily .
quite expensive so be prepared if you 're not looking to drop $ 100+ for a party of two !
great mood lighting and a comfortable atmosphere .
that in of itself is not a bad thing really , and probably part of the charm , but its painted gray and looks depressing .
the lighting was a little bright but maybe that 's just me .
the ambiance is very relaxed yet sophisticated .
my only negative feedback is that the amaebi is overpriced at $ 7.50 per shrimp .
the interior was a different story .
the broccoli salad is amazing !
a good place to go if you only want a snack or want to spend less than $ 10.00 on dinner .
the menu is large and priced good .
the chicken itself was dry as a bone and burnt as well .
the decor is pleasant but the darkness in the restaurant ( 7:30pm ) , reading the menu requires night vision goggles and makes the decor nearly invisible to appreciate .
food high quality , but not particularly imaginative . atmosphere mediocre unless you have a patio seat , which offers a great view of the bellagio fountain .
mediocre meal i would n't pay 19 bucks for again .
it 's cute , that 's about it . the mismatch chairs with random decorations kind of puts me off .
price is very very good .
very lush and lots of cool birds .
it might be fine as an all you can eat place since inflated sticker prices and smaller portions always make you feel like you are getting a better deal when you eat 4 `` $ 15 '' `` rolls '' but it makes for a pretty terrible a la carte experience .
lunch is about $ 40 dinner is about $ 55 ( per person ; including tax ) seems like there 's a lot of variety but it 's not as flavorful or satisfying .
if you read in between the lines , slow service , rude , poor food quality ... .
the atmosphere was wonderful too -- a rustic basement room with wooden floors and stone walls . staff was pleasant and accommodating .
prices are very reasonable .
it is a little pricey , $ $ for sure .
decor : it 's so colourful ( not in a tacky `` ugly betty '' way ) i love it !
the springs rolls were good but a little bland .
terribly cold outside , but warm and welcoming inside !
but they are good . prices are a bit high for it to be a cheap grab a quick bite type of place
the servers were extremely polite and friendly .
first things first , service here is fast which is very appreciative especially at an airport .
while we did not drink any booze , they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers , wine , and specialty cocktails .
i 'm giving it a 4 star because i felt like the decor was a little cheesey ... the food is amazing ... it deserves matching surroundings .
then we ordered a bottle of wine that was very reasonably priced and to our liking for $ 24 - a nice argentinian malbec .
what bothers me is the lack of care to get me the right order . one time they gave me someone else 's entirely different order .
the food is kind of pricey , $ 9 for a pizza pocket and $ 17 for two cans of pbr .
secondly , the burgers are pretty expensive , i think we paid about $ 9 each for an average meal here .
the ambiance is nice , comfortable seating , booths , tables , a long bar .
we had a bottle of an effervescent sweet sake with our meal .
when we asked her to explain how it happened she starts yelling at us to the point it was so loud that three tables can hear her .
quiet due to the cold weather .
the draft beer selection was lacking but the bottle service was awesome .
i do n't think i would have been so harsh on the food , if the customer service had not been so awful .
their noodles and ingredients are also super fresh !
there was the usual huge array of buffet desserts .
by the way , the package total value was $ 30 .
i was disappointed with the veggie salad , however , as it was mostly just lettuce .
for a place called hash kitchen , the hash was underwhelming - it was dry and lacked flavor .
staff if always very pleasant .
the burgers are incredibly tasty and unique in the contents .
unfortunately , i am not a craft beer drinker , but they did had a very large beer selection .
we just stopped in for the drinks after a long day riding the light rail , walking around downtown , climbing a mountain , and renting peddle boats on tempe town lake . these drinks were a treat for the day we had out in the sun .
the music was n't too loud so i was fine with it .
it looks nice , but the set up was quite awkward .
food is very good and priced fairly .
i only gave this four stars because yelp + business owners remove all low ratings and i felt my experience should be published .
did n't drink , but good draft selection . reccomended .
there is a share charge , but most people would not be able to eat a whole one by themselves .
somewhat full bar not just beer and wine they do have liquor as well .
their `` vegetable noodles '' are quite greasy and only had some cabbage and tomato chunks in it . no other vegetables .
the only knock is that there was no beer on tap ; bottle selection was good though .
too expensive for too little mediocre food .
it 's probably 1 step below the highest end steak houses but for the price you get incredible value .
i did no drink one , but apparently the margaritas were pretty good and not a bad deal by the pitcher .
my sandwich did not have the chicken i ordered on it and my husbands steak was not cooked correctly .
the limoncello was refreshing and just perfect .
the fry on it was fine but the fish itself was a bit tough .
after we were both done with our drinks she finally came to the table and asked how the meal was and if we needed anything . i told her just the check .
i got the drunken noodles and it was incredibly greasy ... it also tasted a bit bland ... also was n't the most authentic .
very very overpriced for one taco , the carne was tasteless . got the shrimp bowl , shrimp was okay .
not muddled properly , and it tasted like gin not rum ... .let 's try the nachos ... .hmmm canned guac , canned jalapeño , and add chicken that is cold and cut up from the night before . at least the spotted beer glasses are cold ... .
also ordered the seafood pasta , a first at this establishment , and it was lackluster : bland and poorly plated .
while we did not drink any booze , they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers , wine , and specialty cocktails .
my message to the owner is get your act together - do n't be arrogant , hire the right folks and coach them to success and to provide a positive dinning experience . also do n't run to albertson 's every day to buy food - poor management from a cost base , customer perception and drives costs up for all !
but all i experienced was bad customer service .
it was rather bland and definitely not as good as the past visits .
the prices are ok. they 're generally anywhere from $ 11- $ 15 for a really nice meal .
great drinks too with the lemoncello .
fair prices and a great atmosphere.. get there early if you want a seat inside and feel free to read the notes that people have written to each other on napkins inside the small table in the corner of the front room .
the bathroom hallway seemed a but spooky , but not too bad .
it 's 34.99 for weekend dinner which feels like a premium , but actually most ayce places are all pretty much over $ 30 now unless you 're looking at a questionable place ...
for $ 27.95 a person i had high expectations going in .
wine list is great too .
i did not ask for any special tequila .
i sooooo miss the mega sized meatball ... the 2 smaller ones were still good ... but i soooo enjoyed slicing and dicing and portioning .
that 's a little sad considering they charge $ 35 for regular buffet and $ 50 for seafood . get it together , rio .
delicious too . the chirashi was tasty and fresh .
in the 3 times that i have been there the manager has been rude and will let you just stand there at the register without even acknowledging that you are there .
amazing ! dessert on the menu was tiramisu ( classic , and well done ! )
the wine selection is excellent , at least i was happy with that .
the food was delicious , and the menu has gluten free options too .
food was n't hot . chicken cold- tasted old .
maybe it 's because they paid full price ?
very good food from appetizer to dessert .
do n't know but that annoyed me .
the edamame is a great starter with a glass of wine .
it had no spice whatsoever ... .it was confusing and disappointing .
the naan was incredible , of course .
all were wonderful ! that with a bottle of wine and a dessert -- -- was around $ 125 .
the service we received was really bad .
their food is delicious , the wine list extensive and the service on point .
the lobby is beautiful and romantic , and the wait staff is really friendly . the whole place is `` cool '' without being pretentious .
i honestly am pretty shocked that a company as a whole could be so unprofessional .
the food was good . service was slow , even ordered ahead and waited a good 20 mins .
i was n't a true fan of the harley davidson memorabilia scattered all about the entire walls but i can see how it can appeal to certain demographic , it just was n't for me but the television was distracting enough to hide away from the decorations .
both of us went with the late night menu , she got the caesar salad to start and a rib steak for the main , and i got the salmon tartar and a rib steak as well ( i 've heard amazing things about their rib steak ) .
lunch special prices is at $ 25 for option of three things .
this is our favorite date spot in dtw .
on the contrary , the ribs were a bit on the tough side but the bbq sauce , which we got on the side had a bold flavor but nothing particularly special about it . the side dishes were very bland .
there was a green stain on one of the bathroom towels and everything was just dingy , stained and disgusting .
they have a full bar and i enjoyed a himalayan rum drink .
the salads are great and so are the regular and sweet potato fries . you have to try the fry sauce too and they even offer banana , sweet , and hot peepers on the side- free !
ordering feels a little awkward at first , due to its cafeteria-like style .
love this restaurant group .
margaritas had no alcohol in them yet they were the `` special '' of the night .
if i lived in the area , i 'd definitely give it another try , because everything looks so good .
nice spot in the hard rock , good sized bar and outdoor area with corn hole to keep you entertained while you eat and drink .
extra star for the interesting decor and funny ass signs posted around the place .
the chicken was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside and the biscuit was flaky and delicious .
their price is kind of expansive ( for buffets ) to start with so adding that $ 20 per person really made it expansive .
great prices for the value .
if i had to hear the drunk lady tell her daughter and son-in-law how much she was ready for a baby any longer i may have offered to help that process along just to get her to shut up .
i tried the one with pears , which was absolutely delicious . the flavors came together really well , and it was overpowering in the sweetness of the pears .
we feel really lucky to live so near this place .
horrible hostess . waiter was half dead .
lighting was harsh too . not exactly sure why it felt that way , but very bright for a restaurant .
i will not complain about a martini that is only $ 4.50 .
they did n't deliver my full order and refused to refund me . pizza was good but i do n't like being stolen from
husband had the shrimp and grits ... which i got a small bite of ... and it was great !
soups are yummy . sushi is good .
the atmosphere in here is really the star , it has gas lamps at all the tables and is a great place to mentally escape the cleveland winter . the beer selection is good , especially for abita beers , and the nightly specials have some great deals .
it is vegas but price wise it 's going to cost you $ 30 per person for an app + main .
it 's sort of gothic and kind of trendy , but mainly just weird .
our issue with this place was the our waitress , who was overly fake friendly and borderline rude .
when misti y and i stopped by she was able to sample a most refreshing mixture that contained canton , fresh muddled raspberries , and ginger beer among other ingredients .
the draft and bottle beer selection is legit , but mostly focused on regional selections which was disappointing .
good beer selection with the opportunity to order pitchers rather than just pints .
anyway , great coffee and drinks and teas .
the cocktails were creative and delicious - a great way to start an evening .
it was monday night , ladies night , and they had fantastic dinner and $ 5 drink specials .
we came to vegas for a week vacation , we wanted to have tacos , check on yelp and found this place had great reviews.. this place has amazing fresh food .
it is n't cheap but it 's really really fair value .
we noticed that the décor seemed nicer ; the colors were more inviting and warmer ( and there was n't a bright fluorescent meat case ) .
for two people , expect to spend right around $ 25 to $ 40 depending on what you are getting .
bread tasted like it came off the super market shelf , not even olive oil could make it better .
we were looking forward to eating here as this place had a great reputation .
beer was cold but all the mixed drinks had almost no alcohol .
they need to change out some of their lightbulbs , as the dramatic lighting , despite being cool , was a bit sharp on the eye .
people also complain that the décor is outdated . i do n't know about that , but i liked the décor a lot .
there was n't anything spectacular about them , but they were n't terrible .
but the biggest kicker is their disgusting practice of charging $ 12 for a bottle for tap water .
6 beers on tap and only one watered down version if a beer , so that 's a plus .
ultimately , when i go out for a meal that 's costing a table of two $ 200 , i expect an experience .
my group have 5 kids under 11 and had to pay full price .
well needless to say at this point , i 'm offended beyond reason and i begin to lose it with the hostess .
one thing i found weird was that the lighting was too bright for a restaurant .
these servers looked dumpy and just bizarre styling !
the portions are the perfect size .
could use more indoor seating but it has a great vibe for talking or studying . i would n't come here with more than one person at a time , but you can def enjoy a couple hours here easily .
for the drink i got the peach bellini - loved it !
the steak wedge salad is divine - comes with red and golden beets and asparagus plus a delightful little steak and covered in awesome blue cheese .
for what they charge and not having to deal with the terrible traffic of vegas especially at night .
they dont even deserve one star , poor customer service , treating customers unfairly .
it means business is good , and that 's probably because the food is great and prices are cheap
the only thing preventing a 5 stat is the dated carpet and furniture .
the prices are fair and affordable .
no draft beers which was a bummer , but still a decent selection of bottled beers .
it was a drab design with pretty pathetic food .
the foie gras was overwhelmed by the `` salsa '' served with it . the $ 60 kobe steak was not cooked rare , as ordered , and was surprisingly dry and generally blah .
no alcohol this trip , but they do have a full bar , with 5 beers in tap .
the atmosphere in ra is a bit pretentious , fake and noisy . but i actually like the place .
i was so disappointed in this place ... service was terrible - the waiter could n't be bothered and was rude ... took 20 minutes just to get a drink and we had to ask for menus ! food was ok !
the flavor was so delicious i will now only go with the hot & juicy flavor for now on .
the marinara is yummy for the garlic knots and i realllllly loved the shrimp scampi .
owner antonio and his staff are classy and fun . wonderful experience .
it 's a very good value .
super shitty food that will cost you an arm and a leg ( at least ) .
they have decent prices for good food .
all for about $ 20 , a good deal .
the burger , while good , was n't near the best as it was a little dry and tasteless .
crab puffs were burnt and the spicy chicken salad ( have ordered this many times before ) was terrible .
the only problem : its really small and elbow to elbow seating is n't really pleasant .
i thoroughly enjoyed my halibut - cooked to perfection , and my brother enjoyed the veal .
it feels kind of awkward .
dropping by this beautiful steak house on my wife 's birthday .
not a huge fan of frosty glasses for craft beer , but it was n't so bad that there was an iceberg floating in my beer or anything .
the drinks were also delicious ! the lemon drop martini and shots especially .
there was a good size cocktail list and our waiter also made great cocktail recommendations .
buster 's , you 're doing it right !
the food was nothing special ( korean tacos , meatballs and calamari ) , the menu seemed confused with a bit of an identity crisis .
price : very reasonable and cheap for the amount of food you get .
five stars for food . the sole reason for one star is the unappealing glaring cold fluorescent lighting in this place .
the grapefruit drink with basil was completely amazing and refreshing .
drinks were awesome , best dirty martini we 'd ever had !
weak service , beer on tap was two things : warm and stale .
the $ 5 lunch special is a great value i highly recommend it .
the eggs were decent but served on lettuce , hot eggy lettuce kinda odd .
once i had a seat at the bar and was fed free samples of japanese beer and sake until i was fairly buzzed .
we were a little disappointed in the portion of chicken for $ 8 lunch special . the noodles were dry in our pad thai and not much flavor .
nothing special to warrant their prices .
the bartenders are always very friendly and personable . they have an incredible beer list ( draft and bottled ) , as well as cocktails and daiquiris downstairs .
we also ordered a bottle of rose champagne , it was a great compliment to our meal , everything from start to finish was executed well .
view was nice even through the rain .
décor is not bad .
everything was spectacular ! the yellowtail was fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious .
but minus 2 stars for having a creepy guy in the bathroom .
we have been to lure many times and are always happy .
i love this place but hate hate hate the crappie scribbled on walls for decor ... .
price is very reasonable .
my husband enjoyed his mac and cheese but especially enjoyed the corn bread .
minus one star for the filthy over spilling trash can that could have been taken care of before the rush of 30 people who followed me in line .
all for only $ 14 !
and it was a huge drink .
location is slightly awkward inside with bad lighting but not too bad .
the food is fairly cheap and delicious .
decent food and very , very inexpensive .
they have an excellent selection of meats and wine and all sorts of little food items- pasta sauce , rolls , spices ... etc .
the server are the worst ever , you have to remain them to refill your drinks .
so , $ 50 does n't seem that bad for the ayce ( not cheap but not outrageous ) .
i had the cheese cake and creme brulee , both fabulous .
all you can drink for $ 2.50 , fresh and delicious .
further in , the tall dark bar with teal velvet seating , looked inviting and comfortable .
we started with the queso , which was delicious , and perused their extensive list of sipping tequilas .
the decor was so bad it was distracting .
the patio doors where open so there was nice breeze .
but the real attraction for me was being able to simply sit right on the vegas strip and take in the nice street view across from the bellagio .
not the best one but with friends and a cocktail pitcher that 's perfect .
the margarita was weak but ok and there is no way to screw up a cold corona !
delicious food and drinks .
i tried the sangrias happy hour for the first time . they were tasty and a great deal .
i finally tried this spot on wednesday for lunch , and then wednesday night for dinner , and then thursday for lunch !
please go ! definitely our new favorite neighborhood joint .
a small notice was given along with the bill to every customer , saying `` outstanding service '' deserves 15 % tips .
the flavoring of the meat was pretty good , but it 's really hard to enjoy a cold breakfast when you were expecting a hot one .
to the most expensive plate being $ 5.25 .
the decor is a little tired , hole in the wall - but not horribly off putting .
seriously . the guy behind the register said he could n't leave the register if he had customers ( because i was n't one ) , and he could n't ask anyone else to get some hand soap , because he could n't leave the register .
order the homemade lemonade to drink , it 's so good !
lovely brunch menu . however , the best feature of this place is the patio with a serene view of the lake .
for some reason i 'm not a big fan of the stained glass ceiling - it does weird things to the lighting and is distracting and i find it to be just the tiniest bit gaudy .
by far the best sushi in mooresville ! we live in virginia and every time we come down to the lake we make it a point to eat sushi here .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
price is $ 24.99 pp for the weekend which i think with the variety food they had should only be $ 16.99 .
it is a little expensive but i never thought it was outrageous .
but for $ 5 an appetizer and half-priced drinks , my husband and i had a wonderful date night without breaking our bank .
it was nothing special .
make sure you show your photo id when ordering and it 's only available on the day of your birthday , not before nor after .
such as pillows , fabric , and the lighting hung in weird places .
and it does n't really matter what you order -- everything is bland , bland , bland .
the drinks are good and they have some fun , fruity drinks like the key lime martini .
i had the best bloody mary ever - spicy with a sausage , candied bacon and a shrimp on top !
i got the avocado bahn mi tacos , and they are possibly the best tacos i have ever had- the tempura veggies inside are delicious . my date loved the cuban sandwich .
it came with a full bottle of champagne and three homemade juices .
i am afraid if we go again and it is bad , we may think they are no longer the same company .
naan was hot and fresh and tasted sooo good , your choice of garlic or plain .
place an order online nothing was right . no cheese or not toasted and almost my teriyaki chicken was ice cold .
my husband and i finally decided to get take-out from this place after hearing great reviews .
the food is ok but the customer service is terrible .
really trendy , cool place . a great late night scene .
beer was ok , but not quite cold enough . nice bartender but a second bartender was needed .
i 'm all for fresh food , but we ended up waiting an additional 20 minutes for our order to be ready : ( i have come here just for bubble tea before - if you plan to do this make sure you have at least 15minutes to wait for it .
great place great experience with family .
it is no loud i do n't think there is any insulation in the walls . the room is dirty i know they did n't clean the mirror has stuff all over it .
at first it was $ 4.99 for a salad , then $ 6.50 and now its $ 9.60 which is pretty steep considering what you get .
it was pretty good , the noodles were a little hard to bite through , but the flavor was good .
i love coffee shops , and one of my hobbies is to check out coffee shops , sit there , read books , or just browse internet while enjoying the comfort of a nice coffee shop .
was drinking bottle beer so hard to not get that right .
the chicken looked like something that was prepackaged , was cold and very rubbery .
was with group of my girlfriends on sunday afternoon and they had mention going to top shelf for sunday lunch , i had never been and thought ok cool lets go , i love trying new places out !
the poolside is immense with an ample amount of lounge chairs , towels , and umbrellas .
because cheers to airport food that 's actually really great !
$ 4 for a tiny , plain taco is insane .
they barely had any beers on tap , had no jack daniels , but did make a pretty good moscow mule .
to start , the interior has a beautiful ambience . the atmosphere is very high tone , and you can tell you 've stepped into a classy restaurant .
i love the garlic oil they put on the crust too , and the toppings and cheese just melt ( literally ) in your mouth .
finally got a chance to try this place after walking by it many many times on nights out in dtlv and it did not disappoint .
not the biggest bowl but the wontons were huge which is nice . only downside is that all the food was bland .
the happy hour is fantastic ! the barrel-aged cocktails are half price .
no good . clean but weird decor .
nice drink selection as well .
the employees had great attitudes and it ink about 20 minutes for the food to get done .
the beer selection is great , and i 'd say reasonably priced .
they were decent . nothing special .
but they were so unpleasant , especially compared to the old business that was in the same location before them .
we loved the wine too so they let us buy some bottles to take with us .
meatheads is good but not great at $ 11.50 .
the decor was atrocious ( i would rather not have to look at a statue of a naked man while i am eating ) and the walls were covered in pictures of half-naked people and pin-up girls .
unfortunately , i am not a craft beer drinker , but they did had a very large beer selection .
not friendly and while their outdoor seating is pleasant , that is the only positive comment i can make about this place .
the wait was n't too bad ( about 45 minutes ) , but the parking was a hassle .
they only had three flavors of beer and all of them were unknown to a beer drinker .
the hubby 's main dish ( it was a special ... do n't remember what it was ) was very good though .
the food is very good and reasonably priced .
the patty would have been better if it had a crispy exterior , it was more like a medium hard bun and was not appetizing . the filling was just okay .
bathroom was pretty dirty , soap was out of dispenser and just thrown up on the sink .
the price was very good ( 10 $ after tax ) .
we loved the wedge salad and the new cauliflower crust ! great service and meal !
the prices are modest .
it was only $ 8.50 . what a deal .
the hummus with the hot sauce is killer ! also , love love love the shishkabob salad with the sweet tangy tomato dressing .
jose was great ! it was my first time , and he gave me great recommendations on what to order , and had a smile on his face the whole time ... great food and service !
prices were very reasonable .
the prices are reasonable .
there are better restaurants in the area that treat customers kindly - i will never return to this place and i know no one in our party would ever return there .
the sides were just ok , again nothing spectacular .
no beer on tap , though , which is disappointing .
tried the lox and bagels and really enjoyed it !
quite tasty and a good selection for 10.00 dollars .
we loved our cocktails and the $ 3 shot special .
staff was very friendly as well and recommended a bottle of wine for the table .
cheese was good and not too greasy .
it was far from lovely .
the waiter there was great very helpful .
i figured since we were practically the only people in there that our food would come out somewhat quickly , but it still took awhile .
low prices and fantastic food .
blah . no one was mean and bottled beer is bottled beer but i might as well have stayed home .
i really loved the patio .
ca n't go wrong for under $ 10 .
the only thing preventing a 5 stat is the dated carpet and furniture .
she kept a good pace of us never needing anything and being a part of the experience but never made it feel as if she was over doing it or intruding .
oh , and reeeeally weird art in the girl 's bathroom ... .
the choice of music is perfect .
if you enjoy paying super premium prices for an ordinary steak then you 'll love this place .
4. this may sound weird , but there are heavy plastic coverings on the tables that make the dishes stick to the table .
their food is so delicious and anything with ricotta cheese is my favorite !
but then again we were the only sit down customers at the time .
we love it will continue to return .
quaint , but weird venue and too small .
at close to $ 30 per pizza , it 's definitely not on the cheap side either .
the food is exceptional , but at around $ 100/person that 's expected .
the wine was good though .
only a couple simply decorated tables added a great touch to the cozy atmosphere . the food .
china go-go ... do n't be turned off by the simple and relatively awkward decor .
the rest of our table ordered cocktails and they got their drink except me : ( anyway , not a big deal .
good place for a cheap drink .
the food was edible but not good .
horrible food , crappy lighting , and the monkey sound effects i can do without ! the flashing lights and animal cries are just plain disturbing to have going off while one is trying to eat and enjoy thier company !
the decor , probably lol
for $ 8.95 this is a delicious steal .
service here is impeccable comparing to other hotels i 've been to . love it trump !
the bad : old furniture , plates , glasses , decor and horrible paint job .
nice little patio area , but again , it 's pretty hard to get me away from those leather couches .
for a $ 1.50 each it can seem pricey to other people but once you taste the taco you understand why it 's ok to spend $ 1.50 per taco the sitting area is really nice in winter months here in az they have standing heater lamps everywhere while you eat ina enclosed tent .
the tortilla soup ... .seriously ... . their tortilla soup is killer here , not you grandma from mexico made it good but a whole different kind of good .
had a delicious chef 's salad and blueberry pie smoothie today , both made with freshest ingredients .
also , it 's very reasonably priced .
horrible lighting , very cute painting on wall , the food is not bad , but for the price ... it should be better .
so delicious ... the dressing was perfection . also went for brunch and everything was awesome .
beer choices were weak , wine choices were fine .
3. the drinks were pretty good , my wife had the honey gin martini drink and it was solid . my first drink was the prisoners manhattan , also the most expensive cocktail on the main menu ( not the ipad ) , and i was extremely disappointed .
the chicken curry rolled is my fav .
i highly recommend this place .
not sure why but we do n't come here more .
anyway , i took advantage of the happy hour beer specials , but unfortunately i really hated the second beer ( something by deschutes that i think might have been skunked ) .
the accompanying chicken breast is moist and delicious .
server was friendly enough and service was ok. both the wings and tofu soup i ordered were bland but not terrible .
great food and decently priced .
my absolute only criticism is for the dark haired male manager who , instead of correcting his staff privately , berated them in front of a bunch of customers and called them unprofessional , loudly .
prices are very fair .
they have a pretty good beer list , though nothing on draft .
their wine list and recommendations were good .
room was great , clean and cool . beautifully decorated , just very poor execution with the pools etc
to begin with the tables , booths , fake plants and sagging ceiling tiles are any combination of worn out , dirty or sticky .
the meal was about 60 dollars . totally not acceptable for the price .
our meal at liverpool house was excellent and the best way to start our trip to montreal .
honestly i felt like i was paying for the interior decoration and building .
but the food was good . loved the chicken noodle soup and the triple decker .
good value for the money .
the decor looks pretty modern but i do n't know why i still felt the place felt a little gross or dirty . just a weird feeling .
pizza was cold and did not taste good at all .
the prices are kind of high but it 's not bad considering the quality of food .
strong , hot coffee all around , and a blackberry green tea for me .
even though they were pretty busy , the server still checked on us and our drinks were refilled without even having to say a word .
great happy hour and service . extensive drink selection .
great service and love the fruit infused water and the spectacular menus .
i enjoyed the apricot beer , and they give you a huge bottle ( 500ml ) .
our waitress was very clueless about our orders but at least she was nice . she gave us the wrong things in our specific orders and even forgot to bring me my plate even though she saw me without one until i reminded her .
i do n't know why , but the entrance feels weird , like its cluttered or just too confined .
and the dollar value is awesome . the prices are super reasonable , but the portions are huge !
very nice , wonderful personality , and keeps the place clean .
rude staff members . subpar food for the price .
how can service be this bad when we prepaid and they know their counts on # of people coming ?
( too bad i got take out ) the lighting is quite dim .
place was nice and hip though .
the are good for the price , you get what you pay for .
the food is good and the price is reasonable .
i love this place . the gentleman who does delivers is quite friendly .
my $ 50 steak was dry , overcooked and had little to no flavor .
the front desk people were obviously we 're not happy with their jobs .
food is always delicious ( the chicken korma is addicting ) .
at $ 3.25 per sandwich , that 's a good deal .
they have great drink options , delicious food , and a beautiful view .
nachos and no beer does not make me happy .
the drinks are fairly priced .
this was another example of poor service , especially for this level of restaurant , based on the prices .
the one thing i noticed is that the decor is either intentionally older or very outdated .
the workers were so rude not even smiling .
heavy on the teriyaki sauce , very few vegetables and the chicken looked and tasted like it had been sitting there for hours : actually hard and tough and there was only about 2 tablespoons worth of chicken , i kid you not , i ended up throwing my meal away .
prices at little high for what you get .
great value for food and novelty , esp for 6 course $ 60 cad `` anniversary '' ( with a bajillion amuse bouches .
food tasty and very reasonably priced .
live music and a good vibe .
some people have complained about the decor and how the orange walls and 2 paintings on the walls are boring .
very reasonably priced with good service .
i was stuck with like 3 thin strips of rare beef .
we were a little disappointed that we could only get white rice .
it tastes so fresh and each bite is packed full of flavor .
we took a break and sipped on some more of the amazing drinks .
cocktails and wine were delicious .
the sangria is delicious as well .
i would have assumed he could not do anything but he made arrangements for me . i tried to tip him but he refused and said his tip would be if i had a good time , all by the way genuine .
never saw the waitress again after we placed the order until it was time for the check . when the food arrived , it was only lukewarm and despite my attempt to flag down a waiter to refill our drinks , we were basically ignored .
me being a beer drinker they had a decent selection .
5. good environment , could have better seats .
this is my go-to on a cold day or if i think i 'm coming down with something .
they have some great seafood platters though and some nice cocktail choices aswell .
took my aunt and uncle here , every time they are in town they wish to visit this restaurant . we are never disappointed .
i did n't see one decent beer on tap or in the coolers .
we both liked the sliders , tho i 'm not confident the mushrooms were there , as i did n't taste any .
they have a huge selection of food here for a very cheap price !
prices were unbelievably reasonable as well .
i have been here now in nc for 4 months and still trying out different places to eat .
we arrived late for our reservation ( sorry : ( ) but the waiter was very understanding about it and did n't even rush us even with another reservation for our table only an hour from the time we arrived .
this place was very convenient to my hotel , which was great . the service was friendly and attentive .
good for sunday brunch , food portion is smaller but quality is n't so bad . their second floor patio is the place to go , well , in the summer ... $ 4 mimosa is great for a breezy sunny weekend brunch on that patio .
beer selection was decent but not many light beers were available . drink menu was impressive .
the food is good and the prices are fair .
they have a great happy hour and an awesome bar staff .
yup yup you read right , the theme of the entire restaurant changes .
it came out with burnt ham and somehow was cold . burnt and cold ?
they offer a larger kind of oysters , 10 for $ 12 which is a nice change up .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
either take the entire list with you or have an ipad to be more organized and quit wasting time .
my wife and i stop in every month to grab a late night drink and an app .
good food for a good price .
we had a group of 7 , so the gratuity was added , and i feel like our waiter knew his tip was guaranteed and did n't give us great service .
35 dollars too . very expensive .
it 's relaxed , the bar has sports on the tvs and a fantastic menu .
what a cool place !
good price - great value .
carmon 's is a dingy little restaurant that has cute `` authentic '' touches here and there - fans that look like jet engines , mismatched salt and pepper sets , crappy paper menus shoved onto a clipboard , an antique cash register - but their menu lacks a certain something .
bartenders were fast and attentive , shot girls on the bar will pour shots for tips only , and they were everywhere .
i did n't think their sushi and rolls were to too exciting .
the drinks were pretty cheap ( wine , beer , margs ) but i do n't think they had any coors or bud on tap , which is unusual .
a bit higher price than i normally like to pay at a food court .
their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers .
the patio area is quite comfy , but the inside is just as nice .
the prices more than fair .
absolutely ridiculous and infuriating .
all prices are very fair and reasonable .
( full bar ) .
prices are very reasonable , and affordable .
then when it was time to pay , this woman gave us the bill and stood behind us until we pulled out a credit card .
the bartender was a nice enough guy but it just seem like the ownership or management was really supporting having customers at this place .
bad . absolutely terrible service .
server was nice polite . the place was quite .
the good beer was n't on special at all , and their `` domestic '' beers were all pretty much the crap i wo n't drink .
i did n't have any issues , but one of my friends was forgotten about ... leaving her with a bad client experience .
i finally decided to eat here when one of my friends recommended eating here , since she comes here on a regular basis .
i also ordered a few house margaritas on the rocks but unfortunately only `` frozen '' margaritas were part of happy hour .
love the sauce , too !
the food got an a plus and the iced tea was great too .
the lobster risotto came out first and was surprisingly delicious !
very good food , and super reasonable prices .
there 's a cute outdoor patio too .
good value for the money .
the price is fair too !
beer was awful and is n't even in a pint glass .
loved the liquor selection . they had a very thorough selection of whiskey .
there were an army of servers standing around on the patio , but only our server would help us , every 1/2 or so . there were so many employees , doing nothing but talking and gossiping with each other .
the wine list is small but mighty !
food was indeed very good and very reasonably priced .
recommend trying the cucumber mule drink . it was so refreshing and great drink .
the thursday burger special was $ 7.50 before , now it is $ 9.00 .
`` lady disposal can '' hanging off the stall wall , ghetto broken locks , auto flush button on the wall but not functional ... wow .
it was happy hour so he got a beer that he loved , and i had a nice prickly pear tequila cocktail .
i was at an all day track event at baldwin high school and found this little gem on yelp !
prices were very reasonable .
we got lucky and there was patio seating available which gave us a perfect view of the bellagio fountains .
prices are very reasonable as well .
drinks were always full .
the miso was bland and just ok and the bento box was a bit expensive for the quality and taste .
i got the shrimp skewers and my boyfriend got the chicken skewers . both were delicious .
very friendly staff as well .
way too expensive for below average food .
it had an awful , almost garlicky flavour and there was way too much of it .
kind of creepy actually .
i had a pomegranate mojito which was super yummy - not too sweet and still able to taste the mint with a decent kick !
lunch specials are about 6.50 to 7 bucks and are very filling and absolutely delicious .
we started with a bottle of wine ( my colleague chose , so i 'm not sure which wine we had , but it was a good one - ha ) and , upon the server 's recommendation , the octopus appetizer .
just moved to the area and been wanting to try this place out and finally got the chance today .
went to this place for lunch and was impressed .
very disappointed with their pizza .
i 've never had the savory items here , i 've had only the sundaes and the desserts .
very nice over the phone and asked me what i needed .
it was so cool to read those letters .
not sure about the decor .
will definitely be going here again ! highly recommended !
they said there might be a wait but it should n't be very long .
parking is a pain in the a** the escalator is kind of scary due to the sideways movement ... and they 're actually really ugly .
we started out with some happy hour priced drinks .
love the tom yum koong , a seafood hot & sour soup ! we liked at a '3 '
it was very , very dry .
the atmosphere was great , except for the constant flickering of the track lighting ( it was quite distracting ) .
amanda was sweet , friendly , and most of all genuinely happy to help .
nice busy restaurant but probably should be called a bar .
quite a steal for their three course meal lunch special at 25 dollars per person !
and if you 're not willing to get rid of those lights or turn them off , put in warm bulbs -not cool .
it 's reasonably priced , fresh , and delicious .
and the fremont street experience - light show is pretty much right outside so it does make things convenient .
our waiter was attentive at first , but then began to flirt with the girl at the to-go counter and forgot all about us .
i also had a specialty drink recommended by our waiter which was very good and refreshing .
it is pricy ( almost $ 30 ) and at least 75 % of the time it 's pretty good .
the hot chocolates were rich , creamy and most importantly , delicious .
i do not order tap beer there , the selection is very weak anyway .
but when you did get service , it felt like you were the only table she had to deal with for the rest of the night .
not sure if they 're were short handed or just busy . i will say that there was only two seats open when we arrived but when the table next to us kept asking for their check repeatedly , then i knew i was n't the only one thinking they 're slow .
it is a little expensive but i never thought it was outrageous .
no response , whatsoever ... that 's poor service to me .
the food is reasonably priced .
decent place . it comes across as fancy but the prices are reasonable .
the lighting is just absolutely horrific .
the reason for the poor review is because of the customer service .
the draft list was n't bad but nothing out of the norm .
the price is ridiculously cheap .
food is good . fresh .
came here for happy hour with some friends and had a great time . all wines are $ 5 for happy hour before 5:00. ca n't beat that !
paid $ 28 each , kids 3 and under eat free .
tried this place after hearing good things about .
there 's no hard liquor , just beer and wine .
good service , tasty sushi .
the margarita was n't anything special either .
if i am going to pay $ 160 per person , i expect a good quality of meat and i was pretty disappointed with the main course .
another 10 minutes went by ( 20 minutes total ) , and wondering what was going on , my girlfriend rang the bell for service .
the chicken strips tasted like they were fried in old burnt oil .
20 minutes until we ordered and 45 minutes until we got our food . it was a saturday night with a full house and only 2 waiters who were nice but very overwhelmed .
all their pricing is very reasonably priced .
had i paid $ 30 for the steak , it would have been disappointing , but you get a great value at the $ 10 price point .
the decor is abysmal ; it looks like an applebees that has n't nailed all of the crap to the walls yet .
there interior design is `` interesting '' , not sure why there so into the zebra print but to each their own .
amazing bbq place ... all u can eat with very good service , delicious especially the octopus , very nice servers , clean and cozy . we kept coming back this is d best kbbq place for us !
it 's $ 2.60 for a 12 oz cup , which i suppose is reasonable .
good and very reasonably priced food .
great food for a cheap price !
wow ! i 'm glad i did .
i 'm ok with changing recipes up a bit but not only did it have very different vegetables that were so undercooked they were almost raw , the flavors did not even resemble a pot pie .
all the sandwiches are made on the spot with fresh ingredients . i loved the baguette they used which tasted fresh and had the perfect crunchy outer with a soft interior .
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
for such delicious lunch specials under $ 6 , you really ca n't complain . great flavour and portions .
not to mention our waters were always full even after we paid .
no matter how good the food is , i have issues with paying over $ 13 for a burger meal .
i ordered the shrimp scampi which was also yummy . we shared the mushrooms and were too full for dessert .
for a $ 400+ dinner for three it was mediocre at best .
and our sandwich was priced right at $ 12 .
before anything else , you notice the decor , lacking in bright pink , tacky gold plastic and neon lights i have grown to look for in a good pho place .
the salad was yummy , the fried chicken bites were delicious , the meat was tender and fun to cook .
the only awkward part was the ambiance .
good food for a good price .
heads up , it is a bit pricey though , just these 3 items on their own came out to $ 44 +tax
horrible service , dirty restaurant , and they charge you $ 1.89 if you want a water up ( unless you want one the size of 2 ounces ) . pathetic .
the beer list was disappointing .
very romantic date spot . watching the sunset after a monsoon storm is highly recommended .
just a comfortable place to eat at and hang out .
if you find yourself in downtown calgary with friends or colleagues and you 're having a hard time setting on one type of cuisine that suits everyone 's tastes , then head to marcello 's market and deli .
this place is pretty well known since i 've only just been here ( 1st time ) .
the service is as great as the food . derrick is a great server and goes above and beyond .
i had the osso bucco , which was good . the shank was nice and tender and juicy but the flavors were on the subdued side , risotto underneath was n't memorable .
good prices for good beer , especially being on the strip .
we wanted something with `` chips and salsa '' and a decent beer selection .
we asked for menus and sat down in the dining area . when we were finally acknowledged after waiting to order , our server seemed very hostile .
on top of that the bathrooms were disgusting . water and liquids everywhere , soggy paper towels on the ground and rags sitting around in the stalls and on the sink .
we ended up paying almost 200 canadian dollars for very average cafeteria food . service was generally good tho .
the patio is amazing .
the presence of a server alone put me in an awkward position , but when she frequented to my table , sending a signal that i 'm no longer welcomed , it was time to leave .
i do n't post on yelp , but i will for this place , which is exactly what you want in a casual cantina experience . great food , very warm and friendly staff
and , the room is very bland ... .. just beige walls .
i do n't think they were intentionally loud , or any louder than any other hotel , just that the doors and walls were that thin .
maybe it 's because of the outrageous pricing .
surprised that there were a few true craft beers ( in bottles , no taps ) .
great food , nice and open where you can see the pool and outside patio .
i always tip well and after the subpar service today i may reconsider visiting again . they are rude and not attentive .
awesome experience zach was great constantly checked in on us .
i think this is partially due to the thicker cut but also it had the nice chewy fatty gristle attached to it .
i was n't super impressed with this experience since aroma just blew me away a few weeks ago .
started with salads and hummus both times and they were both very good .
i like to to be reasonably priced .
the draft list was n't bad but nothing out of the norm .
food was just ok , nothing special . had home cooked food way better than this .
and they have some good beers for the pitcher not .
even the margarita was bad .
i 've loved everything i 've eaten here . seafood potpie , ratatouille crepe , and the pavlova is a must try !
however , it was pretty frustrating because they waited until the whole order is ready before serving it .
very expensive ( $ 52 for breakfast for 2 , not including tip ! )
this place has a great vibe and atmosphere .
in my great adventure of trying new foods , i found this cute little place . now i had heard about pho and wanted to try it , they have so many options and such good food i want to go again tonight ... .in fact i might try to go again !
our server josh was exceptional . very attentive and gave great suggestions .
all in all it was not terrible , but it was at best ok .
all in all this place is reasonably priced and turns out decent food .
the frosting probably hardened overnight so it came off easily .
luckily the bus boy got is cold ones since our waitress did n't seem to care .
the environment was very unique with a cute patio with unique furniture .
i had the house salad with homemade balsalmic vinaigrette dressing and it was good !
very good menu - lot 's of variety , moderate prices - but it is value !
i told her what i originally ordered and that 's when she started to get attitude , like it was my fault she got the order wrong .
we asked for 8 originally and then asked for 6 instead because 8 would be too many .
great food and drinks !
decent price point considering the location .
he schezwan chicken and hunan shrimp were very good but not enough spice . the shrimp was big and very tasty .
so glad i finally tried this place !
overall , a pretty good choice with great food , very reasonable prices .
i love the decor , the food is delicious , friendly service . my new place to visit each time i 'm in vegas .
the bathroom is dirty , which was turn off for me .
the bathrooms have some of the weirdest art up on the walls of butts and elephants doing suggestive things and fat people and naked greek statues and every weird , crude , amusing thing you can think of .
all this can be yours on a cold winter night for $ 8 plus tax and tip !
prefab is ok for cheap housing and fast food , but not for a place that charges about $ 10- $ 12 per person for breakfast .
that and the walls desperately need paint , place just does n't feel clean .
the cheese was excellent and the toast points were perfect .
i told the girl that that was unacceptable and that i needed to be sure that i was getting turkey sausage .
so then she brings one whole check and were kinda confused .
the portions are sliced very thin , but i 'd rather have that than big pieces of poor quality .
picture nooks and crannies , warm fire places and fire pits , a great patio , waterfalls ... .its fantastic .
not sure why it has only two $ $ in the listing .
love coming here in the morning , the morning staff is great ! i wish service would go faster in the morning though .
i ordered the tenderloin which was great while my boyfriend ordered baked penne pasta , the sauce was watered down and tasteless , it reminded us of canned pasta .
ladies , careful when wearing heels ... the floor is slick , or maybe it 's how i walk .
it was 3:30 in the afternoon and it was n't terribly crowded so there are no excuses .
i also really like the service , everyone was super kind and made great suggestions .
wow . its the best fried chicken i 've ever had hands down !
they had a good selection of bottled beers but nothing on tap .
excellent place . gyros are amazing mixed grill platter was good lamb chops were again superb i want to try the calamari next time i go there almost every week now reasonably priced too
the only thing lacking is the interior decorating .
other than somewhat cold food and pushy wait staff , the food itself would have been good .
the crispy crust on the sea bream was impressive .
( on the menu it was marked as $ 30 for the bottle , on my bill they hit me for $ 50 ... so beware ! )
good food w/ interesting combination of ingredients .
however , the breakfast potato it came with was very bland .
unfortunately they only have a few mixed drinks , beers , and wines - no full bar .
the onion marmalade that went with perfectly cooked steak was delicious .
the acoustical guitarist added the perfect touch to a wonderful meal .
she 's only 6 and i had kept her entertained for 15 minutes until she kept wondering why it took so long to receive her pizza .
the hotel was nice , and the room was very nice .
it was steamed perfectly too .
the food is pretty decent and great drink prices .
beer selection was good , but a gastropub should have unique vessels for drinks . cider in a guinness pint glass is just ... .wrong .
hand crafted cocktails were excellent but a bit overpriced for an off strip bar beer taps were down for repair but there were ipas and other bottle and canned options .
it 's only $ 7.00 on the weekend and it 's credit card only . the manned lot is $ 10 and cash only .
arrived on time , and was told , we will see , we are behind , we will let you know .
price was very reasonable .
hardly any tequila in it .
they have a nice cocktail menu and mocktails as well .
kind of cheapens it even though it 's kind of cute .
-1 : a bit annoying that they do n't have a bathroom inside .
service was great , ca n't remember our servers name but she was friendly and efficient .
great value for the price .
the service was horrible .
if it was full price ( $ 31 ) i would have been upset .
the beer was good , but the margarita came with no more than an inch of the glass rim salted ( `` is n't that bartending 101 ?
the meal costing $ 50 along with the price of the ticket made this a very expensive evening .
it would be nice if they could get rid of the tags in the men 's room , the graffiti is just kind of ugly and detracts from the rest of the place .
i highly recommend them .
and the chirashi was not cheap , it 's $ 20 and we paid about $ 80 for just this simple lunch .
what a great view while dining .
refried beans were very bad tasting , enchilada was edible but it was n't tasty . disappointing
the food and service are always good at nello 's . we always make one or two trips here when in town for business .
their service was wonderful . i also enjoyed having the iced tea !
the dinner combos are of decent prices , so you get a couple pretty good deals !
mood : needed to drink but needed some food : ) order : i ordered the fried chicken po ' boy ( recommended by waitress ) and guinness / with shot of jameson .
the decor of the fake palm tree and wooden tiki statue was a little tacky , but again , did not deter me from ordering : - ) .
not expensive at all .
the drink had a discount of $ 3.75 off of the original $ 7.99 .
the parking lot is small and awkward not always easy to find a spot in . and the restaurant itself sitting between a gas station and tire spot does n't really scream `` sexy dining experience '' .
it was not a luxardo which is ok but it was warm mushy and disgusting .
not having beer descriptions in a beer bar is just wrong .
the berry mixed drink was amazing !
never going to be as great as a premium parlor 's pizza , but for $ 5 you ca n't go wrong .
the meat used in any of the kabobs is top notch . i love the bread .
rooms were 80 's chic , exterior was dirty stucco , and finding someone to help with luggage near impossible .
their patio is small , but great for the summer .
i love a wine bar .
the atmosphere is nice when the front windows are open but otherwise it 's loud and stuffy .
i have honestly had better strips from wal-mart and albertsons ( no exaggeration ) .
the waiter forgot my order and i had to hunt them down 3 times to ask if the order was ready yet . when i finally got the dish , i was getting ready to leave .
the only time we really received service was when we paid for our dinner .
the decor was atrocious ( i would rather not have to look at a statue of a naked man while i am eating ) and the walls were covered in pictures of half-naked people and pin-up girls .
just checked out this new restaurant and jovany was our server and he was upbeat , friendly and super sexy covered in tattoos !
in addition , portion sizes were quite good for the price .
i rarely find a place i like this much so this was a treat .
you pay $ 15 bucks for a salad and not so great soup and bread .
for 25 $ i got a small dish full of only souse and some bitter veggies .
this place has some unique character inside and they outside searing as well .
the staff was very nice and friendly .
this is just another chain breakfast and coffee joint but this location is amazing for those two ladies who are running the show in the morning .
service is very friendly .
it is totally overpriced .
also , quite reasonably priced for what you get .
so not only is the food good , but it is 100 % worth the price
its got a great location because there 's a man-made lake just around the corner .
the four of us ate outside at the ivy on a beautiful may evening .
kimmy was a delightful server , prompt and provided suggestions with the food . all the wait staff was very efficient .
reasonably price and nice environment .
the prices are very reasonable as well .
i had to take each piece out and cut it apart to get very little meat . sandwich had good flavors but with crumbs of meat i felt ripped off ... 2. my wontons were fried to a crisp ( wish i remember to take a picture ) .
ordered a chicken fajita wrap which i always do and once again disappointed smallest thing i 've seen , it looks like it should of been for a child .
three , it 's not like we were given a free bottle of wine .
for future reference : at about 2 blocks from the east/west blvd light rail stop , it 's a perfect distance for a crawl .
this place seriously needs to get it 's reservations system in order .
horrible happy hour total rip off do n't waste your time .
with the talk ceilings it was very loud , the manager said they were going to install curtains to help absorb some of the echoes . i really think they need to install some sound absorbing foam tiles on the ceiling .
ticket prices are very reasonable for what you 're getting .
i would also recommend one of their mixed drinks during your meal , my favorite is the fruit cocktails .
i was a but disappointed that it was n't a greens salad but it was still pretty good .
to be honest the decor is bizarre .
this place is hidden and crazy good . the sit down area is entertaining and perfect for families .
big tables , fans , tvs and not over bearing music made it nice .
i placed a to go order with the bartender and she was very helpful in describing the sauces and made some very delicious suggestions !
seriously over priced ! beware , almost $ 30 for 6 oysters .
the best fried chicken you 'll ever have !
worse off the fettuccini and chicken alfredo the sauce tasted like spoiled milk .
this was dirty with filthy , greasy floors . i mentioned to the waitress that they were insects on the wall beside our and she shrugged her shoulders and asked me if i wanted more barbeque sauce .
men 's room was not even close to clean with tissues in shoved in all facilities and no paper towels or hand dryers and no hand soap .
prices were very reasonable .
the service at this place is always good and friendly .
the service was alright - our waitress was training a new employee and the trainee was awesome . however ; the actual waitress was not the most attentive .
bad reviews based off of parking are rediculous .
the traditional dishes including fried rice , orange chicken , and chow mein are tasty and fresh . my favorite is the vegetable chow mein with tofu and double cooked pork .
luckily , neither my fiance or i got sick .
fast , fresh , hot food for $ 7.50 lunch specials . good choice if you are in the area !
amazing . we had to stop here twice during our 4 day stay .
clean the bathrooms ( shit stains , used tampon on the floor ) !
dude , it 's not clean .
bathroom ( singular ) were dingy but clean for the most part .
server was friendly but not very attentive .
kinda loud -- could use some sound baffling -- but a comfortable location in a fun neighborhood .
the cherries was such a perfect compliment to the meat of the squab .
pretty good wine selection i guess , i 'm not a wine guy . not much of a beer selection for being a beer and wine bar .
we tried the 'small ' size calamari for the appetizer , it was very good and perfectly crunchy , for our main entree we had the 'small ' size chicken carbonara . the food was very good and flavorful , for two of us we did n't finish it and had to take our leftovers with us .
i do n't understand the good reviews .
service : from the hostess to management , i was really impressed .
food/drinks are reasonably priced which is good , but are not amazing in terms of quality .
this was a first visit ! it was a great experience .
the prices are very good as well .
not only did i have to wait for 5 minutes to order but they ran out of produce so i guess no wrap for me .
about the drinks : - good selection of cold sake . - it 's not the place for sake bombers .
prices are very high so expect to spend a good amount but that is expected as this is known for high class dining .
lunch specials are decently priced but quality of food was great ! service is just as awesome !
kind of looks trashy .
the pirate show is cool but that 's about it .
wish he was our server ... atmosphere was weird ... i expected it to be dark and hyper masculine , after all it is a steak house , but the wood paneling and extreme darkness was unnerving .
it 's quite an interesting and refreshing mix of casual and intimate all at the same time .
it 's a great place to dine in and get takeout .
kinda outdated ... but that adds to the appeal .
both were damn good and flavorful .
my favorite drink is the prickly pear margarita , and the other specialty drinks are very good .
we tried the grilled tilapia and the texas fajita . both were excellent and nicely grilled .
price are well , dirt cheap , for mediterranean .
i do n't drink with dinner but here it was happy hour all day sat , and they had a unique drink the curry gimlet , it comes in a martini glass has a orange hue , it is fruity but has a curry finish from cardamom i assume , truly unique .
a little too dark , but nothing annoying .
maybe we had a bad chef or something but my calzone had a lot of mushrooms in it , completely overpowering the rest of the meal .
it 's not cheap but it 's really good .
i do n't have to go into detail , it was a mild case of food poisoning . i do n't like to point fingers and throw the term `` food poisoning '' around lightly , however it had to have come from the pizza i ordered .
overall , the food was pretty mediocre and i expected better quality for $ 35 dinner buffet pricing .
the beer was cold and in a pint glass .
we each ordered a vodka & cranberry ; fairly strong .
i 've also come with friends for happy hour and just ordered appetizers and drinks .
quick , cheap , delicious .
it was super nice that she gave us that suggestion , she could have totally just gone on her way after taking our order .
gladly every dish i had was seasoned properly and tasted excellent !
not too mention , they have an awesomely unique layout to their shop .
i have to say that the service we received was good .
bartenders are friendly and drink menu is awesome .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
reasonably priced , great service .
the coolest part about the entire restaurant was the decor and i do not mean the bathroom !
we ordered the appetizer platter that was on special and the spring rolls were amazing !
of the food options , they are all pretty big portions .
as soon as you step out of the restaurant you have an awesome view of camelback mountain .
place is a total rip-off !
i was in the mood for a nice meal and a good glass of wine .
cute place . needs a patio tho .
oh yeah , and the restaurant itself is bad . bad spacing of the table , really small restaurant , bad ambiance .
i had a chicken hibachi meal and my friend had the salmon .
the bartender made me a special drink that was n't on the menu and it was one of the best drinks i have had in a long time ; tasty and strong !
maybe i just do n't care for minced chicken .
prices are not crazy .
the beer was cold , they have jameson and a tequila on draft and they serve tacos late .
the men 's bathroom had piss all over the floor and smelled disgusting .
it 's a lot bigger than it looks and the inside is gorgeous .
we definitely received a bad service over all .
yes , it 's expensive , but you get what you pay for .
great value , large portions and everything tastes oh so very fresh .
you only get 4 , which kind of sucks , at $ 10 .
sexual harassment should be expected if u go here .
3 stars because the price of the food is outrageous for the quality of the food .
the very self important manager came over and talked forever about how this policy was good for us ( spend up service or something ) . while this policy makes no sense , the bigger problem was that we were n't told and manager was not helpful , or nice , at all .
cool looking spot inside .
so ridiculous . they deserve a zero
the salsa had some weird seasoning in it , the burrito sauce tasted nothing like it should & the tortilla soup was bland .
this is very frustrating considering the price you pay .
plus the prices are a bit high .
good food . good prices .
i love this place . great food with a very cool upbeat vibe .
i was not disappointed .
, but it is a nice place , great ambiance , even dining solo at the bar .
the serving is huge .
but for $ 6 i 'd like more than 4. it 's too expensive to be this bad .
great thing was that the bar had happy hour all night !
i could tell you the whole story but the important things you need to know is the food is mediocre at best , the service is terrible , account for 40 min to get your food ( yes , for a sandwich ) , and know this is epitome of inefficiency .
easy access from airport especially when getting in late . ashley is great .
i also had the mesquite grilled prime rib-eye steak salad , which was a nice sized portion and tasted excellent .
not sure who came up with the whacked cocktail menu but fortunately they have a good selection of craft beer on tap .
i went on half price wine night during happy hour and sat at the bar .
well drinks are pretty weak , so i stick to beers .
we were also surprised to see such a nice bar , with local beer , a large wine list , and excellent cocktails .
service is absolutely horrible .
besides getting my order wrong they are still very disorganized .
the staff here were friendly and attentive so that coupled with excellent food is a win-win in my book !
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
everyone i went with really loved their meal . i ordered key lime pie for dessert and it was simply amazing !
it was fast , but what flavor it did have was crap .
felt a bit sick after words , so my assumption is that either the food was tainted or that i accidentally ate some sort of animal protein that my body is not able to digest well .
price : this place is pretty pricey which is expected with sushi , but i paid 16.50 for 6 pieces of sushi it that gives you an example .
i would make a strong recommendation for either these appetizers .
hard to justify almost $ 70 for casual dining .
only downside i can see if the price . though it is something different , paying such a high price for this burger , at this portion , is not the best .
that too was served 20 minutes apart . the hostess/owner apologized & said their was a `` mixup '' but i was n't impressed with the lack of concern that was given with our poor dining experience .
the food was cold and the bernaise sauce was icy .
very pleasant experience , really cute establishment with a great vibe .
i had the patron xo tiramisu and it was pretty good , i 'll try something else next time . we drank the $ 15 sangria pitchers and it was pretty good .
started with the spanish chorizo with shrimp and followed with the jamaican curry chicken and both dishes were amazing !
i 've been going to the location on charleston since the eighties . i 've been going to the cheyenne location since it opened and i have to tell you it 's always great .
not stuffy , not trashy , just right .
the wall menu decor was pretty cool .
not in the mood for wine ( as it was unbearably hot out ) i opted for a margarita .
soup base for both are good and tasty .
both the beverages and food are very reasonably priced and of exceptionally high quality .
i have experienced better . ( insert farting noise here )
the value is unbeatable ... great food , big portions , for a decent price .
came here for breakfast today and glad i did .
beer was awful and is n't even in a pint glass .
the doomed ceiling with the painted sky and lighting is fantastic .
i was full off this plate - $ 18 .
it was nice and cozy .
there wine selection was pretty good and the server was excellent at picking a wine for us as well .
i had the pulled chicken salad which was nothing special and the chicken was bland , no seasoning or marinade , which could have turned the whole salad around .
it was only $ 8.25 .
spring rolls are good . kids food choices are good .
restaurant was dirty and there was no soap in the men 's bathroom .
i ordered the beef donburi and it was absolutely delicious .
drinks are good and reasonably priced , cheap on hh .
all are amazing ! the have a full bar as well and they offer moscow mules too !
we got the bone in strip , and it was good but not as good as i would expect for the $ 60 price tag .
on a different note , the men 's bathroom was very messy and there was no soap or paper towels anywhere .
fortunately it was only $ 4 , so it was n't super expensive .
wow ! good wine list and accommodating server to let me try a taste before choosing a glass .
unfortunately for me it seemed bland and probably needed more seasoning .
our group also split a bottle of sake which was equally as refreshing . kanpai !
i highly recommend the chicken tortilla soup as it is n't very spicy and is dynamite .
beer - the beer selection was nothing special and they do n't serve it in a cold glass .
things were reasonable priced .
the food was good and reasonably priced .
this place had amazing design and atmosphere .
great happy hour , great service , great drinks .
a wonderful place to bring friends or family that are in town to visit
and the food prices are cheap !
not classy , i know .
but for close to $ 24 for two hotdog combos , it 's expensive for what you get .
both were delicious af . had my first sazerac drink ( $ 6 on happy hour ) and it was amazing .
i ordered the lavender rose iced latte , which was very refreshing for a hot day .
if you go to clever koi , you have to get the scorpion bowl ( pictured ) , which is a large drink with a bunch of different kinds of alcohol and fruit juices ( rum , gin , brandy , lime , oj , passion fruit syrup ) !
breakfasts are huge and about $ 13 , but they do n't mind two people sharing .
the food was great and he has a really nice wine and cocktail list .
do n't use the bathroom and do n't expect a clean interior .
it was a little creepy .
the place looks really nice and trendy , also the bathroom is very clean . the staff is super nice .
it would be 5 stars but their prices are a bit high .
decent food at decent prices . kid friendly menu too .
the lighting was harsh and the whole time i felt like i was in a cafeteria .
super awesome bagel sandwich . i had the bacon , egg , and cheese on a everything bagel , and it was amazing !
we ordered the gyro dinner , cornish hen and chicken cutlet and for appetizers we had the eggplant dip ( delicious ) and the taziki salad . all us were very pleased with everything we tried .
the clams were tiny , but good .
a fantastic experience at this true mom-and-pop shop .
very good food , very reasonable prices .
i did not ask for any special tequila .
we ate outside and enjoyed the nice weather .
the tempura batter used to fry the shrimp was thick and terrible , did not taste at all like tempura .
drinks were a little weak but draft beers worked well enough .
they had a generous happy hour ( 5-7 monday-friday with specials on wine , beer , liquor , and appetizers .
the ginger peach drink was refreshing : ) travis , our server , was very personable .
horrible customer service all around .
clean and good service .
false advertising ! be warned that what you see on their website is n't necessary what you are going to get .
i would also say the cleanliness of our table was bad but that may be the results of the poor skills of our server .
nachos and no beer does not make me happy .
when we arrived to pick up was surprised at the bill : - ginger chicken was $ 10 , now $ 14 ... ... a 40 % increase - cashew chicken was $ 10 , now $ 15 ... .. a 50 % increase - mango salad was $ 6 , now $ 8 ... . a 33 % increase .
my favorite dish is the lamb korma .
i booked rio because for 4 girls , 2 rooms with a strip view the total was $ 400 that 's a $ 100 each !
the atmosphere was ok ... a little too bright , they could probably lower the recessed lighting ... the lanterns above the tables seemed fairly bright .
as the economy picks up , so does the number of people that dine there , but that is not a bad thing .
went here one night and our queso came out cold so we asked for it to be heated and the guy rolled his eyes and then brought it out and said `` oh my gosh it 's so hot '' - joking and being very unprofessional .
cheap , quick , and tasty .
this is easily my favorite place to eat in phoenix .
delicious food ! i loved the green curry , and i also tried my friend 's pad thai and it was good .
we had a terrible experience at the patriot tonight .
most likely a waitress issue but who knows .
the serve yourself wine bar is perfect as well . great selection of wine and the service was awesome as well .
most of us got the fried chicken which was overcooked and just ok. you get three big pieces , more than you can eat at one sitting , but since it was overdone you did n't want to bring leftovers home .
the ambiance is super dark which i really draw to whenever i go to restaurants . you also have the option to sit on the patio which is small but it 's nice .
we ordered the lollipop passion goblet ! the drink was amazing and so cool !
it was completely bland .
you need to be prepared to spend about $ 100 per person , but you are going to have huge for portions .
the margarita was n't anything special either .
the manager was very nice about it and first suggested that the volume of fluid in the glass was similar to that of a regular martini glass which was kind of laughable .
the roasted pork belly is the only dish i 'd say is really fantastic ; crispy and delicious .
first of the space is huge and can host a large crowd which seems to be the theme for the restaurants/bars in the this neighborhood .
whenever i come here , this restaurant is almost always full !
service is great i went once weekday lunch and another time weekend lunch . service was consistent and attentive .
the interior design appears to be done by a blind person from the 80s .
beer selection good but server had no clue .
prices were very reasonable .
the atmosphere was great and the prices were cheap .
the pizza , of course , was excellent .
their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers .
great choices , duck topped poutine , spicy jambalaya , sweet potato sheppard 's pie with beef & lamb .
nasty and weak margaritas that were being poured from a bucket . plain entrees .
they staff was very friendly with fast service .
top notch food and service ! i loved the ambiance , the dim light gives an intimate feel .
the chicken kebob taste tender and flavorful especially when you eat it with tzatziki . and i am hooked on the orzo rice pilaf , it 's a nicely seasoned savory rice and they make it so fluffy and delicious .
i was impressed that the place is always busy and packed but the quality of food and service is excellent . it is probably the best mexican restaurant i have every been to and i have been to so many i can not count since i living in arizona and las vegas .
greg the bartender is great . food needs work .
i would say its a little tacky but clean .
not that i drink beer but they have huge beer selection , over a 130 beers on tap .
the decor everywhere screams pearls on swine -- an attempt to make something cheap and shoddy look fancy .
the sliders i ordered had nice bacon but the patty was the size of a fat quarter and the bun was a shriveled mass of tasteless substance that reminded me of the rolls you get at the holiday inn express continental breakfast , except not as good .
only bummer is that i did n't see any draft beer , only bottles .
the food took more than 30 minutes to come out between appetizer and entrée , and then our waiter mysteriously disappeared for about 30 more minutes without any explanation at all .
good food . prices are high .
went for sunday brunch & found a seat at the bar right away .
they had a decent draft selection and everyone said the margaritas were pretty good .
the location and ambiance are great . the food is stuck in the 90s .
not a drinker but friends love the choice of drinks .
the service was attentive , but not overbearing . i had the macaroni and cheese with bacon and it was delicious .
we love taking our out-of-town guests here to show we locals also have more nice places to go to off the strip .
then to top it off the marinara had a weird flavor .
highly recommend this restaurant .
choice of beers was n't to bad .
across the top it sad `` $ 8 per glass , $ 30 per bottle .
the decor was super cute as well !
i loved the bread with dipping sauce and the salad was great too -- very fresh with a great vinegrette dressing . the pasta was excellent as well with a very authentic , homemade sauce .
our favorite pub in las vegas . good food , great beer and close to the strip .
this place is awesome . wonderful ambiance , food is fabulous , and very pleasant servers .
not bad for only $ 20 .
only shining star was the decor .
customer service is non-existent , with the daughter behind the counter not even greeting customers or saying hello .
very impressed with couscous and shepherd 's pie with cow tongue brisket .
we were ready to be turned away cuz it was so late but they kindly invited us in , asked us if we would like the special & not wanting to be a pain we accepted . the waiter checked what kind of meat we were ok with & asked about spiciness then went to create us something .
the view is amazing , able to see all the action on the strip .
ribeye was good , it was n't $ 50 good though .
they also have a great cocktail list and beer selection .
i think she was 12. margaritas were hot and tasted like there was no tequila in it .
quail was quite good and the sauce accompanying it was delicious .
it was dry and flavorless .
the owner , curtis , personally stopped by our table to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and everything was perfect !
my favorite appetizers are the onion rings and chicken nachos .
stemmed like a typical bar with too many beers available , but did have my lame beer if choice coors light .
selection may not be the largest but it makes up for it in quality especially for what they charge .
the bartender is an expert because the drinks that we had are the best especially the long island iced tea .
if you could buy a $ 500 shirt in one of their shops , you of course should be surprised by the prices here .
the gravy was so bland , there was no flavour .
however , sushi was n't good at all .
earlier , when i asked server # 1 about my options , she pointed to that ramen dish as the only option for me .
i ordered tuna sashimi and am salivating right now remembering how amazing it was !
not a bad portion size however , the edamame were pretty sad looking .
it was all very cheap .
how dare they charge almost $ 7 for that crap !
big and cooked to a perfect crisp .
the price is very reasonable .
i have never tasted such bland food before in my life .
when drunk , finding the bathroom at remedy 's is like a mini maze .
the lobby was clean , bathroom was pretty dark and no toilet paper so they definitely need to keep an eye on that .
i grabbed an eclair as well and it was nasty , stale , and left a really bad after taste in my mouth .
pasta was cooked great but the sauce was just way too salty .
chicken was grilled and seasoned to perfection and the peri peri sauce was a fan fav .
$ 45 for the signature `` hickory smoked manhattan '' , unusual , a one time experience . sailor 's mojito , thick and sweet .
the only 2 beers available was budlight and `` house special beer '' which tasted like piss water .
disappointing . i get it 's new and quoted 45mins and it was 2hr wait .
if you 're willing to spend $ 100 per person for a meal then you 'd be advised that there are better places .
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
but for the price , it 's pretty good value !
i 've had different spicy tuna rolls before but what i got here was nothing short of tasteless fish mush .
decor is bad though lol
they have a wide variety of options and everything is fabulous .
went in for all you can eat pancakes on a slow monday night , ca n't complain about the food but the service was a little annoying , our waitress was a sweet girl but she made our experience seem rushed by bringing us the check real early when we were n't even halfway done with our meal .
i do n't mind spending money at the airport for a good drink and grub , but our $ 60 dollar tab was a huge disappointment .
decent but not with the unnecessarily high price .
cocktails - oh man - they have some amazing house cocktails - there was no way we could settle with just one .
it 's just a hollowed out pineapple and some light flavor on the rice that touched it .
the floor is n't the greatest , bathrooms ... let 's ignore those .
the bartender , chris , was very engaging and talkative .
it 's like a full sampling of all things fried !
the prices are reasonable for a casino and the service is good .
they have a great variety that range from hoppy to light and with their sampler options it is easy to find one that you love !
server was very attentive .
the wine steward was excellent and we did have two very good glasses of wine .
dry meat , basically all one temp . no seasoning , obviously uninspired workers as customer service was awful .
excited to go back and i love that downtown is becoming a food hub . keep up the great work !
definitely a higher price , but you get a high quality meal for the price .
the lighting is kind of poor , but that adds to the charm .
( the wine pairings were very good as well . )
i know it sounds crazy to say the fried onion rings were greasy , but there was a pool of grease at the bottom of the container .
pizza was pretty good . the wings were undercooked , and uneatable .
everything we had was delicious and full of flavor .
the prices are reasonable and the food is good .
the beef tepanyaki was ok but the rice definately was n't that great . it was too soft and almost mushy .
my boyfriend and i ordered bottles of mgd beer , which is a pretty common beer .
i did n't think the prices were particularly great , the store does n't look all that clean ( maybe it 's the lack of bright lighting ? )
your entire party must be there or they will not seat you .
i ordered the alfredo the dark pasta and it was horrible .
not sure if it was the muscle or the batter , but it was not pleasant .
the drinks were good .
if you are in gilbert you should try and support this small business , it has quickly become one of our family 's favorite !
the staff and owner here are super friendly .
the mojito is sweet and minty . very good .
this place is fantastic .
the portions are perfectly sized , and the prices are ridiculously low .
but the food was cold and congealed , the furniture was rickety , the dishes were dirty , and the service was mediocre .
service was fast and the restaurant staff is very friendly !
prices were reasonable as well .
the scampi is nasty and dry .
the salmon , while deliciously prepared , did have a few bones .
not sure what else to say .
i hate the fact that the menu is written all over the walls ( including wine ) difficult to read since it is very dim .
this place is awesome .
decent bar food , quick service , and reasonable price .
also , be careful when ordering your appetizers , they have huge portions .
the entire waiting staff there is full of attitude . and they fight amongst themselves loud in front of customers .
excellent . had the fish and chips but sub 'd house champ for fries .
you 'd like a margarita ? you 'd like a happy hour margarita ?
great prices ( $ 5.99 for a 2 item combo ) , and the food was nice and fresh .
it 's not that it was bad , it just had no flavour to it .
the expectation was n't high because it 's $ 0.99 , but it was still pretty bad .
he did n't seem to happy to be serving us . i tried to get him to smile , but this guy was stone cold .
the beer is cold and i have mixed drinks about feelings .
thought the name meant beer or good drinks . beers were pricey .
we had margaritas and beer , and the beer was the only thing with any alchohol content .
do n't get me wrong , it was over $ 60 for the two of us including tip , but it was pretty worth it .
at least the beer was decent .
we have a favorite spot closer to our house .
it took over an hour for everyone to finally get a warm meal that they ordered but then one of us took a bite into a plastic bread tab in their sandwich ... .
the prices are reasonable .
the rest of the crew loved their meals and the wine & beer .
they did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it 's not all about crappy beer .
a couple notes ... wednesday features a very talented lounge singer which is super fun .
the new restaurant is adorable .
although do find it really weird to see one of my hindu gods displayed in a venue filled with drunk scantily clad people .
for $ 4.99 , this is a very good deal .
i was shocked at the amount of food you get with the lunch special being that it was only $ 13 .
only disappointment was that everyone around us was given a ballon hat but us and we were there longer than everyone in the restaurant .
great place , family owned , great food , friendly staff .
hands down my favorite vietnamese in the downtown area !
the chicken bites were lukewarm by the time they got to me , but the sweet tots were decent ! boyfriend said you could n't really eat the chicken and waffle thing as a sandwich and also mentioned that the waffle seemed pretty soggy .
i really loved the salad , a great balance of dressing vs toppings and a very crisp , fresh taste .
the upholstery throws you back to bad decorating decisions of 1995. their decorator must 've thought floral seat covers and curtains would make a huge comeback ... .
stick to the beer ... the bartender did n't know how to make an manhattan and produced an overly strong , undrinkable concoction .
there were the normal beer options ( no craft ) and the wine was barefoot so nothing to write home about .
absolutely note that the portions here are crazy massive .
after that the pizza was terrible no tast at all . the pasta was ok at best .
- the space was amazing . very cool .
our total bill would be $ 12 and their food is excellent .
during lunch we waited for twenty minutes to be seated which speaks volumes to how people will wait for good and prices food .
they often have live music and the games are mostly free to play and there are numerous table top games and an xbox with several games on it and customers can bring their own games .
finally the bar keep noticed me sitting at a table without a beer and sent a girl over .
service was horrible , associates are rude .
i hate to be the guy who points out every problem , but this was ridiculous .
come here during sunset to make it a romantic date ; )
for a burger joint we love this place . the service is great .
did n't like food and terrible service , food took forever and was cold and dry looking when it finally arrived . view was great , too bad dining experience was n't up to its surroundings .
prices are reasonable . sound is excellent .
my aunt got the salt baked branzino and was also disappointed in her fish , she said it was bland .
pretty pricey at nearly $ 70 , which was not unexpected given the main restaurant 's reputation .
from my understanding , whenever you pay a tab the tax is always included in the total .
what a fabulous late lunch/early dinner on the way to the airport !
got takeout tonight which was amazing . i got the holy land mixed grill with 3 kinds of meat ( chicken , lamb and shawerma ) , 2 kinds of rice , hummus , baba ghanouj , and 2 pieces of pita bread for only $ 12.99 .
i think it is a little ridiculous what they charge extra for .
also , the organic margarita priced at $ 13 was ridiculous .
i love introducing new friends to the og killer shrimp .
i had a type of fizz , which the bartender made perfectly . the eggs were perfectly whipped , and the drink was exactly what i wanted .
i had a stout , ipa and a simple lager infused with a blueberry concentrate that were all very smooth and drinkable .
our waiter was extremely kind and very well knowledgeable on the menu .
the bad , which was not bad it was just ok , 4 separate appetizers and none with a wow by any means .
they both enjoyed both entrees .
$ 70 for a family of four is n't bad , but the appetizers simply do n't add on to the value .
good wine list and service .
i had a glass of wine which was wonderful and priced very well .
in their defense , the bottled beer was good .
there was also a good selection of wine list .
sat at the bar , ordered a cold negro modelo - they only offer it on draft .
the theme is quirky but kind of annoying .
i think their food is decent and the price is right .
not good , just cheap .
it 's the local bar that your comfortable in , the food is always great and the staff is always very friendly and efficient .
look was kind of drab .
another reason why i 'm a fan ... they are so nice here !
reasonably priced and good .
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
the staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean and well organized .
the fountains look great in the day , but even greater at night .
over $ 30.00 is ridiculous in my opinion .
they have couches and comfy chairs instead of normal chairs and i really liked how the restaurant was set up .
the lighting was bad , very dark inside which felt weird while having breakfast .
the toilets in the men 's bathroom were filled to the top with urine and would not flush .
went into this place on a weekday for lunch and had to wait 10 mins to be seated , although there was only 1 other couple in there , after we were seated , it took another 10 minutes for the server to get my drink order .
it cost about $ 9 and change in total , and it was just enough food .
anyway from the person who seated us , the man who brought and refilled water , and our server ; were all kind of grumpy and miserable .
we always take a big group and i hate paying $ 200 for bad food .
location was great , station square area , where there are many other restaurants , some shops and entertainment . location is near one of the three rivers .
they obliged but i felt like an imposition because it was apparent that i was being a pain . i did not feel welcome .
my husband was not at all impressed with his - too much bbq sauce made it soggy .
this place was super busy ... so in my opinion that 's always a good sign .
i 'm not sure how . maybe it slipped out the book and someone picked it up because we wait an additional 10 minutes and it was nowhere to be found .
i recommend sitting at the bar whenever possible -- they do have a patio .
either switch around the hot and cold food or label `` the line starts here '' .
the lobster grilled cheese is also good . and so is the lobster mac-n-cheese .
i ordered the tagliatelle . the sauce was bland , and there were not a lot of shrimp .
fries and onions rings were awful , over fried , we could n't even eat that .
this one is by far my favorite ( and i 've been to every location in the valley because i love this place ! )
the music and environment are wonderful .
wonderful service , full of smiles .
they have good prices for what they serve ( got 2 slices of pizza and bottled water for $ 15 ) .
my group all thoroughly enjoyed the whole meal and the entire staff was friendly and attentive .
the menu looked good , we thought the beer selection was good , especially having 12 draft beers .
seems weird to have a bartender that did n't know how to make the margaritas on the menu .
the ceiling was leaking water , ventilation was crap , floors in the room were stained and nasty , and it 's a damn maze just to find your room .
the previous attempts to come here for brunch had been futile due to excessive wait time .
fantastic first visit , of many more to come !
finding this place was an accident which i 'm glad we did .
unfortunately , it was basically gyro meat ... i would have liked to try something more out of the ordinary , but it was my own fault . i ordered it .
small nice place . i believe it 's family owned .
we were n't expecting the sparking wine , so that was a really nice surprise .
they only have four beers on tap , everything else was bottles .
but the wine was just awesome .
they offer a $ 19 , $ 25 n $ 32 meal . you ask for the $ 19 n they force you to buy the $ 25 meal even tho you do n't want the meats in the more expensive meal .
staff is attentive and friendly . very clean and inviting .
service was n't great and we felt like we were forgotten at some point .
we also tried ribs , brisket and coleslaw . everything was delicious .
kind of weird , and not really fitting .
drinks were a little weak but draft beers worked well enough .
enjoying the first nice weather of the year , we decided to take a walk to this place .
i love the ambiance .
very friendly and loves to talk to their customers !
the management should seriously consider retraining their serving staff !
beer selection through the roof . not a full bar though , just beer and wine .
however , no beer menu . weird .
i would give the food an alright rating , however the service was just so abysmal , i can not see how it can be worse than this .
the only real flaw it they should put padding on the ceiling or wall to suck up the loud noise from the plastered customers ..
no idea where they get their furniture or frames or clocks , but it 's like walking into a different era and i 'd eat there more often just for their decor and furniture .
the fries were nothing to write home about and there were some that were really crispy and perfect and other that were some what soggy so there was some inconsistency there .
the sushi was tasty and the service was great .
the food is reasonably priced for a quick but good meal .
great and reasonably priced restaurant .
great experience here - for food and for drinks .
paint peeling off the walls , chips and discoloration in the floor , counters messed up , but the food is great .
the chairs are kind of weird ... all metal , but that 's to go with the theme i suppose .
chicken wings are so juicy and tasty .
the bartender did n't know the beers they had on tap and seemed pretty out of it .
good quality . good prices .
unfortunately , they have no beers .
no margaritas . just beer and wine : -/ what 's a girl to do .
prices are cheap which is great .
6 people or more they include 15 % for tip , you can give more if you feel necessary .
- although they only had three beers on tap , at least they were good craft beer choices .
wife got a pork sandwich that was edible but looked awful .
we selected one of the tall tables near the bar and enjoyed a pitcher of sangria .
the cheeseburger sliders were raw on the inside and the bun was so hard , it was difficult to even bite into it .
the rest of the prices are pretty fair too though .
the poor service and food options are likely why this restaurant was pretty empty at lunch time . i will not be returning here .
and the cheese and sauce were nothing special .
i do n't drink beer , but my friends do and they said their beers were just ok , nothing spectacular .
not total hipster but it was just a weird setting .
there was also crazy rock music playing ( edc weekend ) .
the orange chicken was superb . and the beef pho was very tasty .
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
the amount was the perfect amount for drinks as we had 3 glasses each .
overall we got a huge dinner for under $ 50 with great service and yummy peach margaritas !
she is very rude and screws up our order every time .
when we arrived , we were extremely disappointed to find that the manager could n't seat us not only together , but on opposite sides of the restaurant to the point where we could n't even see each other .
i ordered the 5 handroll assortment and they were super small and flavorless .
the drinks were n't `` weak '' !
cheap prices . fast service .
but otherwise , cool cool .
probably one of of the least expensive places to dine in crystals ( which still will set you back $ 25- $ 30 a plate ) and it also has a nice view to people watch while you dine .
the employees are bored and ca n't be bothered to even fake a smile -- both at the point of ordering and the cashier .
it 's pretty comfy in there , plenty of couches and tables .
you have to pay extra for drinks , do n't ask for water cause its nasty .
the pancakes were all right , not nearly as good as i was expecting . the cheesecake filling was flavorless .
and priced great for amount of food .
the set up of the place is kinda awkward .
$ 250 for jack is a bit steep , even if they do throw in free soda .
the view is great and we enjoyed watching the monsoon hit the windows last night !
the guy at the front was super nice ( sorry , forgot the name ) and treated everyone like vip customers .
customers at the other tables appeared unhappy with the service .
the way the painful fluorescent lighting reflects off the bright yellow walls is almost genius in its awfulness .
beers were $ 1 at the bar which rules , and they had some sort of hefeweizen that tasted good to me .
was my first time to go there and the staff was very friendly and service was very quick !
now it 's all my family and friends favorite place also .
lovely breakfast and i will definitely be back - the only thing missing was music - it was crazy silent and the space is so beautiful - it was strange not to have soft music playing in such a lovely space .
everything was pretty disgusting . never again
i looked at their website in advance which has the menu as was very disappointed that the prices were vastly different and they told me that prices are subject to change .
i 'm glad we tried this place !
at 6 bucks a pop you ca n't beat that price especially in vegas !
the $ 70+ price tag for two people is ridiculous for the crap they are serving .
what meat they had was burned , dry and shriveled back from the bone into a dry black ball at the base .
pretty good food at an acceptable price .
by far one of our favorite local places to go . from friendly people to fantastic food , this place rocks !
very attentive waiter who did a great job .
drinks and service are both equally refreshing !
nothing bad to say about this place .
the prices are very reasonable , especially the sandwiches it 's perfect for lunch on a budget .
this concept would be fine for a moderate price sushi experience , but it 's a fail in a restaurant where you spend around $ 100 per person to have , i repeat , wonderful food ... just in the wrong setting .
their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers .
this is the worst place to spend $ $ $ for all you can eat buffet and the service is horrible .
unfortunately , no bud light lime on tap so we just drank regular beer .
quite pricey but i do n't mind paying more sometimes for really good quality food .
drinks , especially the sangria was yummy .
it helped take the chill out of me , since were were there on the coldest night of the year so far .
i highly recommend it !
well this place is super noisy .
they have alcoholic shakes too , great happy hour drink specials , ca n't beat it for being on the strip !
the food was totally cold and was obviously sitting out for a while ( there was a skin on the dipping sauce for our fries ) .
the decor was cozy but modern , and there was parking behind the restaurant , which is a plus when going to a restaurant on 17th avenue .
the rest however was just ok ... the pepperoni was super salty .
my girlfriend is a server , so i 'm very sympathetic to my servers and usually tip at least 25 % .
only thing `` nola '' was tacky beads on the lighting .
the menu has a little bit of everything - the apps we ordered were great ... i suggest the burrata and the charcuterie board is delicious .
some of us started out with the sangria which was delicious .
donna is the hostess with the mostest , and she keeps it fun and often funny .
the best part was that delivery was a dollar or two at the most . the dish was only 9 $ .
the price is very cheap too .
it was perfect ! we also go the lobster bisque which was great !
the best part of this resort is the pool area , its enormous and well-staffed .
we were able to get a table right by the window and the view was absolutely the best in cleveland . it was close to a full moon that night so there was a beautiful reflection over the lake with the city in the background .
they had a deal going where each large pizza 1-topping was only $ 5 if you did carry-out .
i had their pollo scaloppini and it was amazing . my girlfriend had the risotto de zucca , and it was also amazing .
give me a break man , i love football as well but i can differentiate when i 'm at work and when i 'm not .
we shared an assortment of great , fresh salads .
there were plenty if employees to be able to provide a good service , however that was not the case .
i do n't drink beer but the waitress said they had a good selection .
i 'm giving it a 4 star because i felt like the decor was a little cheesey ... the food is amazing ... it deserves matching surroundings .
the prices are very reasonable .
the price is not that high at all .
service was great and very friendly .
random but the bathroom was clean .
both full flavored and the fish was spiced very nicely ( requested medium-hot ) . the eggplant dish we ordered was also very tasty , with a bit of a chinese flavor to it , surprising and delicious .
showed up this sunday and there was a dj playing some easy techno beats that even my mother could enjoy . very pet friendly and our newborn enjoyed the sound levels as she slept through our late morning pick me up
i did not ask for any special tequila .
the drink selection was so lame .
service suffering so they an hire less people at minimum wage is not ideal .
i sat there for a good 5 mins and i did n't get a menu until i asked for it .
great wine selection by glass , half or full bottle . beautiful oysters .
the complimentary corn bread was a nice touch !
fresh rolls were too good to be true . yummy .
eventually , i got the free cocktail which was so strong i could barely drink it .
oh , and prices are on the high side for a vietnamese restaurant .
i was disappointed they did n't offer any beer on draft .
three stars for clean store , nice color scheme , neutral service , and clean but unexciting food .
the staff is amazing and very attentive . the place is clean .
not smiling looks angry and i had to ask her to place my plate in front of me coz it was across the table and my friend and i decided to seat beside each other .
i was n't drinking but looked like a good beer selection .
i do n't think $ 1.50 is a fair price tag for it .
the egg rolls were n't bad , but the fried won tons , the orange chicken , and the kung pao chicken were less than mediocre .
the sangria is phenomenal -- fruity and strong .
the food is ok , overpriced pub grub with mediocre portion sizes for $ 17 .
coffee was good , but be warned the drinks are expensive ... water cost four dollars . this place was far too expensive for what it is .
yay ! they also had banana , one of my other favorite yogurt flavors .
the families favorite restaurant since moving to henderson .
also , an excellent beer and wine selection to boot .
all of them were dry and bland .
she said it was good food .
with thirty some craft beers and wines on tap , beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender .
they were crispy and delicious .
so i tried to get a straight answer from the waitress ... .but she was trying to tell us each mother only gets half their meal for free , huh ?
i am thinking that being close to closing was the reason for the poor quality of food .
we ordered the signature frozen rose ' cocktails and they were super strong , but good .
also lori p. of guest relations , it would be lovely if you would stop apologizing and actually do something about my stay . i have seen you apologize on numerous other reviews and that is so fake .
the price was very reasonable .
is a little dry too cause they put in a heat box .
bring a bottle of wine or craft brew , a special someone or group of friends for an excellent time with good food and a lovely evening .
super delicious ! the hummus trio w/grilled chicken is amazing .
we had happy hour specials galore which included $ 5 wines by the glass . there was a malbec on happy hour which never happens and made me very happy .
they only have four beers on tap , everything else was bottles .
the ingredients are soo fresh and the hummus is off the chain ! a favorite ... .
they do have a full bar but no beer on tap .
the only disappointment was the twice cooked pork .
the prices are fair .
decent food , pretty cheap .
everything is decently priced .
food is excellent and the atmosphere is cool .
their portions are pretty big and the prices are n't too high .
not something with charred edges with nothing really spectacular 2 ) one of my group is allergic to eggs and the waiter confirmed his order would be fine but then left the sauce . someone else at the table noticed that it might have eggs and checked and the waiter confirmed it did and took it away without apologizing
the margaritas were so weak i 'm not sure they even had tequila .
as i remembered the pizza did n't look good , its just too saucy and not a good sauce either .
we enjoyed it so we ordered a second bottle - something was wrong with this bottle .
great staff , wonderful food , and lovely ambiance . would highly recommend .
my glass of wine went perfectly , all in all a great experience .
the decor is a little outdated but i forgive them .
i think there were only 3 or 4 beers offered , draft and bottled .
prices are very fair .
it was n't disgusting but it was n't good .
one of my all time favorite breakfast/brunch spots !
a totally satisfying meal with yummy boozy drinks made for a great night with friends .
fantastic , refreshing sangrias and they are only like $ 5 . bartenders super friendly and mixologist specials daily
it was absolutely disgusting .
the lunch menu options are very good and reasonably priced .
their wine list is excellent but i ca n't forget to mention their specialty cocktails either .
does this hotel always look dirty , run-down and dark ?
they 've got a good space with a patio suitable for post summer weather , and have n't had an issue finding parking here .
other visits to fleming 's have been fabulous .
clooney summer to drink was a perfect accompaniment ( berries and basil ) !
breakfast fan . huge portions and consistent delicious food .
the price was also very reasonable .
i then switched to beer - they have a pretty good beer list available , too .
this was like an imitation that reminds you of a real hot dog , if a real hot dog were a gross , tasteless and pathetic lump of turd .
high quality at an affordable price - does n't get any better than that !
the atmosphere was cozy and quiet to share a conversation on a date or a close friend .
great pizza , fresh ingredients and service was awesome !
i am confused as to why no one told me sooner .
but ours was the only table that was being served .
extremely small portion for $ 8 and was completely bland . i asked to return it politely and was treated very rudely .
i did not experience the bar , which i hear is very nice .
food was a little bland and plain looking but i 'm glad they had soy sauce and i was too hungry to care .
our server sean was super nice .
the drinks were fantastic ( manhattan straight up and the ginger ) and so was the food .
well , the wonton were tiny and bland , while it seemed like they put three noodles in the bowl with a huge amount of broth .
price is super affordable .
i think the part i most have a hard time with is that it 's a bar ... charging $ 15 for a pasta dinner !
service was great . cocktail was very well made and the beers were $ 5 special .
the restaurant itself is pretty neat and the storefront is fun to look through .
think of the effect of having headphones one ; only the person effected by the sound notices how loud it is .
food is boring , and bland .
it was n't the worst bbq i had ever had ( though that chicken was close ) .
our food was n't appetizing . the only meat that was mediocre was the chicken .
unfortunately , the food took what seemed like an eternity ( at least 30+ minutes ) before it was brought out .
they do have a nice size patio if you want to eat outside .
while we were eating , i heard one man who has a reservation was yelling loudly at the restaurant manager saying , you just randomly put our family into such awful dining location , but with such pricing dishes i have to pay .
when it came out , it was nothing but shredded imitating crab meats ( wtf ? )
i went for the dragon mint which was fragrant and not too strong ( the server lets you smell the tea before pouring ) .
very hip , great food , great drinks ( our waiter made me a special martini with infused serano peppers in it , fantastic ) . thanks nobu !
and did i mention that the margarita was very weak ? i think the bartender forgot the tequila .
very cheap though , you can have a feast for a group of 4 for about $ 50 .
their prices were really reasonable .
a burger is $ 10 but , unlimited fries and drink water ( you 're about to eat a lot of calories ) and two people can have a nice lunch for about $ 30 with a decent tip .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
reasonably priced food on the strip .
i 'll start with saying i love mexican food and to know that i have a place like this on my doorstep is reason enough to be happy !
we then got an update that it would n't be ready until 8:20 to 8:30. when we finally picked up the food , i have to say it was disappointing .
a glass of wine and some appetizers is a perfect way to start your trip . try their flute of wines .
it was all very good . the inside and bar is nice too even though it was a little cramped at the time .
i get the fact of the hipster décor and approach to almost anything that involves food nowadays , but old christmas decorations lining the walls it just ridiculous .
additionally , the food was lacked flavor and was not special .
i preferred the rolls without sauces , but i really did n't come across any that i disliked ... everything was pretty tasty .
first of all , i love the decor and i think this small space is really warm and charming .
the prices are extremely fair .
they have different sized lobsters , crab , snapper , sea bass , and many others .
upon entering the dining room we were amazed at how cozy and quaint it is and really nice that is was a separate room from the bar .
we also had margaritas which you could hardly taste anything but a pre-made margarita mix .
the restaurant itself looks nice , although the interior plywood siding gives it an `` unfinished '' feeling that i was n't very fond of .
finally another server saw me and promptly got my order , at least she was very nice .
we ordered drinks , which included an absinthe drip for 4. the absinthe drip was a huge hit , and it was easy to convince a few other friends to try a glass of the wonderful stuff .
the prices are decent with good portions .
they 're fresh juicy chicken pieces and the batter is so light and crispy .
margaritas were n't strong at all , they tasted like there was no alcohol in them .
i love coming here even though i live all the way from the south !
it 's beautiful and comfortable , just not very tasty .
i thought the interior was a little bland and the industrial chairs did n't fit the look to me .
also , the `` dirty curtains '' people talk about on here is a real thing .
there are some good deals like the quiche and salad which is about $ 9 . and their homemade pasta salad ( like the tuna salad ) is soo amazingly good .
the server was pleasant and very attentive .
the owner is super friendly .
i thought that was a little weird , tasted as they usually do , again average . had jambalaya it was tasty but nothing to write home about .
just tofu that was not soft , crispy , flavorful , just chewy and bland .
as my party began to arrive , we asked how we could move tables together . we were told by our waitress , and by a manager named derek , that there was a party getting ready to leave behind an already empty table , and we could just then grab that one , and move the two together .
again , everyone was happy .
we had the tasting menu and it worth every penny . every dish was no , everything on the plate was perfectly season and combine .
they have an excellent selection , and a very good wine list .
my room had a weird stain on the carpet , dirt and a hair in the tub , lipstick or nail polish ( could n't tell which one ) on the bathroom counter , and one of the bathroom lights was askew .
it looks nice , but the set up was quite awkward .
i ordered a mescal cocktail which was delicious .
very quick service and solid quality for a fairly inexpensive price .
the bathroom was beautiful and spotless but i 'll just say this : i hate bathroom attendants . that is all .
this is what i imagine the food is like in an upscale retirement home . the place is beautiful inside .
décor still looks great and the place is clean which is a definite bonus .
waitress was nice , food was good but it should n't take 5 min to get a soda .
the aesthetics here are somewhat hard to describe , though the numerous yelp photos of the interior pretty much paint an accurate picture .
a great place for a weekday work lunch . cheap prices , fast service , and quite reasonable portions .
walking in , it gives a very pleasant vibe .
the margarita was perfect and one was enough .
this place was top notch , it was super clean and the staff was friendly .
the ambience was just outright creepy .
there 's no hard liquor , just beer and wine .
the draft list was n't bad but nothing out of the norm .
only had a few drinks and an appetizer .
it was cold and the noodles were hard .
food was presented poorly and did not taste good . terrible
awesome place to go chill and hang out .
it was n't that they did n't know we were coming . and when we complained about it all they said was `` happy thanksgiving . ''
not many beers on tap , but what they had were pretty good .
food was delicious ! the white chocolate bread pudding was amazing !
they have a great atmosphere & the wait staff have been really friendly and prompt each time i 've been in there .
cocktails are over the top and music is super cool . great vibe all around .
it was in a cute little area of town .
after leaving a dark restaurant do not walk into their bright blinding bathroom .
great place to have events with a spacious stage and dance floor .
i 'm in love with the interior of this place and they also offer outdoor seating .
watch out for a $ 2 split per item - this is not necessary considering the price on each dish .
the stone crab was probably previously frozen and tasted pretty bad .
i love the spicy calamari and the vegetables compliment it very well . the chicken egg flower soup was perfect and the orange chicken and mongolian chicken was very tender .
the total came to $ 13 , not too shabby considering the portions .
i drank the tasteless overpriced drink and switched to beer .
to top it off no draft beer in the theater only the bar ?
only bottled beer , nothing on tap was a bit of a downer .
the sweet , syrup soaked amazingness was just what the doctor ordered .
the bathroom walls sadly need a fresh coat of bright paint - the restaurant decor is fine but when you walk into the women 's washroom , you feel like you 've entered into some other grimy business .
easy to grab on the way to work because they are open at 7am during the week .
the price is quite reasonable as well .
i would definitely recommend this restaurant for any one who wants to go out on a nice date .
the beer was decent and drinkable .
their drinks are also delicious -- they have a variety of soju , beer , and wine for you to enjoy .
i asked for a blended margarita and was told they only do on the rocks . what kind of bar does n't have a blender ?
it was sloppy inside ( almost felt like it was n't cooked thoroughly ) , and the seasoning they used was kinda wired .
love the chill vibe of this place . great place to grab a drink and chat , but i ca n't rave about the food .
ingredients were very true to the chicago style pizza .
wow . incredible gyro .
hallway leading to washrooms have some quirky notes , read them for laugh .
and it is reasonably priced at $ .85 .
the sweetest deal was the mimosa bottle special .
the waiter made a really good wine recommendation .
i was slightly disappointed that they did n't have wine only beer .
great breakfast with good specials , very reasonably priced especially for the strip , entrees are $ 13.95 for most . service was excellent and fast .
very bland food , basically a take out place . they have beers listed on the menu board but they were out of drafts , out of modelo , and the corona was n't cold !
the meats that were offered for lunch , such as the steak and ribs , etc , were absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly .
the food is very fresh and the spicy hummus is just right .
the sushi was good and since it was a friend 's bday , they gave us huge bowls of this citrus mint alcohol beverage . super good !
great job and it 's nice to have live music in phoenix , especially in a venue like this .
we got a table very quickly but the hostess did n't even say hi .
the bar is cool , have stopped here in the past and enjoyed the atmosphere of the bar .
tried their sweet bbq and it was decent . the breading quickly got soggy and the sauce was kind of sparse .
craft beers were about 5-6 which is n't too bad .
the prices were , ridiculous .
three of them got steak and loved it but i got salmon and it was awful ! super dry and over cooked .
it has a great view after long night in casino you can relax and enjoy the great view , food , and service .
not really ideal for seating .
prices are not crazy either .
not worth $ 80 for two with one glass of $ 11 rose .
owners are usually there working and are very pleasant .
sort of charming inside but comfortable .
another friend we were with ordered the warm asparagus salad and for $ 14 you literally get like 5 pieces of asparagus with sauce drizzled on it ... .more like a side rather than a salad .
2. the menu , way too cluttered , font too small , very hard to read compounded by the poor lighting .
ham was dry i had to drown it in ketchup . they gave us the wrong bill , orange juice tasted funny ,
reasonable prices , good service , but plain atmosphere .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
the prices are very reasonable .
it 's been many years since i 've been to this particular location and it was great to be able to return to the original . it 's been more than 25 years since i found this gem and have been thrilled to watch this family business grow with multiple locations and not lose the charm and wonderful food that caused me to return all those years ago .
i realize we did n't have a reservation but every table except one was empty the entire time we were there .
they serve great cocktails and some food .
like another reviewer said , they could cut the portion size and charge about $ 2 less , my lunch was about $ 12 without a drink , which is kind of expensive for lunch and i could not finish .
it was over $ 100 for two of us , it is cheaper when it 's not the holidays but it is really good food .
we had a wonderful waitress who recommended the carafe of speciality drinks .
fair warning the portions are huge .
all the curtains were down too which made it unnecessarily dark . mediocre .
staff was courteous and efficient .
good selection of drinks and beer on tap but i was dissapointed they did n't have a drink menu so we had no idea what anything cost .
wtf are you kidding no one cares about the 30 cents but how rude is that .
the atmosphere is perfect for a nice dinner , celebrating an anniversary or having dinner with the family ; someone is usually playing the piano too !
the lighting was a little dim so it was hard to read the menu .
it was replaced with another draft beer that was n't that great either .
being from san francisco there is no need to spend $ 19 on a chicken dish , when you know you can get it at home for $ 10 .
their have a very pleasant wait staff .
amazing scallops in an intimate setting . worth every penny , but i disagree with the `` $ $ '' rating , it should likely be $ $ $ - $ $ $ $ .
steak was chewy ( and done , not medium rare like ordered ) and chicken was rubbery .
ugh , so uncomfortable and an odd design with just 1 arm .
only when we were there last sunday and saw the cashier did i recognized the person who sent the friend request .
i enjoyed the hot sauce alot .
fairly priced and good value .
we had a delicious bottle of wine .
i was n't impressed nothing special .
the lunch special prices are great especially when you 're on a budget .
it was not a bad call .
the only thing that bothered me most about the food was how quickly it came out .
lucky to have this so close to work .
the drinks are cheap .
great food with a relaxed atmosphere .
the place is set up rather awkward .
we stopped by for the munch happy hour , which features a discounted drinks and appetizers .
: - ) i actually do n't remember what i ordered - i thought it was a glazed chicken dish that was mild in taste ( not spicy ) .
i do n't think it would 've tasted as good had we not ordered it with ramen .
i would highly recommend coming here .
the egg was n't cooked like a traditional ramen egg , it was runny , which also contributes to the watered down flavours .
in the restaurant 's defense the waitress was extremely apologetic and offered to bring him a new plate , but he declined . i did n't mention my toothpick to her , since otherwise the food was delish .
happy hour rocks as well with great deals on food and beer .
i just wish the place was more acoustically kind to not have conversations etc bouncing off the walls and ceiling .
margarita tasted good , but was a little weak , i stuck to beer after having one .
all you had to do was offer me a more respectable piece of fish worthy of a $ 32 price tag .
the room was mediocre at best . the floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded .
everyone loved their meal and the drinkers enjoyed the myriad of beers .
cheese crisp was ok , rice was decent , and the tacos were alright .
the employee seemed annoyed to serve us .
it could have easily cost $ 20 anywhere else .
great food and affordable prices .
drink menu consists of many different kind of martini , and they serve in a cocktail shaker to keep your drink chilled until your last drop .
they type of thing one used to expect at fine dining an experience you 'd never had before but except fine dining does n't seem to do that anymore ; planta takes your taste buds on holidays to somewhere far flung , exotic where you do n't knowing what to expect around the next corner .
they are not cheap , but their prices are reasonable .
the food was just okay . the chicken in my salad almost tasted like pressed chicken you 'd find in a fast food sandwich ( i 'm guessing it was n't , but the flavor was n't much better ) .
as for the prices , it was very cheap . it was good food for the value .
the chicken had a nice consistency but could have used more seasoning .
the sushi was dry and had absolutely no flavor at all .
my wife had an apple martini that she thought was too strong ... but she is n't much of a drinker so i tried it and it was definitely too strong .
we did n't try the food but they poured the drinks a little light .
the prices were reasonable .
the atmosphere here is loud and pretty busy .
prices are very reasonable .
the only thing i steered clear of during our second visit was the orange vanilla lemonade -- too sweet .
both were delicious af . had my first sazerac drink ( $ 6 on happy hour ) and it was amazing .
disappointed , and should probably let the customer know this before ordering .
amazing , charming , quirky tea house in the center of plateau montreal .
the vegan ranch was $ 1.99 and not good at all i dont mind paying $ 5 or $ 10 but for something good and tasty .
the only thing that saved it was the decor inside .
my husband got a meat variety plate that had a nice variety choices .
unfortunately , no bud light lime on tap so we just drank regular beer .
i walked in 10 min before closing i hate doing that , i asked what time do they close and the older guy in the register answered we are still open .
this one is by far the best one i have been to and i think it will be around for a long time .
but the staff was really nice explaining how everything worked .
its like $ 7 and very good . very friendly atmosphere .
so excited to see one of our favorite restaurants here in fort mill .
menu is very small & prices are cheap .
the prices are reasonable as well .
every item we ordered had a nasty smell and taste .
the lighting is kind of poor , but that adds to the charm .
good ambience and decent prices .
there 's animal heads on the wall but it does n't feel creepy .
service is great . their fried chicken sauce and kimchi fries are amazing .
the last names was peeling off on the wall , even with tapes and pins on , it 's obvious and looking ugly on my photos .
it would be nice if they could get rid of the tags in the men 's room , the graffiti is just kind of ugly and detracts from the rest of the place .
the pork was a tad dry , but not too bad .
this dark seductive restaurant was filled with other delicious drinks ( chocolate martinis ) though i definitely recommend the cucumber martini .
sadly i did n't get a beer .
pho is below mediocre and the manager is rude and crooked .
when i say drinks i mean sodas - no special bar drink or something .
decided to try out the kiosk & i can say i love this new tech !
it 's not only bring your own wine ( and beer ) , but it 's pretty hard to get out of there spending more than 15 bucks per person with tax and tip ( including appetizers , main course , nan , etc ) .
it looks nice , but the set up was quite awkward .
the décor is beautiful ( even the bathrooms ) .
our server was very professional and attentive .
the hispanic flared location has an open kitchen area with great artwork accents .
great steak . ask to sit on the patio so you can watch the fountains during dinner .
i think the mixed greens was a little overdressed and the chicken noodle was very bland . the french toast was also not that great -- really chewy .
decently priced and good service .
the decor , probably lol
everything was cooked fresh , and presented perfectly , and ridiculously quick .
while i 've always kind of enjoyed mimi 's this particular location has disappointed for the last time .
very nice interior and a bit loud .
at $ 15 for their lunch menu and $ 20 for their dinner menu the price is pretty average for las vegas .
the interior was nice but felt like a knock off , with paint chipped off some of the styrofoam ball ornaments .
i tried a little bit of both and the fried shrimp were nothing special tasted like frozen shrimp .
patio is different . although all the stone and cement furniture outside look real nice , your ass will be numb if sitting for more than 30 minutes .
i thin the cook makes everything here from stretch .
i was n't expecting authentic thai food but this was unacceptable goo .
the lighting is horrible ; could not read the menu .
sad to say it will be a while before we go there again .
the restaurant itself is very clean and very modern . the decor is great !
i miss not having an awkward swivel table , blocking the drink holder , with an obnoxious led light .
very fair for a high end restaurant at $ 350 for the bottle .
they have a nice selection of wines by the glass , though they are all $ 12 or above , and our server was very good and very attentive .
when i kindly told our server that the fries were over done she rolled her eyes and gave me a lot of attitude .
worst calamari ever , though the sauces it came with were good .
it 's only a four star because they could use a little work in the customer service / friendliness department .
server not friendly , but i will prob be kind of rude too .
polite and fast service . restrooms were open and clean .
the inside is clean .
total bill for 2 drinks and 2 appetizers was almost $ 50 , which is too high for dormont bordering mt .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
the food variety was amazing , and i tried a little of everything .
this is a great little cafe .
great food for about $ 12- $ 15 for dinner and $ 8 or so for lunch .
where it looks kinda sketchy but the food is good lol .
long wait , poor service , cold food , bad food ... need i say more ?
i 'll freely admit i got lured in by all the skulls and stuff on the walls .
it 's especially nice during a storm or sunset .
chicken was slightly overcooked , but i 'd rather have over cooked than under cooked .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
weak drinks , there i said it .
the dessert was pretty good , but i 'd definitely come back for the sea bass .
horrible horrible service and food . the owner is very condescending and rude .
sangria was also great .
the service was really good even for sitting out on the patio .
i started off with their signature margarita , it was fantastic .
decor is weird , though .
the servers were all really nice , patient , and efficient .
there are loads of delicious wine flights and yummy wines by the glass .
in fact , they gave us the option to tip more , so be careful when you tip !
ridiculous to pay $ 40+ for four hot dogs and soft drinks ( no alcohol included ) .
i hate the fact that the menu is written all over the walls ( including wine ) difficult to read since it is very dim .
the only negative i can offer ( which was difficult , 'cause almost everything else was perfect ) was the fluorescent lighting - no one wants to be reminded of `` work '' when they 're trying to unwind with a nice meal - and the lighting reminded me of that .
the one bright point ?
the menu looked good , we thought the beer selection was good , especially having 12 draft beers .
also had the chicken stroganoff that was tasty with homemade noodles .
the pizza is really cheap , too . good value .
everything was amazing and the staff was super friendly .
the food portion is decent especially for the low price !
they had no problem lying in stead of being honest and saying there 's a long wait , to give us , the customers , the chances to decide if we want to be held hostage for 30 minutes or go elsewhere .
beer was cold but all the mixed drinks had almost no alcohol .
they only had 5 beers on tap , which i thought was sort of odd .
i had the new york steak and crab . it was perfectly cooked and one of the best tasting steaks i 've had in a while .
service was friendly . wait staff seemed to be confused at first but our waiter informed us that it was the staff party night so most of the staff was pulled in from other locations - considering that they still did pretty well .
i get they are trying to be `` different '' but seriously i think the 2 menus just complicate things .
only four beers on tap , none of which were particularly good .
that nasty smokers scent is ingrained into every piece of furniture , walls , rug , etc .
even the margarita was bad .
the waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were .
the meat was mealy and just fell apart ... not cool .
the interior is completely redone and it is bright and cheery . the food is excellent !
beer selection was ok , food was ok , service was ok ( one of the draft beers the server was unsure of , i think there were only 4 on the list .
not a huge fan of frosty glasses for craft beer , but it was n't so bad that there was an iceberg floating in my beer or anything .
cute interiors and atmosphere . the place is dimly lit , which makes for nice ambience .
the beer garden is nice in the summer but it really suffers from a crap view and they tend to be short on staff . mezzo has good food , but the atmosphere is just not as fun .
both the triple delight and the spicy basil chicken had broccoli and i liked how crunchy it was as well as the bite size pieces.. service was attentive and he offered suggestions .
i found rosati 's pizza delicious and it surely satisfied my craving for deep dish pizza .
great food and they have a special pisco drink this month
both are unique and delish pastas .
i did n't order any beer or cocktails , but looked like a great selection of beer .
really good for pretty cheap !
food is good and price is reasonable .
i got the chicken curry and the meat is very tender .
beer and wine yes , hard booze no .
i was a little sticker shocked at the final bill partly because they do n't list the prices well for the kids menu and partly because the items are a little pricey but it is well worth it and still cheaper than most places on the strip .
the prices are very reasonable .
with thirty some craft beers and wines on tap , beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender .
great burgers and sandwiches . small outdoor patio for warm nights .
lol except sweet :3 i 'm a fan of blood orange drinks , be it alcohol or non-alcoholic ( san pellegrino ) .
i did n't order a drink because they only had cuervo as far as tequila at the outside bar . the food was ok not great but just fine .
surprisingly , certain bibimbap bowls came with an egg but the one i ordered ( chicken ) did not .
so kind and welcoming .
the dim lighting and live band feature created a swanky and classy vibe to the restaurant which i loved .
everything is great about this place except the cost ... average $ 22.00 for a large pizza or a 12 '' gluten free pizza .
it 's very distracting and weird .
expensive food and drinks with ok quality .
the service is either great or you get the weird one who probably should n't be around people .
tastes are good with reasonable prices .
i love the drinks here , strong !
great spot for a place like vegas though !
only complain i have is that the lighting is really weird .
called the manager and his response was `` sorry about that '' . i expect exceptional service out of an upscale establishment like this and i did n't think that response was sincere .
between the cool patio and the trendy lounge , it 's a great spot to relax with friends .
that was dirty and the bathrooms were scary dark .
their mimosas are very unique because they use a sorbet with prosecco .
not sure if it 's the proper technique or not , but i stirred it all together and enjoyed it quite a bit .
it 's a great place and the staff are always pleasant .
our cocktails were also right on - tried the manhattan martini and the bellini .
the oysters , escargot and sea bass were cooked perfectly . the escargot had a great texture and the sauce went well with the baguette .
3 ) prices are very reasonable .
service is excellent provided by very friendly servers . our favorite italian restaurant .
seating is plentiful and we were lucky enough to get a booth .
delicious with a reasonable price .
service was attentive but not overbearing .
really delicious , atmosphere was very quaint
the food was excellent but the service was so rushed and the floor host hovered so much that it made it an unpleasant dinner . too bad because it had the potential to be a great meal .
then we shared the garlic chicken stir-fry .
however , the price is a bit high for the food .
this was such a cool little spot ! the setting is casual and has a fun vibe .
for $ 8 and being right on property , its great .
the decor seems to be somewhat childish .
their drinks are awesome .
originally found this place through yelp , and decided to try it out while on a visit to the area .
the sangria was served with a orange ( of course ) and was blended perfectly with fruity and wine .
the pastor in the taco had good flavor for sure but it was n't that meaty and was mushy in texture , one taco was 3 bucks and it was a little skimpy too , nothing memorable and except for the pork it had that same `` generic '' flavor as the burrito .
its a great place to chill with a group of friends , lounge around on the sofas and listen to the live music .
when you pay $ 52 for an 8oz filet it should be close to perfect .
cool concept but for the price you pay , i prefer going to a steakhouse .
i know it 's only $ 20 per person for the dinner .
service was amazing . so friendly .
the chicken was so over cooked it was tough to eat .
had a great night ! took my daughter out for a daddy daughter date and had a great time !
loved saigon kitchen ... clean , friendly efficient staff , and amazing foood !
margarita tasted good , but was a little weak , i stuck to beer after having one .
my slight would be a somewhat awkward dancing area surrounded by tables in every direction .
the sangria was delicious but not very strong .
however , i wanted to give the bartender a talking to ... he was rude , i asked for a food menu while we waited and he responded `` i do n't have one , i 'll have to go over and get one , we do n't serve food at the bar '' , in a super condescending tone .
the only issue is one of the waitresses , her attitude is awful !
bad idea ! margaritas were ok but not booze in them !
each dish came with a side and i had their twice baked potato which was equally excellent .
good prices . good service .
pretty good wine selection i guess , i 'm not a wine guy . not much of a beer selection for being a beer and wine bar .
they had some great drinks on draft that tasted like beer .
the tempura jalepeño appetizer was our favorite . the las vegas and tuna lover rolls were both delicious , and service was quick and efficient .
had our friends birthday dinner here the other night and it was great .
i 'm sorry , this place was disappointing just as their exterior restaurant design shows they do n't put much care or effort to running their business .
the wait staff was super friendly and accommodating .
odd experience ... and not that cool quirky kind of odd ...
the person was n't annoying just the theme park feel of that .
so glad we did !
it 's a relaxed atmosphere with a casual crowd .
( however , it 's probably no more nasty than the rest of circus circus which you are forced to walk through to get to this place ) .
way too expensive ( $ 13.99 ) for a forgettable meal .
i had called the night before to request a refrigerator for my room and was told its a $ 25 upcharge ( which is crazy but i was willing to pay for it due to dietary restrictions ) .
she had a taco salad that was tasteless .
nice touch is everybody gets their own dish of ginger to mix with vinegar .
the entrance is kinda creepy , but whatever haha .
they only had a few beers on tap , and none that were particularly exciting .
my dad had the bacon plate with baked beans and loved the meat & side . my sister had the mac and cheese side and hush puppies and loved her food too .
the price is cheap but so are some other places in the area .
although do find it really weird to see one of my hindu gods displayed in a venue filled with drunk scantily clad people .
i also had a mexican bottle coke which is always refreshing and good .
it might just be the placement of the furniture , but there 's something that kind of feels ... awkward .
it really was n't that bright ( bright finish , but immediate taste was dark ) .
the space looks a bit like a speakeasy and has wine barrel covers and casual seating for lounging and drinking .
stopped by for lunch today to pick up food for my boyfriend only to be welcomed by employees who looked as though they were annoyed to be taking my order . they were young and i understand that , but even the manager was unprofessional and rude .
very nice center bar and great outdoor seating with neat lighting & games which i can imagine is very popular in the cooler months & night time .
i would not consider this a romantic place but great to relax and catch up with friends or eat by yourself .
i am so very happy that we found this place !
about $ 35 for dinner , but this is cheap as hell for a 5 star dinner .
the waitress , who is clearly new , was very nice and very apologetic about the bad service .
the ambiance of the restaurant is exciting - sits on the corner of lv blvd - great for people watching .
the house infused cocktail was delicious however .
got sesame chicken large . taste was alright , but there was whole lot of bread and very little chicken .
my favorite plate is the gyro deluxe with pita and hummus . can not go wrong with haji-baba !
the `` og '' margarita was n't bad in flavor , but did n't have any indication that any tequila was in it .
people , beware of the rude manager should any issue arise with your food .
we spent a little over $ 100 for just the 2 of us and only alcohol was 1 beer a piece .
my sandwich was filing but tasteless .
the food tastes good and is reasonably priced for vegas . the quantity deserves a special mention too .
however , the beer was good . they poured a good beer .
the wine was awesome .
the prices are fairly reasonable .
only four beers on tap , none of which were particularly good .
my only complaint was that their `` mystery beer '' , which appears in the draft beer pages , was a bottle of an octoberfest beer .
our waitress was n't overly friendly or pleasant , but she did the job just fine .
this place is really good to just chill and drink .
the decor is so bad it 's bad ; a nightmare of plastic plants covering every available surface lit by dim but still remarkably gaudy neon .
the drinks were good .
when i asked for a menu , the bartender was rude , and had to wait 30+ minutes to order .
salad bar and drinks were boss but the appetizers were awful . i liked the peach martini .
good food , especially the potatoes .
we also enjoyed the well selected wine list .
it came with marinara sauce on top which i liked but just tasted like mozzarella sticks .
i have lived one block from this place for 7 years and never knew it was there so what i 'm saying is you could easily miss it driving by .
however , my `` breakfast '' total price came to 54 dollars and that 's without a tip .
the prices were reasonable .
it was hot and sweet and salty and tasty and just delicious .
great food and drinks on happy hour .
they serve dinner with hot tea we also ordered beer and a bottle of sake .
stick to the beer ... the bartender did n't know how to make an manhattan and produced an overly strong , undrinkable concoction .
their nacho stix are expensive pieces of dry cardboard with cheese and jalapenos , nasty . do n't bother with those .
in this case , it just did n't work because it was just as bland as the rest of the taco and made a huge mess .
the high quality food and service earns it four stars but if you can do without the decor and stylish casino vibe denny 's just down the street can save you $ 18 bucks .
the tables , chairs , and walls were kind of dinged up and worn looking .
too expensive for mediocre food .
the waitress said we do n't have any gluten free menus , they `` were never printed . ''
they have an $ 8 lunch special ... to those complaining about how expensive their dinners were , go somewhere with a dollar menu .
the store is decorated very minimally with a modern farmhouse vibe .
even the tea was bland .
prices are reasonable too .
when drunk , finding the bathroom at remedy 's is like a mini maze .
food was delicious and server was attentive .
the draft beer selection was lacking but the bottle service was awesome .
pricewise , you get a good amount of food for five dollars per taco .
prices are reasonable for the quality .
they have good prices . wine is good .
the wine selection was great .
attractive , i know .
my only gripe is the hefty price tag .
was drinking bottle beer so hard to not get that right .
awesome buttered and garlic naan , grilled shrimp , chicken tikka masala and delicious desserts and chutneys .
the pasta shop has a great ambience and a warm and pleasant environment .
these plastic bowls are not meant to serve hot food , like the soup i was served because it came with my meal .
the beer selection was n't bad .
creates a nice and enjoyable atmosphere , everyone was happy to be there !
i ordered the eggrolls it was good . second i ordered number one it was great also ... the only thing i didnt like is the sewer smell ...
my big problem was the ambience ... dusty dried flowers and picture frames ... filthy carpet , and do not use the restroom .
the iced tea was delicious .
it really was n't that bright ( bright finish , but immediate taste was dark ) .
choice of beers was n't to bad .
bathrooms and the dining area were clean , and the acoustics were charming - not too loud , not too quiet .
the food is expensive , but not for the quality .
the bottled beer was nice and cold but my friend thought the tap beer was not nearly cold enough .
what a cool place !
the drinks are delicious and strong .
great prices and value .
good food . all the beers are like 4 bucks each , but other than that everything is reasonably priced .
do n't bother with dollar margarita tuesdays . they 're so syrupy it 's impossible to drink an entire glass .
the selection of draft beers looked o.k . nothing outstanding but their bottle selection sucked .
we did have to wait 20 minutes even with a reservation , which was frustrating , but it may have been that they were trying to honor our patio request .
the tempura was really soggy , which was unpleasant .
however , the poor service overshadowed the good food and ruined our experience .
large , super delicious sandwiches with homemade potato chips .
fair prices , too .
the special tables for the $ 200 minimum are so romantic .
he was fast , friendly , accomodating , and made great suggestions . thanks for making our family dinner a great experience !
they unfortunately were out of canolli batter .
generally they were pretty good but not great , i thought there was too much bread .
no alcohol this trip , but they do have a full bar , with 5 beers in tap .
it did n't taste anything like cheesecake and was really disappointing .
$ 7.95 is a very fair price .
but good spot for some cheap food .
they did n't have any beer on tap , only select few bottles which was disappointing .
i also love that they bring you a pitcher of iced water and a carafe of coffee .
the dining area is quite comfortable looking and has some outdoor space too .
yelp check-in : free topping if you 're ever craving boba in vegas , i recommend giving this place a try !
anyway , the chairs are stupid , and uncomfortable anyway .
their problem , in my opinion , is the very loud live music .
bad part is i was the only one in drive thru and had to wait 20 minutes for service .
the staff was very friendly and answered all our questions .
they had a nice wine selection and the riesling was delish .
they do have alcohol but sadly , no full bar .
i ordered another drink as the beer flight was hardly anything .
the whole place was really dirty - stains on the walls and the floors were disgusting .
the other dishes were pretty good but in general most items were overly sauced .
another bummer was that they only service wine and beer , but lacked a strong list of either .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
map room is a prime example of my kind of bar .
the only thing i was n't into was the decor , i can see the charm in it but it felt dusty and old without charm .
a+ for fast and friendly service .
the pricing is justified by the portions .
we enjoyed a nice glass of wine and were not rushed at all .
the lamb neck was super simply amazing ! the sides of fried oysters and potato squares were the perfect compliment .
it was a weird combo with the pineapple bun because the sweetness overpowered everything else .
once you enter and make a right , there 's a larger , bright space with more tables and a view of that side of the strip .
ended up leaving because of the rude hostess and rude waiter .
the bill was around $ 50 which is n't too bad .
she was unclear with her instructions and where to wait in line for the server to sit you . the another employee came over and was rude in telling us where the line was to wait for the server to seat us .
rosa was super nice and the service and smiles were there !
of course , they also have a full bar and wine .
if only it were closer to work !
while they have a good menu of sake and spirits , i did not drink tonight .
for eating on the strip , it 's reasonably priced .
the draft beer selection was lacking but the bottle service was awesome .
they have a full bar with decent selection of beers on tap , by the bottle and wine .
their homemade muffins are everyone 's favorite , you ca n't go to mars without tasting their amazing muffins .
the salads are awesome with extremely fresh ingredients and the perfect amount of dressing .
their beer selection is decent and the prices are pretty good .
it 's not expensive .
one of the bathrooms didnt have mirrors which i dont like but were clean .
love the unique selection of tacos .
2 drinks and a flatbread pizza cost me $ 38 dollars which is just crazy .
both good for the price - it 's inexpensive .
the manager even came by to ensure all was good .
i just had a very nice lunch here today . i was looking for place to eat steak and open for lunch on yelp and this one came up .
we came in there for lunch , it was not even that busy , but we had to wait for good 10 minutes in the hall before anyone was able to help us .
i recommend the volcano roll and the cod wrapped with butter lettuce . the tempura rolls are also very good .
we did the 5 course menu for $ 56 , which is a great price for all that 's included .
looking forward to return visits ( and likely my husband will join me now too . )
the staff is super friendly and deliveries groceries right to my vehicle .
i recommend the fish , mac and cheese and sweet potatoes and every thing else !
all of us ate for $ 97 ( 7 people total ) so that is n't too shabby either !
rolls tasted like the rice was cooked a while ago . many rolls lacked any flavor , and the gyoza appetizer was mediocre at best .
great pizza but at a premium this place has some of the best sauce and crust in town .
good food , tapas style .
the only knock is that there was no beer on tap ; bottle selection was good though .
i think a more fair price would have been about four dollars considering the size of the cupcakes .
the bathroom was kind of dirty and there were n't any paper towels .
we have a habit of being underdressed but never have they treated us with anything less than excellent service .
the waiter was courteous and efficient . the restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was clean .
bree at the bar was awesome ! try the pomegranate martini !
but the bartenders were pretty poor at mixing a good margarita .
there is an enclosed smoking section ( a + ) and a really large , comfortable area with built in trash cans for your paper .
i love vegas for this reason and this bar is a nice little place to go where everyone will at some point know your name and then buy you shots of jameson in appreciation : - ) a nice place to drop the bf off as i get my lashes done and its a win-win for both !
kind of comes off tacky .
only negative thing i 'll say is the bathroom area was dirty ! the hallway to the bathroom was pretty gross .
the prices are a little high , but you get what you pay for .
price point is on the high side but what can you expect from a restaurant at the encore .
my daughter had the chicken and broccoli , which she did n't like but i did .
it was ok and the reasonably priced .
the layout and decor was nice and minimalistic , and not crowded .
very good ... low prices .
the bartender was miserable and disappeared for most of the time .
after rolling by a ton of places lit up with fancy signs and neon lights , pulled up to this restaurant not expecting much . how wrong was i .
i 've never had a $ 100 a person awkward dinner .
the room is beautiful and calming .
this place was outstanding !
my first time here and the food was was wonderful .
we shared a caesar salad , chicken fingers , and a pretzel .
not sure how the food was ( 2 hours and no food ever came .. had to leave to make it to a show ) . service tried , but no point if food never shows up .
price is a little high for the size of the serving but the taste pays off i suppose .
ordered the house margarita on the rocks , which was also delicious .
i thought the cocktails were priced good for happy hour .
we ordered the beef/lamb and it was flavourful and hot .
the energy , lighting and cleanliness was awful .
the prices are great for what you get too .
drinks : fountain drinks are strong and good .
not bad for $ 12 .
beer and margaritas available , not sure about any other alcohol .
no more expensive than anywhere else and even cheaper than most .
my friend had the steak fajitas ; tasted ok but just luke warm .
good food and reasonable prices .
the daily hot food section is also great .
did i mention the great fresh garlic ?
my wife had the szechuan salmon , which she was also very pleased with .
the room was mediocre at best . the floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded .
the beer selection was pretty poor so i ended up with a whiskey cocktail instead .
30 bucks for a 16 '' pizza is not a good value
i was told they had opened up somewhere on bathurst and wilson but i 'm not entirely sure . i could have been lied to .
excellent . get there between 4-7pm for a great happy hour .
the staff here are very friendly especially larry .
the sangria and mojitos were awesome as well !
taki 's is going to be on my short list of great west side restaurants .
this is a really nice beach club . it is huge and there are 3 pools to jumpin .
i thought the tap list was great even though i did n't have a beer .
this place is pretty good . do n't let the chipped paint on the walls make you think otherwise .
the chicken was medicore nothing special .
the prices were a bit expensive .
ambiance is pretty run of the mill & it 's quite dark inside .
the food is much better than your typical bar fare and they have very reasonably priced wine on tap .
three stars for clean store , nice color scheme , neutral service , and clean but unexciting food .
total was $ 17 and some change .
the shrimp was n't deveined . not a huge issue , but the big problem was that the chicken was raw .
i would n't come here unless there were no other options . i honestly do n't get the good reviews of this place .
the men 's restroom was filthy with water or something on the floor .
my perception of her talking at me was that i was doing something very wrong and i am stupid for trying it .
i also tried the bramble - which is a cocktail made with blackberry moonshine . both were delicious !
it 's cheap and affordable and the portions are average sized , but reasonable .
south point is going to be awesome when finished .
for $ 150 i would expect the food to be great .
as for alcohol it 's bottled beer and a few selections of wine only here .
the wine is good ( but overpriced ) and the service is fine , but the entrees seem about 10 dollars overpriced a piece .
not a roll that we disliked .
prices are decent , and service is super nice .
was disgusted . hair in food looked like it was from his beard .
they had a good selection of bottled beers but nothing on tap .
beer menu is severely limited with only one or two decent beers not made by budweiser .
even the fries had very little taste to them , but the ranch helped with that and made the meal edible at least .
immediately told the server i received the wrong side .
most of the food was around $ 15 bucks , so for a theme spot it 's not bad .
i took a look at the beer list and was pretty impressed , as they had at least fifteen different beers on tap , plus i think that they had a bottled beer list as well .
i loved the hardwood design inside and the lighting was perfect in my opinion .
the theme is quirky but kind of annoying .
i spent a total of $ 53 not bad .
awesome specialty sandwiches in a cool local neighborhood shop -- i recommend checking out the back patio which has a really cool design and great for hanging out with friends . it 's also dog friendly which is a huge plus .
i did have iced tea , which was awesome anyway .
wow , i was really surprised by this place .
inside the hooters casino and hotel , this place is pretty cool and relaxing from all the hooters hubbub out there .
good eats for good prices .
there 's no way it was fair for him to pay for it !
the buffet was ok. not great , not bad ... . just eh .
the only thing that i might say is even better than the food was the service that we got from our server , jonathan .
we rang the bell for hundred times but no one ever answers us , finally got someone to ask for water , waited for one hour to get it .
i ordered a steak bowl and my boyfriend ordered a taco salad and both were very tasty . the steak had some really nice flavor to it .
the prices are a little high but the food is awesome !
the atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice as well and perfect for a cozy date !
the lamb was delicious both times i had it and the chicken and duck lettuce wraps , with the wasabi mustard is absolutely fantastic and definitely the appetizer you should choose .
the only food i had was a delicious and gargantuan boxty that was easily sharable between fifteen people . all three bartenders that served me were very cool , quick , and knowledgeable about the draft beers .
i love the location !
prices are slightly higher than normal but their lunch specials are really good deals ( salad , a potsticker , and your entrée for only $ 11 ) .
but the beer is cheap and that 's what you go here for .
also good on price .
barely any cheese and any sauce on the enchiladas , there was a lot of chicken inside , but very little flavor .
the sangria was strong , but not too sweet .
the vinegar in the sunomono was overpowering . the rice was hard and the sake too fishy .
i only can imagine huge picture windows so that both inside and outside could take advantage of the view .
great spot , good people , affordable prices .
the wine list is great and not too intimidating .
the total bill for all 3 was somewhere around $ 120 ... money well spent for the extraordinary food and service .
my eyes hurt with all the cheap florescent lighting in here .
i know i had a perplexed look on my face and the waitress was n't interested in asking me what the problem was .
the flavors were incredible and it came out piping hot . the appetizer of the buffalo wings were also delicious .
sad to say , but stouffers lasagne its better ( they understand to put sauce ( which is way worse ) between layers , but they know how to construct it !
not too expensive , but fair .
the chicken fingers are good and the prices are decent ... $ 5 lunch plus a sundae is a good deal .
i travel a lot and i can say we are very lucky to have a restaurant of this caliber in las vegas .
it was a nice variety . i had the vegetarian chili , and the pioneer , which was a huge pastrami sandwich .
while the price i paid was $ 32 for the ragu , it was a huge portion .
maybe they 'll get the message at some point that accepting debit and credit is good for business .
the were not joking it only takes 180 seconds , and we were shocked when the cashier said that it would be delivered to our table .
love this place ! my family went here in august and it was great food , the bomb service great ca n't wait to came back
the decor was so bad it was distracting .
instead of getting different cocktails we got a pitcher of lime mojito ( menu gives it a pretty name - big spoon 4 servings ) . although the menu said one serving each has one ounce of alcohol , it 's very light , almost like drinking lime juice .
such as pillows , fabric , and the lighting hung in weird places .
the orange chicken was good , nothing too special , but the beef pies are amazing !
the manager aaron is a great guy . terrific service good drinks and you ca n't beat there happy hour drink specials and blue berry cheese cake .
it seems like the lighting was a bit dim if i remember correctly , but the ambiance was a nice typical `` restaurant '' y feel .
in total , i paid just under $ 7 for a slice of deluxe pizza and a can of coke .
this bar on mill is a great place to hang out - a fun atmosphere and it does n't smell bad ( which is a plus if you know mill ) .
three times ( twice by phone , and once in person ) i would ask a question and get the wrong answer .
they have awesome daily specials and they have an impressive collections of sides like fried squash and banana pudding .
hostesses were pleasant , we were greeted within a minute with cassie our waitress who was great .
i am always happy when i leave here . they have my favorite beers on tap and really good food .
had the elixir iced tea to drink and that was nice , would have liked a larger glass .
and the price is cheap especially for all the food you get .
i also though the love locks gate decor was super cute .
the chicken was a little bland and too peppered for my liking , my fries were soggy , the salad was good ... paid about $ 14 for lunch .
the decor inside is pretty nice , but it got packed quick .
probably only snafu was ordering a bottle of wine to have `` with our food '' come out as soon as we ordered it - a lovely malbec .
they have a great happy hour - which goes all day until 7pm with $ 6 cocktails as well as other drinks available .
however other times my order will be slightly wrong or they will forget to bring something or they wont refill my drink for almost the entire meal .
the ribs where dry and didnt care for them but i could have ate plenty of more chicken .
they brought the wrong appetizer to the table , took that away then took another 20-minutes to get the right one to us . then brought the wrong entrees , and again took another 20-minutes after those were taken away before getting our food .
i ordered a frozen alcoholic beverage ( ca n't remember the name ) but , it was amazing !
nothing fancy , though , and the walls and carpeting in the hallways were especially worn and in need of replacement .
it 's cheap and good .
spiced duck breast - my favorite dish from all of the ones i tried that night .
it was also just as bland !
excellent food , great drink selection .
the restaurant lighting is also kind of funny , it 's not dark or light ... just something in the middle which gave you a weird feeling .
cranberry , orange juice , sprite and deep eddy vodka was a hit if you enjoy a lightly sweetened drink .
great quality for a reasonable price .
good place for a cheap drink .
they have amazing sweet tea along with many other alcoholic beverages .
it was good but i wish it had a sauce of some sort .
not sure what happened here .
fish is fresh and fantastic . i love the noodles .
i was extremely upset and said i was going to post a yelp review and she said go ahead .
a very pleasant surprise !
the ramen is perfectly al dente , and the flavors are just right .
so much potential , yet the result is awkward and kinda drab .
the service is impeccable ! friendly and courteous !
everything was super white and shiny with marble tables ... so it kind of felt like i was in a washroom .
this place was absolutely terrible .
i had a grilled cheese ( which i know is definitely not a specialty of theirs ) , but their fries were bland and under-seasoned .
it 's kind of awkward .
as for the drinks : -after all , the bar was just calling out to me and although i had hoped to see more beers on tap , unfortunately , a majority of their beer list was bottled .
he was rude , disrespectful , and lost a customer .
so it 's pretty affordable .
by the way , they make an amazing raspberry arnold palmer .
supposedly it had 3 different kinds of tequila , but i did n't even catch a buzz .
only negative , not many beers on tap , we ordered three times before we got a beer listed that they actually had on tap : (
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
drinks are really expensive though - even water costs money !
very good selection and price range .
both were very friendly and welcoming . the drinks were on point and the food was delicious .
servers were friendly and the dining room is open and comfortable .
the food was very good and inexpensive ( $ 6.95 lunch special . )
the specials were perfect on the drinks too !
i asked for a blended margarita and was told they only do on the rocks . what kind of bar does n't have a blender ?
we ordered all over the map ... tofu , chicken .
but seriously , the croissants ... they haunt my dreams with their buttery flakes .
the flavour is good and not too dry .
we got wine and beer , they have a good selection of drafts and bottles if you like beer .
my family came to eat here when visiting my brother in town and we all really enjoyed our experience .
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
the decor was atrocious ( i would rather not have to look at a statue of a naked man while i am eating ) and the walls were covered in pictures of half-naked people and pin-up girls .
great veal risotto . best tiramisu i 've tried yet .
asked for our drinks three times , finally got one but cancelled the other because i did n't want to pay for a thirty minute wait .
the food is consistently very good to excellent . service is pleasant , knowledgable , and efficient .
people also complain that the décor is outdated . i do n't know about that , but i liked the décor a lot .
blah . no one was mean and bottled beer is bottled beer but i might as well have stayed home .
the decor was a little minimalist - one nice accent wall , but then it looks like they ran out of money for decorations .
only had cocktails but will return to sample the menu .
the food is very well priced and very good quality .
the food was amazing ! the desserts were even better !
at $ 23 it was not cheap .
very reasonably priced as well .
the only thing on the walls was paint .
i ordered another drink as the beer flight was hardly anything .
the chicken and steak satay and the crispy noodles with shrimp were tasty , but the bacon-wrapped scallops were stupendous .
the colour scheme and lighting was subdued but elegant making think it was going to be expensive .
i recommend requesting to sit near the window to get a nice view from the 31st floor .
there can be all the reason in the world for a restaurant owner to have a cash only policy , but as the customer , it 's incredibly inconvenient .
no draft beer - but they have a good bottle selection .
wait staff very friendly and attentive .
the service was very slow and the server did n't know the difference between a draft and bottled beer .
margaritas were n't strong at all , they tasted like there was no alcohol in them .
the selection of draft beers looked o.k . nothing outstanding but their bottle selection sucked .
do n't go in expecting decent service if manager/owner is not there .
it 's cheap and quick .
prices are high but your paying for the location .
they also offer groupings regularly which is awesome .
step up your customer service and you will be solid , btw `` tips are not mandatory and you should have been happy i gave you 3 after waiting forever .
city center is boring . unlike other major resorts ( bellagio , mandalay bay , luxor , venetian ) , there 's no beautiful gathering place and nothing really fun .
i made the mistake of using it and my duck udon tasted horrible .
pork - it was just ok. vegetarian - this was the worst meatball .
the flavors were all very similar .
first of all it 's in a great location , right on mill ave. you go up a flight of stairs and you 'll be greeted and seated usually fairly quickly .
off the happy hour menu , we ordered calamari , stuffed mushrooms , a glass of red sangria and a glass of perfect passion .
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
chicken is tender and delicious .
the food is good and it 's pretty cheap .
the prices here are fair .
we ordered chicken korma and half tandoori chicken . the korma was very rich and the chicken was tender .
so for fast food it has a nice relaxing vibe .
great food and service ... 4 formaggi pizza was crisp and delicious ... perfect martini ( served in a traditional and normal-sized martini glass , not one of those silly , undersized things that you see all over that look like a dainty , squashed wine goblet ) .
puke under tables , women 's bathroom horrible , smell , glasses in sink ... .
my supervisor got the lemon chicken and was excited that they offer brown rice .
the decorations were good and the atmosphere was nice .
great food , exceptional customer service , and love the atmosphere as well .
we were surprised it was n't more crowded the saturday night we went , but this is the best steakhouse we 've been to in las vegas , and we will definitely return again .
food is n't anything special ( although still delicious ) but the staff and ambiance is so amazing that the price tag is 100 % worth it . 100 % recommend .
and price is a bit high for quality . but this is a decent option to dine .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
was a nice experience on our road trip
i had the shanghai style noodles , and they were bland and flavorless .
the portions were huge and the pancakes were tasty but everything was overpriced .
nothing like a dinner meal that costed only $ 6 .
we plan to return but , jenni please turn down the garish annoying overhead lighting !
the bartenders were friendly and attentive even though you can tell this is a bar that typically sees regulars .
we had the cadillac margaritas ( top shelf ) and they were great !
it 's definitely a place i 'll be returning to : )
i love their white pizza and this is one of those rare places that a simple thin crust cheese pizza is delicious .
the prices are very reasonable .
the beer was fine , and if i had known the dos equis was only 3 dollars a bottle i would have stuck with that rather than the negra modelo .
the unlimited beer/wine was nice , but there was only one craft beer on tap , which was disappointing .
food was decent , but it took over 40 minutes to get it .
owner and workers seemed eager to please and seemed like good people . i wish them luck .
the original one in vegas .
not worth waiting , especially if you do n't have to .
fantastic cocktails from their lounge ( we took a ride share , do n't drink and drive ! ) appetizers !
the uniforms were stylish , sort of a boris and natasha kinda thing .
it 's an awful piercing fluorescent white light that makes you uncomfortable .
beer selection was weak as well , and their bottle menu was inaccurate .
not too expensive either .
there is probably 7 chunks of chicken .
the one thing this place has going is the service- the waiter was very friendly and helpful , genuinely wanted our experience to be good and was excited to recommend dishes .
i have tried the masala chai ( an indian tea brewed with different spices and herbs ) .
the bar was n't super packed for a friday night but we were also there at 5:30. i had a moscow mule & the sucker punch both super delicious drinks & the queso burger .
for a quick review : service for the most part was quick and courteous .
in their defense , the bottled beer was good .
my favorite sushi spot . sushi is always fresh and tasty .
the answer is that it was n't amazing , was n't bad , somewhere in between .
as for the price , that was also very cheap .
not sure what happened , but hopefully that wo n't happen again !
that was very refreshing .
the food is what i expect every time , especially for the sale price i 'm paying .
i probably should 've just stuck with the chicken .
good drinks and food !
is it just me or is lighting just crap at every hotel ?
i got the chicken salad , which to me was plain .
- and the result was a really unique and absolutely delicious beverage .
the drinks are cheap and tasty .
the sopes are probably one of my favorite meals on the menu .
their pizza was less than impressive little caesars even makes a better pizza for five dollars .
the $ 8 glass was a better value compared to the $ 14 glass great service
lunch was a bit pricey at about 50 $ , but considering i got a drink , this was n't too bad .
great wine list too .
my favorite salsa was the spicy green jalapeño salsa , a fair amount of heat , but so flavorful .
i was disappointed they did n't offer any beer on draft .
the lunch prices they charge are fairly reasonable , but do not match the prices they have online or the quality it should be .
second time i went there , they served cashew chicken with one big piece of chicken that is still raw and cold .
the price of the food is quite reasonable .
the drinks are very strong so be careful !
the music is exciting but a touch loud .
awesome pie ! the staff was very courteous and friendly .
the quality is good . prices reasonable .
the homemade donuts with homemade margarita sauce was outstanding .
the crab is amazing .
to our surprise they had crossed our name off the list and the pager did not go off because it was dead or something wrong with it .
i think everyone at our table had either wine or beer ( they have an ok beer selection , but nothing fancy , and only bottles ) .
it was delicious . i had the steak and chicken .
this place is great !
the prices are reasonable taking into consideration todays inflation .
my favorite attraction is the gondolas at the canal and the italians singing while you are riding them .
ok - it was not sparkly and shiny , but not dirty either .
this place is pretty good . do n't let the chipped paint on the walls make you think otherwise .
not over easy - raw .
the place is cute and the ambiance is good .
no beer on tap , though , which is disappointing .
the service wad a solid attempt for excellence , but sadly they forgot 2 of our orders twice.. regardless , they were super kind .
the chocolate there is high chocolatier art . beautiful and tasty .
bonus is that it is n't too expensive for strip food .
very fast and friendly service as well !
i know it is located at a high end casino but ouch for 2 tacos for $ 17 .
the place has really cute decor and a nice patio with string globe lights and artificial grass .
the interior is nostalgic , sure , but really just cluttered and painful to look at .
when i went , i opted for the grilled octopus ( $ 10 addition ) , but it was hands down the best octopus i have ever eaten , great grilled flavor and super tender .
they charged me $ 16 for a chicken chimichanga when it was $ 10 which in itself is ridiculous .
close to the strip without the strips outrageous pricing !
the drink special of lemonade infused with cucumber and mint was also refreshing and delicious .
one drink - their baked alaskan is soooo good .
the food was decent here , but way overpriced and a little on the salty and oily side .
we ordered bottled beers -- their beer selection is good , i will give them that .
a great meal for a very reasonable price .
good service . decent prices .
all in all , this place is cool .
they do have some good happy hour prices but once again their regular prices are kind of on the high side .
the fried green tomatoes were perfectly seasoned and delicious . my wife had fried chicken , which was very juicy and the batter was perfect .
you can do waaaaay better for the ridiculous price of $ 27.00 pp .
good selection of beer , wine ... not at all .
gobi manchurian is exceptional and the buffet usually is too .
the waitress was not attentive or friendly , but i would n't say that is out of the ordinary in toronto if you are paying under $ 50 a person .
service was good and attentive , the seating was comfy and unrushed .
excellent all around . great food and a fabulous wine list .
that smart assed comment might be expected from a cart boy or clerk but come to find out the person i spoke with was ryan , the golf director .
the person behind the counter did a great job , the issue was she was the only person behind the counter .
every time i come here ( about 1-2 times a week ) the hostess seems confused on where to seat people . i know it 's only a couple minutes but the place can be empty and you 're going to wait there while the confused hostess stand figures out where to seat you .
even one of the draft beers was bad !
this place is awesome .
the lines were very long , the workers just seemed pissed off and it was very expensive .
while we did not drink any booze , they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers , wine , and specialty cocktails .
fast and tasty food at a reasonable price on the strip ca n't be beat .
prices are good too .
i only give it 4 stars versus 5 due to their servers needing to be better trained but it definitely does n't take away from their food quality .
after traveling for 9 hrs would of been nice to not have aggravation .
it 's pretty good . good prices .
family comfortable atmosphere and live music .
excellent happy hour prices as well . they have a huge cocktail menu and an awesome draft beer selection
it 's kind of dark and depressing .
i was a bit disappointed that they did n't have draught beer but enjoyed the selection of cans and bottles .
drinks were awesome , i got the $ 5 rosé from hh and the boy tried the beginners luck off their barrel aged menu .
the skewers arrived sizzling hot , and they were delicious .
the design and decor of the place is very beautiful as well .
all i really wanted was to get a couple happy hour cocktail and try more happy hour items .
strange , circular booths with plastic surrounding them in what seems like an attempt to be colorful , playful and modern but resulting in cheap and almost cheesy .
even the bussers are super attentive and nice .
just an unsatisfactory time , which began with awful customer service .
the restaurant was only half full , never even close to busy ) . food took 1.5 hours to arrive , and was cold when it came out .
it 's expensive and the amount is so miniscule as to be laughable .
this is hands down my favorite place to get breakfast in cleveland .
i tried a nice glass of chardonnay , and then switched to beer , both of which were a great temperature .
order a miller lite and was given a draft beer even though i said i hated draft .
ignore the bitching about the prices - it 's fucking vegas of course a pizza will be 17 dollars and not that large .
the pork was n't seasoned , difficult to chew , and overcooked .
everytime someone asks me for a restaurant recommendation , my first recommendation is always the gladly .
creamy potatoes with a gentle coddled egg with a sprinkle of chives and sea salt ... talk about comfort food -- and excellent for a hangover lol !
they barely had any beers on tap , had no jack daniels , but did make a pretty good moscow mule .
food is alright except for they were cold .
we have always enjoyed going and it has been our go to place for birthdays .
the kicker was that they seemed to be using dry pasta and the parmesan cheese we were offered was n't fresh - think of the stuff from kraft you buy in the pasta isle at a supermarket .
the prices are good , they have great deals for lunch .
the interior is dark , but does n't hide the fact that it is in serious need of a paint job .
i tasted the brisket and i did like the flavor a whole lot better than the pulled pork , although , i hated all the fat .
our waiter was both adorable and friendly .
the wait continued until we finally got our food hoping for the wait to be worth it .
both the kibbeh and falafel were well prepared and not greasy at all ! the hummus was delicious too .
portions are decent and prices as well .
food is comparable to much more expensive places ...
the server butchered our order , disappeared from sight for a half hour , and then returns with cold food .
i did n't give it five stars because it was really dark and loud , but it 's such a small intimate space and i 'm not sure how they could improve the darkness without making it less `` swanky '' .
the beer i got ( which was the cheapest on tap besides miller lite ) was not bad .
it does n't have pictures on the walls or an artistic essence to it .
paying for shrimp is already expensive , much less to get ripped off with only 2 small pieces .
up the price a couple of bucks per person and put the deep dishes out , i would gladly pay it .
especially since it 's free if you check in through yelp . but yeah check this place out !
like most resorts on the strip , it is expensive .
the price of things here are fairly priced .
very good burger for the main meal .
we ordered the sicilian pizza , wings , garlic knots and a meatball and everything tasted fantastic .
the margarita was n't anything special either .
prices are somewhat affordable , but a family of 4-5 can easily rack up a $ 60 bill .
the ambiance is nice .
very good service . friendly staff .
when someone finally got on the line , i explained the issue in the bathroom and told her that i did not want to go to the bathroom at night and slip on the wet floor .
nicer hotels here , but we found some fantastic machines and won a bit . great in the summer at the pool with kids .
long ago are the days where we would study in your dining room , enjoying `` bottomless '' chips and cheese from your lovely staff .
also , i got the sweet potato fries and they were heavenly .
i highly recommend the chicken fried steak , the homemade gravy is awesome .
also , i 'd highly recommend the espresso martini .
fantastic waitstaff , fantastically potent drinks far from watered down , and the taste ... wow .
they have a full bar with decent selection of beers on tap , by the bottle and wine .
my chardonnay was wonderful with a very generous pour .
their bread is amazing , though .
wow , had to pay dinner price of 14.99 without a drink .
you order your food which is placed in a plastic freezer ziploc bag.. it 's like buying a fish at petco . do n't get me wrong the food is good but for a family of four $ 70 plus tip is $ $ $ $ $ .
they rank in the following order : 1 ) perfectly grilled cheese also 1 ) bacon & jalapeño ( i ca n't decide which one is better . this one is gooey and has the perfect amount of spice ) 3 ) pesto 4 ) grilled goodness 5 ) mushroom melt also , the sweet potato fries are so good .
the beer ranges from $ 5- $ 14 and the mixed drinks average $ 10 each now to be fair , we had 1 appetizer and the steak trio for dinner .
burgers tasteless and over cooked . one of the chicken strips was n't cooked properly .
sometimes people get sticker shock when they see a menu , $ 8 for a sandwich seems a little high .
friendly staff and fast service . was definitely pleased and happy with the help from the servers .
the dinner was very good value as well - $ 30 total bill .
i had one of the specials , dolmades and gyro . they were wonderful !
the staff is very friendly and helpful .
ambience : 3/5 , the only fault would be that they should invest in new chairs ( very creaky ) and better lighting .
i love the atmosphere , but it was hampered by the smokers .
i wish i the waitress checked on us during the meal , but thats because i wanted to tell her how good the food was .
hostess finally returns and says my food would be ready in an additional 15 minutes .
the only bummer is that they only take cash .
we sampled their chicken and fries , which were fresh , hot and seasoned well .
sorry to say , i will not return .
we got two bottles of cold unfiltered sake which i recommend to all the yelpers out there .
inexpensive especially compared to the strip and a good staff too .
on $ 5 burger night , it is 100 % worth it to head down to the southside and grab 1 or 2. i mean they 're only $ 5 ?
the chandeliers and mirrors gave it a romantic touch and i also loved the tiled wall !
happy hour special seemed like a good deal but the mojito was n't very strong . wine was solid but not on happy hour .
came here for dinner on a good friday and it was packed .
if you are looking for candle lit romance , this may not be the place , but if you want fun , candle lit romance with fabulous food and service this is the place .
a very trendy restaurant .
the restaurant is slightly more formal and expensive than average .
we mistakenly tried to go out to dinner without reservations tonight . we love ohjah , so we were excited when their new noodle house had seating .
i think they should tone down the attitude and the prices , and it would be a perfect place .
there 's also jalapeños peppercinis and chili peppers on hand , as well as hot sauce and steak sauces available .
i wanted to do my birthday here but prices were too high such as 65 per person minimum 12 people and 150 $ for the room to rent .
good atmosphere for relaxing .
drinks were always full .
and bland as well .
best place to grab a spicy margarita ! make sure you ask for matt the bartender to make his specialty drink ( spicy margarita ) .
the food is phenomenal with huge portions for great prices .
i had the chicken dinner which was a lot of food . the problem was the chicken was too dry and quite salty .
this is a fantastic restaurant .
finally , the cocktails were perfect .
great bartender for cocktails and the somm picked the perfect bottle of wine based on my wife 's description of what she likes .
the prices are reasonable .
they have a wonderful wine list too .
the place is a bit small and so it was awkward with our large group in there but he did n't seem annoyed at all that we were taking up half the place .
the music is super loud inside the bathrooms .
everything was flavorful and the portions were huge .
pretty ok selection of beer bottles and draught which is what i was after .
and an amazing environment . staff is attentive and food is always quickly served .
i love this place ! they have tasty affordable lunch specials for $ 5.99 .
i 'd definitely recommend getting the full flight , so you get sorbet , the dessert , and a wine pairing .
i did n't order any beer or cocktails , but looked like a great selection of beer .
my favorite dishes are the catfish and the chicken and waffles . i love the cornbread , as well , it 's very tasty .
took family visiting from town on a saturday morning - a party of 6 and the wait was reasonable .
they also have a great flavored vodka selection , in addition to lots of tequila choices .
this location is horrible .
this place is expensive , i paid $ 40 for one plate , i did n't mind the price but when you pair that with rude service it 's simply unacceptable .
we had a bit of everything it 's all good and fresh .
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
fancy , over rated , expensive .
the menu is full of a variety of flavorful , creative , inexpensive , healthy foods , many of which are vegetarian .
our server jaime m was very attentive , helpful , and nice !
it 's also not that expensive , about 8 dollars for the okonomiyaki
reasonably priced , not too expensive .
lemon chicken ( dark meat ) - we were anticipating that it was like chicken ball with lemon sauce , but it was cutlet style .
we were seated fast and the hostess was friendly .
only thing is on occasion there are certain items on the menu are not avaliable , this happens more then it should which is why i docked it 1 star . another reason for the minus one star is the host is lacking , you often stand there 5 minutes or more before you even get anyone to acknowledge you and ask you how many people .
kind of weird , and not really fitting .
my favorite place for boardgames . they have a good selection of boardgames and video games you can play with , and the best part there is no cover to sit and play .
only shining star was the decor .
been here three times now and have had a great experience every time .
have a seat at the round tables and admire the trendy décor and funky lights .
i think the platter at $ 34 is a good price .
that was frustrating since our waitress was mia most of the time our lunch took nearly two hours !
great location , patio dining , and amazing food !
drinks were fine and they had a good selection of beers on tap .
food was ok. nothing special .
the service is attentive and friendly , even when really busy .
the lights gave the place an uncomfortable feel .
the good news is the beer is cheap .
service was very good and the prices are quite reasonable .
i frequently enjoyed the unlimited beer and wine .
while the food is decent if you 're looking for a salad , their ordering system is not customer friendly and very annoying , i have to place my order with the first employee at the front of the line and then completely repeat the whole order when i get down to the cashier .
the spicy korean chicken was the only part of the meal that was ok. if i had only ordered that it would n't have been so bad .
if you 're here visiting and missing your favorite nyc or sf restaurant then come here .
when the restaurant is silent , if feels weird talking because it sounds so loud .
good value for the price .
i then switched to beer - they have a pretty good beer list available , too .
healthy pours from the bartender . and the menu , while limited , is perfect for nibbling , chatting and wine sipping .
poutine is common here but what really separates this place from others in my opinion is the service , friendly staff , and amazing outdoor atmosphere that had a beautiful ambiance , and lighting ... i loved everything about this place . i would highly recommend it to all
i have experienced better . ( insert farting noise here )
the wine list is ok - make sure to ask for recommendations .
the food is good and decently priced .
and the price is not expensive .
the latter looks like a storm cloud , mysterious and lovely .
ugh , so uncomfortable and an odd design with just 1 arm .
dana also recommended a couple of moonshine cocktails which were great as well .
but i thought the beers were mediocre .
for $ 30 , i probably only got 6 or 7 pieces .
the food is much better than your typical bar , and the drinks are generous and reasonably priced .
the fries had nice seasoning but i did n't like the them .
cold food for a premium price .
a very reasonably priced meal for the quantity and quality of food .
the prices are great too .
i ordered cheesy grits and they were terrible - under cooked , no flavor whatsoever , and just had cheese on top .
i normally do n't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature .
there was barely any chicken or fish in it . the flavors were there but definitely not enough meat .
that seems kind of strange since typically you would use the meat sauce on top of the pasta .
refund the guy behind the counter did offer to make me a new one at no charge .
awful ... the pork was so dry , no taste , veggies were nothing special , mostly onion and carrots , because they are cheap . the sauce ( thai ) was bad , not even sure what it tasted like .
the pasta purses were a little bitter than bite-sized , so it was a little awkward , but the pesto sauce was so tasty , i did n't mind one bit !
final opinion : for the price of admission , i do n't think this place was worth it .
it 's also pretty expensive at $ 22 .
horrible food and horrible service .
good value for the price !
i kind of enjoy how tacky the taste in decoration is .
prices are very reasonable .
it is very nice and makes a great decoration .
if you like 3 hour dining experience with decent food and cocktails which consist of 99 % juice and 1 % alcohol and pay ridiculous price for it , definitely this is a place for you ; )
i do n't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine .
cards are hung from the ceiling , some decor from disneyland is strewn about , but the theme feels incomplete and haphazard .
it was nice and warm , but i thought it was too thin and bread-y , and the red sauce was just very mediocre .
good to try if you never been to the ny one .
cute patio for a nice day .
however , it was late and there were no other options so i decided to go with goat curry . as expected , it tasted like it had been sitting there for the entire day and it was pretty bland for a curry .
the cost is n't bad at all either .
start with a glass of wine , and end with the house coffee , and we were thoroughly impressed .
not sure what was going on ... 5 tables dirty and no one bussing them .
another secret boris spot here .
it might just be the placement of the furniture , but there 's something that kind of feels ... awkward .
the wine list is inspired , the bar & cocktails are unique , even the beers are well selected . finally !
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
no heart felt anything . apparently you do n't care enough about clients having a bad experience , thinking that comping a meal i did n't eat would make things better .
the employees were very friendly .
i am more of a beer drinker than liquor drinker , and while there were only a few beers on tap , it was a good variety .
great drinks ( had tom collins all night ) and the food was fab !
it also just tasted like old chicken and something they probably cooked a couple times before .
huh ? bartenders were ok ... though real slow getting me another beer .
it 's so fluorescent bright in there it feels like you 're being interrogated .
fresh veggies , fresh meat ... there are n't many places to get a good gyro , but this place is one of them .
three stars for clean store , nice color scheme , neutral service , and clean but unexciting food .
only bummer for me was their bathroom lights = ( i know that may be the style they 're going for but i do n't like it when its dark in there . spooky .
the atmosphere is very lively and positive .
not only did the restaurant serve food at exorbitant prices , it served horrible food at exorbitant prices .
got the all you can eat special for $ 35 .
stopped at humble wine bar for their happy hour .
when we asked for silverware the waitress that there were only 5 sets in the entire restaurant .
lunch special was great price .
food is very good . drinks are too expensive .
started with great artisan cocktails which were strong and well made .
under normal circumstances i ca n't justify spending $ 100+ on a meal for two people but during restaurant week we were able to get amazing food for almost half the cost .
somewhat full bar not just beer and wine they do have liquor as well .
so much potential , yet the result is awkward and kinda drab .
after this great experience i decided to try it again at happy hour , which was listed on their website as occurring between 2-7 m-f. when i walked in it was pretty empty the bartender was talking to another customer and finally decided to acknowledge i was there .
unfortunately i do not like seafood and did not try their shrimp or lobster options .
also try the homemade lemonade made with rose water .
i asked for a hefeweizen but no ; they have 30 beers on tap including 6 different ipas , but not a hefeweizen in the house .
no draft beer - but they have a good bottle selection .
our waitress was attentive , friendly , and passionate about the food .
terrible service and terrible food .
every time i visit nyc , i make sure to have halal guys .
rooms : tired looking , stale decor , old school style , no ipod docks , big fat fax machine , difficult to locate lighting , difficult to locate power outlets , no wifi , mediocre bathroom amenities .
price is n't bad .
bartender made amazing cocktails , and even did a `` dealer 's choice '' cocktail for my friend that was made with mescal and very delicious .
clean . very nice owner .
it was delicious . the ciabatta was fresh and the ingredients were perfect .
the short rib was pull apart and tender well seasoned . the pasta was perfectly cooked as well .
i was n't hungry in the first place but i ordered some thai chicken rolls ( i believe ) and the wrappers had clearly not been soaked long enough .
we chose to sit on the patio which was a great choice as we had a pretty quiet meal .
the lights gave the place an uncomfortable feel .
i 'm willing to bet our margaritas had no tequila in them .
rooms were 80 's chic , exterior was dirty stucco , and finding someone to help with luggage near impossible .
only negative was that our waitress did not once ask any of us if we wanted another drink , nor did she refill our water .
the seating at the windsor rd . site consists of patio tables and plastic patio chairs haphazardly arranged in a small waiting area .
the meat is ok but the buns lack quality . in my opinion it 's a knock off of the real thing in a weird cheese sauce kind of way .
the chicken was literally cubed ... .that being said , one friend of mine ordered the macaroni and cheese and said that was delicious .
i 'm glad we ditched oregano 's with their lousy service for the accommodating staff at hula 's , as it has now become a regular hangout for us .
good food for the price you pay , in my opinion !
the meat was dry , full of gristle and lacking taste .
otherwise it 's awkward .
best of all the special was order 2 tapas plates and get a free glass of wine .
we started off with mimosas , i got the peach mimosa and it was the perfect ratio of champagne to peach .
very classy ! expect a hit to your wallet : three of us walked out of there at $ 600 , though we did splurge on grey goose martinis ( shaken table side ) , wine and lobster .
great food , lots of variety and i love the ambience . i look forward to going there once the weather cools down and enjoying their patio !
it came in a tiny bottle and was $ 6 ... ridiculous .
they were n't rude or anything . but they were n't pleasant either .
no high expectations or anything .
and i really enjoyed the full sized cooked tomatoes that were in the sauce !
plus it 's only $ 2 for a tall cold one !
the seafood was the same ( the shrimp was so hard and tasteless ) .
the food is delicious , nice sized portions and reasonably priced .
i guess the biggest downside is the $ is high , but nothing crazy for what you 'd expect at fine dining .
the food was delicious and , of course , the stone crab was amazing .
great place , very well priced and great quality for the price .
from the start with a moscow mule to the end with actions shot espresso , the service was perfect .
do n't bother with dollar margarita tuesdays . they 're so syrupy it 's impossible to drink an entire glass .
the strawberry watermelon drink was also my favorite !
we only do wine and beer at the bar . ''
i 've only tried their iced tea drinks . they also have a few options for non caffeinated drinks .
the tomato and garlic pizza is amazing . the bakery is so so but everything else is awesome
i have to admit the seating area is n't the greatest neither is the ambiance .
great value for the price .
is the fighting over dramatic and corny ?
good value for the money .
like i said , its simply just some chicken thrown on rice .
good mid-eastern food that is reasonably priced .
service was really quick and attentive as well .
the nachos were pretty much just chips w a fair amount of shrimp sauteed in i 'm assuming the mentioned cream sauce and some kind of white cheese melted and hardened onto the chips .
i was n't too impressed with their buffet , which looked kind of sad .
i started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila .
the only thing worse than under cooked potatoes is under cooked chicken .
the only knock is that there was no beer on tap ; bottle selection was good though .
beautiful restaurant and decor . situated between the wynn and the encore .
good selection of drinks and beer on tap but i was dissapointed they did n't have a drink menu so we had no idea what anything cost .
lunch special at $ 5.99 is amazing price and more than enough food .
we only do wine and beer at the bar . ''
we had crab cakes , onion rings , and of course some really good crab .
there were the normal beer options ( no craft ) and the wine was barefoot so nothing to write home about .
just a bad place for 2 people to drop $ 100 .
i also tried some of their cheese selection and as a cheese lover i was really impressed .
i ca n't believe how terrible the service is here .
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
terribly overrated due to long lineups everyday , we decided to lineup to finally checkout the hype and unfortunately looks like that 's all it is .
bibimbap , this is one of those dishes u really ca n't mess up because it 's just veggies , some meat , rice and hot sauce .
still i think the chicken roti is among the best in the city . fresh , tasty and the spiciness is spot on .
also it is quite affordable for vegas at $ 6.99 for a decent portion .
not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses , that were more like scotch glasses , only knock .
i think the bartender may only be good at pouring beer .
i think the prices are a little high , but it 's tasty for sure .
the price was pretty reasonable too .
it 's kind of dark and depressing .
i come here whenever i 'm in vegas . consistently good and fresh .
sandwich was extremely dry and difficult to chew .
the beer list was disappointing .
brunch is a very fun time here so i would recommend you try that for sure
portion was too small = ( we had both a yummy bottle of cabernet and pinot noir from their extensive wine list .
i used the yelp check in offer for a $ 5 , 4 piece broaster meal which is normally $ 9 .
a very good deal for the price .
they have the amazing deal of $ 10 for 3 rolls ! and if you spend over $ 50 you get a free appetizer .
the only complaint i have are about the chairs , quite heavy and uncomfortable to sit in for more than an hour .
i started with the strawberry mimosa ... which was awesome !
loved the lychee frozen lemonade , you can add a shot to it as well !
the beer is cold and i have mixed drinks about feelings .
the overall sandwich and side cost $ 15 plus tax which is pretty expensive , but considering the portion size can feed two average appetites , it 's a good deal .
i really enjoyed having the carol over fries , with slaw ... yum .
prices are reasonable and they have a full bar .
tell your kitchen to check what they sent out because it 's a little ridiculous we paid 4.99 for that .
order a bottle of wine have a salad and share a huge meal .
service excellent too . layla was very fast and friendly .
what 's even more awesome is the lunch price includes alcohol !
what i got was a long but tiny sandwich with only a small amount of meat in it and a lot of sauce . it was mainly a sauce sandwich .
the cost was fairly reasonable but it did take quite some time to order and we waited a bit to get our food .
there were many other types of dessert , but they were all mediocre . oddly , there were also no cheesecake or creme brulee type desserts , which i thought were pretty basic for buffets .
the atmosphere is always beautiful . the vibe is definitely `` old money '' .
i do n't even know what the hell to say about this place beside the food was good and it has some sorry ass service .
it 's also byob and you only have to pay 50 cents per person for recycling .
they have a good tequila list though i was n't drinking tonight .
i have been here a couple of times and each time i have been disappointed .
first , the decor - yes , it 's all about nacho libre with not only images of masked wrestlers on the walls , but the taps were masked too .
the waitress was very pleasant and attentive , though she might 've been the only one in house at the time who could handle customers ... but she explained the menu very clearly for us and other first-time diners who arrived after us .
regarding the drinks , i loved their sangria .
my girlfriend 's favorite restaurant and my favorite italian restaurant in the area .
it 's very authentic and decently priced .
bonus is that it is n't too expensive for strip food .
my favorite thing had to be the pool .
they had some beer of draft so that was cool , just mexican beer though which is n't very exciting .
drinks were fine and they had a good selection of beers on tap .
service was great , and i really like their lemon infused water and the cute glass jar they use for milk .
great crab cakes , wonderful mango chicken salad with jicama and excellent ceviche but the table side guacamole was standard fare , nothing special .
and for a great price .
we 've tried the bacchanal buffet and the food was bad considering the price . food and desserts were both terrible , we felt that we wasted money .
$ 6 on top of the original cost of the six-pack is a lot more than i want to spend .
i 've been here 3 times since they opened ... it 's that good !
verry fast service from server to kitchen and kitchen to server took about 15 max 20 mins for our food to get there .
husband had green curry chicken and he was pleased as well .
a great place to relax and hang out with your friends while playing board games .
the staff is very friendly , even when it is super busy they never seem annoyed or unhappy .
they also have a fantastic happy hour with drink specials .
the staff was nice and friendly .
i would recommend this place to everyone ! it 's amazing .
staff was very helpful and attentive .
not only are they slow but every single time i get food here my fries are old , dry , cold hard and disgusting .
what a great place to eat .
the beer was excellent and the prices are pretty good .
looked like they had a good selection of beer on tap , even though i did n't have any .
a weak beer selection with the bar running out of the crafts ?
the owner said it was a slow night when we were there , but only 2 tables were open .
great food and drinks the whiskey flight is a great deal with lots to choose from .
the outdoor eating area is wonderful on a nice evening . highly recommend !
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
lost of different beers on tap and even more in the bottle for you beer drinkers .
food was tastey , and it was perfectly prepared , but wish there was more of it .
the place is small and intimate but with a warm and inviting atmosphere .
$ 33 for the buffett , it was good .
i was really disappointed the first time i tried this place . the sushi was just mediocre and the dessert was probably the worst i 'd ever had .
do n't use the bathroom and do n't expect a clean interior .
the egg on my burger was over hard . in all my times of ordering a `` dirty '' burger , i 've never had the egg fried hard .
that immediately gives the feel of a gallery ( duh ) however the dominance of abstract paintings on that white background becomes overwhelming at a certain point to the point where your mind is begging for anything else .
normally , i would n't be too concerned about that but we had show tickets and one does not keep justin timberlake waiting .
with a beer and entree you 're looking at around $ 25- $ 30 per person for a disappointing meal .
the location of this hard rock was great - right next to the river with a huge christmas tree out front .
had a great experience and i 'd definitely order from ronald 's donuts again ! thank you !
exceptional food and wine list to match !
would it have been so difficult to ask us if we still wanted the order as they had no quail egg ?
i had a great first impression as i walked in , as this has to be one of the most nicely decorated fast food places i 've been to .
the pizzas are bland and i can honestly say that this is the only place that i have ever had to add salt and pepper to a pizza so that it tasted like something more than cardboard .
the margarita was n't anything special either .
love the decor of this place .
i do n't drink but they had a huge selection of wine and beer .
the hummus was also nice and creamy and they gave me lots of it .
the service is excellent , probably the best service i have had at a restaurant . we recommend this place to everyone !
the stuffed dates were pretty good , and the house wines for $ 5 a glass were good as well , though apparently they do n't know a merlot from a cabernet .
two stars only because of the staff , otherwise would be 1 star for no wait to be seated .
you will likely spend at least $ 9-12 her per person for lunch if you do the 1/2 and 1/2 combo with a drink but i always leave stuffed .
the service is quick and friendly , prices are cheap for the quality .
the bread dipped in marinara was yummy- but again it 's pasta- just pasta ... nothing that special .
cheap drinks and good food .
that fish was definitely not fresh and for $ 14 , it was tremendously overpriced .
especially for the price !
lots of conversations , cell phone and in person , filled the air , with nothing to absorb all of the sound .
staff was super friendly and played really good music .
this all came to only $ 50 per person , which in most lv places similar , would be $ 100+ per person .
the food we had was delicious . we both started with a chilled soup , which was amazing .
chicken kara-age was boring , unless you like plain fried chicken .
the margaritas are delicious , had the watermelon ginger , it comes with a slice of watermelon .
asparagus was hard enough to require a knife to slice and bland .
we both ordered a drink , mine a happy hour priced cider & my ma ordered the molly margarita- made with jameson .
the beer glasses were n't even frothy , and the beers on tap that arrived were n't even cold .
to be fair , the taste is fair but for $ 30 per plate .
all 6 of us agreed that all the crunchy fried rolls were not very good ... .it was fried so you could n't really taste the fish inside to tell what kind of fish it was or whether it was even fresh .
basically , you 'll pay ridiculous prices but the fish quality is actually good .
and very reasonable price !
the music is great .
the wine selection was fantastic !
the top half was actually quite tasty , but unfortunately everything underneath was not -- very bland and the thick translucent noodles turned me off greatly . my husband got the pad thai and that was actually pretty good .
we wait around for a few minutes then finally another guy and the original guy we spoke to up front to ring us up for oxtail fries .
pretty good food and for only about $ 20 !
my one complaint was that the men 's bathroom was shockingly dirty and in serious need of repair .
if i only knew , i would n't pay 44 dollars for two adults and a child .
the decor is confused .
it was great ... much better than other similar chicken terriyaki bento boxes i have had at the other restaurant .
the prices were very reasonable .
i understand they 're running a business , but charging $ 9 for water is ridiculous .
i also ordered 10 amazingly delicious samosas and 2 roti .
there is cheap parking behind the building ( turn in by the post office ) and there is basically floor to ceiling windows with great natural light that faces liberty avenue .
no beer on tap , though , which is disappointing .
good recommendation on wine .
this place is clean and beautiful .
well drinks are pretty weak , so i stick to beers .
came in from out of town and stumbled upon a gem . carne asada was amazing and staff was very friendly !
the space is beautiful but is completely overhyped .
the service was excellent and was truly impressed with their `` combo pan roast '' ( shrimp , lobster & crab ) its the only thing that will be bringing me back . was not a very big fan of the complimentary bread they provided .
yes , you 're eating in a strip mall , so it is n't very fancy and you 'll look pretty cruddy under the fluorescent lights ... but who cares ?
finally made it here last week .
the deals are pretty good , too .
i would rather spend the extra 5 $ to go somewhere nice .
food/drinks are also reasonably priced .
probably best to order an appetizer only . main dishes were disappointing and i actually think i feel sick from the disgusting burrito .
they do n't serve hard alcohol but have beer and wine .
good value for the money .
i ordered a mojito which was made just right .
both were lacking in flavor and the 3 prices of chicken in my pot pie were each about the size of their salt shakers so not really `` hand shredded '' with attention to detail .
we also like to sit on the patio , and it has pretty much become a smokers den . hopefully the restaurant will get a bit of a makeover soon to bring it on par with the newer locations .
we had really good wait staff .
while wines are $ 7-10 and though they only offer 2 beers , they 're extremely cheap at $ 3 .
i read over the menu before going thinking to spend 30 bucks for my date and i. the total was 58 dollars excluding the tip .
the food is great and my wife and i have now become regulars . keep up the great service - tal
i 've stayed in the venetian about a year or more ago and everything was fabulous .
the lunch specials are a great price at about $ 5 !
sadly they did n't offer any hard cider , but a friend was happy with the beer on tap .
this place was ok and decent price compared to the other hotels on the strip , of course would be more expensive .
excellent atmosphere , paired with an excellent beer and whine menu .
the fries that it came with we 're pretty mediocre and had a weird after taste .
we walked in for a pint b/c it was hh - which is a fantastic deal !
i love this place the gyros are great , and only $ 5.99 with a drink .
easily my favorite ramen bar in town i frequently go there with my girlfriend it 's one of our favorite places to eat in las vegas . the ramen is great .
not sure what 's up with the decor though .
poor guy was alone and there were a lot of pissed off people .
as a meat-lover , here 's the right place for me .
i know it 's going for an authentic old-time appeal - but it 's dark , dirty and kinda icky feeling .
you can chill out on their couches and enjoy a great scene or jump up and take your peeps on in some shuffle board .
his soup was pretty good . my food on the other hand was n't .
their prepared salads here are quite good and their breads ( which is really surprising ) .
ordered a beer in the bottle as they only had the typical `` crap '' in my opinion on draft .
i loved the unlimited beer and wine .
i 'm very understandable , but having to wait over 20 mins to put a food order to go is ridiculous .
great place if you love wine . neat place to go to -- the food is pretty good , the atmosphere is fun -- somewhat on the noisy side , but it is worth the wait .
we got lucky and did n't have to wait to be seated but anytime i pass by here in the evenings it 's always full and always a wait to get in .
great value especially for the price point .
feels like a new place with the awkward paper table coverings .
lost of different beers on tap and even more in the bottle for you beer drinkers .
great food & feeling like your in socal without having to spend $ $ $ on gas .
brought along our own bottle of vino to enjoy some good italian food .
my chicken was correct but tasted like old tainted chicken .
the food is very good and reasonably priced .
back to the food , considering the plates were only $ 1- $ 2 dollars a piece , i was expecting terrible quality but was surprised .
in my opinion , it 's a perfect compliment to all spicy curry dishes .
i absolutely love their souffle . you have your choice of chocolate , vanilla , or both flavors combined .
over priced broccoli and 14 dollar drinks were just mediocre .
the chicken rice was the worst , though .
the meal was good and reasonably priced .
the food and drinks are great , service is good , great bar atmosphere later at night - all in a great location ! i love their prosecco cocktail !
i am very disappointed with the happy hour choices of cocktails .
i am in a delightful venue .
oh , and the gin martini was nice and dry .
the octopus is just ok but the grill foie gras is excellent and worth the $ 30 price tag .
only thing i did n't like about the room and the hallway was the decor .
the only good part i saw was the selection of beer on tap .
we waited for almost an hour even though we had a reservation . luckily they gave us free bbt as compensation .
next time i 'm in town , i 'd love to stop by for more delicious pizza !
he ignored me the whole night ( it seemed ) , and when he did serve me , it was totally like `` what the f & % k you want a $ $ hole ! ''
it looks like they painted the walls , slapped some mismatched kirkland 's crap on the walls and called it a restaurant .
then its a decent price .
the tilapia was very good . the halibut was excellent again .
fun eclectic but comfy atmosphere , great service , and delicious food .
i was n't drinking but looked like a good beer selection .
food was n't anything special and the hostess comped a lot of our bill when she saw us sitting with our legs up .
i was n't overly impressed but it is as advertised .
the ice cream was definitively soft serve and deliciously creamy . the sesame flavor was very nice as well .
relatively quiet but can get loud if there are too many students price : 4.5/5 , $ 5 per dish and between the two of us , it came out to $ 20 .
i had a craft beer and my wife a glass of wine . my wife is very knowledgeable about wine and the suggestion by the bartender was a perfect fit for her pallet .
i think that was cool , too .
we loved the who 's your daddy , shrimp lovers and popcorn lobster .
lebanese menu is amazing . all made from scratch .
good food at a reasonable price .
oh yeah ; and i almost forgot if you 're going to use the restroom as a guy , the urinal is one giant cast-iron bathtub ... it 's hilarious : - )
good food for a good price .
that sauce would taste good on anything .
maybe it 's not filthy - maybe it 's just the lighting and decor that makes it look like that way .
went here late at night with my friend and was greeted immediately by a friendly server .
would recommend the cucumber salad as a palate cleanser if you 're going for the platter , it 's a welcome vegetable break !
make sure you know what you want .
all around a great dining experience and super delicious dinner !
prices are very reasonable .
the tacos seem really cheap for the price but they are bite-sized .
unless you have a thing for weak , tasteless cocktails , i suggest ordering a beer or glass of wine .
poorly trained staff and a manager that is rude and clueless .
the food was pretty good and drinks reasonably priced .
great atmosphere , food and a reasonable price tag .
the chicken was our medium steak was week done with minimum seasoning . shrimp was over cooked , and one of my parties ' steak tasted spoiled .
pork tasted good and not felt oily .
i ordered the wok fried chicken which was tough and far heavier on fried then chicken but in this case that was probably a good thing .
the mac and cheese was tasty yet the mussel in the linguini was not fresh and left a disgusting odour and taste , i ended up leaving it behind .
i started with a rum and bramble from the menu , which was well balanced , but once he realized i knew something about cocktails , he made me an amazing mai tai ( and i do n't like tiki drinks ... ) .
definitely recommend , it 's a great spot .
nothing about it satisfied my craving or was worth the $ 10 bucks that i paid for it .
the service is always excellent and cheerful and even if all you want is your birthday meal , they give it to you with a huge smile and great attitude .
what i did n't like about the food was the way the chicken was cut .
the decor is kind of strange i do n't know why .
decor : it 's so colourful ( not in a tacky `` ugly betty '' way ) i love it !
the only knock is that there was no beer on tap ; bottle selection was good though .
the bathroom was beautiful and spotless but i 'll just say this : i hate bathroom attendants . that is all .
nothing to great , it 's a nice place to hang out and drink at during happy hour though . parking can be a pain but i love sitting outside , having a few drinks and watching the sun set .
i just had some calamari and a glass of water . i sat in the bar area and the bartender was very nice and chatty .
and , the only other negative was the lighting .
food was fresh and delicious and very filling for the price .
the margaritas and mojitos are awesome , but the speciality drinks in the 20+ page menu are why we come here . definitely recommend flipping to the last page of the cocktail menu where they list the top 10 drinks- you ca n't go wrong with any !
and price is higher than others , while food quality is worse .
i most likely will not be returning to that restaurant .
still really good food , i had the margarita pizza and my wife had a shrimp pasta dish . they were the perfect size portion for lunch .
the fruit was wonderful and perfect refreshment for a night out . the sandia loca was a half a watermelon filled with many different fruit .
i highly recommend this place .
i ordered the popcorn chicken poutine and it just tasted like something i could get at st-hubert .
did n't live up to the expectation at such a high price ( $ 45/person with tip and tax ) .
poor service , and worst waitresses who have absolutely no idea what they are doing , food was just average and the worst part is they make constant mistakes on your bills . please i urge all of you to check your receipt in detail before paying
everything was pretty reasonably priced , too .
i 'm not sure if our particular waitress ( team 4 ) was having an off-night but she was pretty rude to us .
no stars for the tired , drab & dusty interior .
good service and atmosphere . no more expensive then other higher end steakhouses on the strip .
that was the absolute worst customer service and made us feel very unwelcome .
the pricing is also great .
anyway , disappointed after spending $ 36 for dinner for one .
the food is very good and very reasonably priced .
the bathroom lighting is terrible and the promised make up mirror is missing .
this salmon has a bbq glaze that is not overwhelming and perfectly suits the fish !
the orange chicken and cucumber salad make for a nice addition to the sushi .
first impressions ; it looks pretty fancy inside , kinda shiny , and the waiters and waitresses use littler ipad things to take your order .
always a favorite of mine , i can never wait to get back here anytime i 'm in town . try the plum sake , ca n't go wrong .
it was n't as creepy as some people made it sound .
i got a beer sampler and a couple of the beers were ok , but nothing really impressive .
this restaurant is just like a hard rock restaurant . most of the servers there wore makeup like alice cooper ... that was pretty cool .
: ) i 've been going to grouchy john 's for years and will continue to do so .
the waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were .
the decoration and interior really suck unfortunately .
the prices are good as well .
the bread and sweet potato fries were super soggy and the pasta looks like it was someones leftovers literally thrown into a takeout container .
with that , the price is ok. i probably would n't pay $ 12 + tax for a burger combo , even if it 's very good .
my favorite is their baked spinach and fish rice .
food was great and the prices are reasonable .
i love the crusted salmon with the fried spinach - enough for dinner and leftovers .
super cute place . the inside looks great !
the food is really good and pretty cheap .
he 's creepy , not classy , not sophisticated , and forced his way into our table 's conversation .
i do n't think they were intentionally loud , or any louder than any other hotel , just that the doors and walls were that thin .
i 'm glad we ate here .
highly recommended . the sauce is phenomenal , meatballs taste just like mom used to make , and prices are reasonable .
the toilets in the men 's bathroom were filled to the top with urine and would not flush .
even the sesame balls - which were previously the best i 've had - are just horribly mediocre now . and they 've removed the chicken feet !
the bad : the bento boxes are sad ... i was sad looking at it .
the bathroom was weird . it had glow in the dark graffiti everywhere which made it poorly lit and not at all good for fixing your lipstick .
i 'm kind of creeped out sitting at a table and seeing how dirty the booths are , even in the very dim lighting .
honestly for their price this place is pretty decent .
the girl at the register did n't tell us they did not have tea , when we ordered 2 teas -- the only choices were fountain soda ... ..
dinner could be great or absolutely mediocre , not really a gamble you want to take on $ 30- $ 40 per person .
it has a great window to sit at and watch the world walk by .
worst brunch i 've had in some time ... most items were store / warehouse brought vs being made in-house and lacked flavor , no omelet station and desserts were n't good either .
i 've never heard any atmospheric music being played , the carpet is ugly , the furniture is boring and dark , and there is no privacy offered by the interior design .
not sure if our food just sat for too long before they brought it out . it seemed to take awhile to get our food from the time we ordered it but i was hoping it was because they were making it fresh .
i did no drink one , but apparently the margaritas were pretty good and not a bad deal by the pitcher .
expensive as compared to the quality of the food .
interesting characters and sassy staff populate pegasus . dive bar feel but clean .
at $ 85 the price is a bit of a turn off and there are other nice cuts available around a $ 50 range .
also the wine menu is extensive and impressive .
it was n't overly dense or dry , but also not crumbly .
i had about 4 tiny potatoes and about 4 tiny pieces of chicken ... i wish i was kidding .
the first drink they brought me was in a tall beer glass and was disgusting because it was premade syrupy , sugary margarita mix .
so happy this one opened since this is much closer for us than their original location .
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
this is the lettuce that was put on my buffalo chicken sliders . i have no words for how disgusted i am .
the service is terrible .
they are addictive , not to mention delicious .
the decor is confused .
bbq sauce was just perfectly executed !
their beef hash is a specialty and you ca n't go wrong with the different varieties of eggs benedict . specialty omelets with different cheeses are great .
the young man ringing me up had a huge attitude and was a prime example why the minimum wage should n't be raised .
only one i did n't care for was the tempura one with scallops .
while neither my husband or i drink beer , they look like they have a good selection of bottled and draft beers .
the variety on offer was average and expensive for its asking price .
make sure to go try it out !
continued looking around & not able to help us any .
terrible customer service , the owners do n't like to cater to `` ethnic '' people whatsoever .
sandwich prices were n't too bad but $ 5 for a tiny cup of oj is ridiculous .
also , the interior reminds me of disneyland for some reason ... it 's disturbingly tacky .
the fried chicken was way below average . the wings was also below average .
it was in a nice private room .
maybe it 's the whimsical decorations that filled the interior .
i 'm no decor expert by any means , but i did n't care for the fake plants and the furniture was lawn chairs .
also the prices were very reasonable !
great date place with a cozy ambiance not to mention a kind french waiter with a sexy accent .
the house margarita was fine because i like weak drinks .
they seems to have plenty of servers so i do n't understand how the food did n't get to us still hot .
my hats off to these caring owners you will always be successful .
that is the everyday price on the menu , not too shabby .
at this price point , the food should n't be so terrible she is unable to eat it .
my only fear is that this place wo n't last because so many bars in old town come and go : (
the prices are so cheap .
the one bright point ?
it was nice that they had draft beer .
further , i 'm fairly certain one of their bottles of wine which was priced around $ 48 dollars is about $ 32 at mercurio 's in shadyside .
it was n't even bottled , pretty sure it was tap .
their dough is delicious with the perfect amount of salt , yeast and water making for a nicely risen , chewy , tasty base for all of their offerings .
not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses , that were more like scotch glasses , only knock .
they were filled with a fishy puree and also had some larger chunks of lobster in them , and then covered with a terrible sauce .
i think everyone at our table had either wine or beer ( they have an ok beer selection , but nothing fancy , and only bottles ) .
the service is friendly , the prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous . the fish is very fresh and the presentation is creative and very appetizing .
the chicken sandwich was very tasty , with it 's buttery toasted bun and well seasoned chicken .
the setting was nice .
we did n't try any beer but the beer list was impressive .
we ordered a crab cake appetizer ... it could have been a bit crispier , but tasted good .
they had a good selection of beers and something i 'd never seen before , jameson on tap . i 'm very curious as to how liquor on tap works ( and why a mexican restaurant had whiskey on tap instead of tequila ) but we did n't have the time to stay and investigate .
nice specials and cheap prices .
sure beats paying 2-3 times that on the strip .
needless to say , i was quite displeased with the customer service .
the girl who gave me the food at the window did n't even say bye or have a nice day .
i recommend anyone and everyone to at least try this place ! great customer service as well !
my only complaint is that they had cnn playing on the tv disrupting the good vibes .
the one nice thing this location has to offer is very nice outdoor seating .
it 's only a $ 5 cab to the nearest club so why not pay $ 50 less for a room and stay here ?
my boyfriend and i have been looking for a good poke place and this is just the place !
not bad for the price , definitely have had more expensive pizza .
and very reasonably priced .
the whole lunch took over an hour and a half , and one in our party of 7 never got their order . i received no refills and only part of my order arrived when it finally came .
unfortunately they only have a few mixed drinks , beers , and wines - no full bar .
expensive but you get what you pay for service was spot on .
the atmosphere is nice as well .
stopped in to have a late breakfast with the wife .
the only drawback here is that it is very noisy inside .
we made the trek after doing some shopping in scottsdale and we are so glad that we did .
every time i come here i 'm never disappointed .
the service was great . the owner was very personable .
menu small but super good . great little known wine selection at vary reasonable markup .
not necessary for 6 people to give her a hard time .
would be four stars : interior is awful with dirty carpeted floors , handwritten signs everywhere , one tv on in background with no sound , no music ...
margaritas were cheap and good for the price .
good food and good pricing .
the prices are quite reasonable .
it looks a little scary , but do n't let the carpet on the floors scare you .
i do n't mind to pay for $ 35-40 per person if the quality justified .
dinner is rather expensive but still not bad
needless to say , we will not be returning and would not recommend it to anyone .
my food was cold , so much so that the cheese was not even melted .
not to mention the person taking the order act like they ca n't hear . the only reason i gave it one star is because you have to .
very good , although a little pricey at $ 33 for a dozen .
5 stars for the decaf , it was like a dessert , sooooooo fragrant and good . they had caffeine free tea too , really fragrant and fruity .
however , i found the rolls to sort of bland ( not much flavor ) .
this drink was also good .
others in my party had the key line martini , a mango one , and one with a jalapeno and all were excellent !
this place is pretty cool .
they have only two or three beers on draft and the rest come in a bottle .
oh , and the jasmine tea ( iced or hot ) was good as well .
love this place have been coming for a while .
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
always friendly staff and i 've never had a bad meal !
the meat was so hard and so tough .
not sure who often i would return as spending almost $ 13 for breakfast for just me is a bit much .
about $ 6 for a slice of pizza is totally reasonable in vegas .
1- i will see start off and say this is a cute restaurant and nicely decorated in the biltmore area .
the decor is confused .
so , overall , for $ 28 ( plus a hefty delivery charge ) , we each got one excellent meal and two pretty good ones .
their lunch prices are cheap and the food was high quality .
the vermicelli with pork had good flavors too .
this may not have to do with the restaurant but as a customer i rather not spend money at a restaurant where the staff and customers are rude and judgemental .
service to get seated was slow , but waitress did a nice job .
i ordered another drink as the beer flight was hardly anything .
for some reason i 'm not a big fan of the stained glass ceiling - it does weird things to the lighting and is distracting and i find it to be just the tiniest bit gaudy .
first time , great experience ! friendly staff and amazing food !
which is absolutely disgusting so of course i said no and the server did not even apologize for dropping the pizza nor did he compensate me for the loss .
it felt almost chaotic . the music was loud - the kind with drums beating that gives you a little anxiety , and there were at least 3 or 4 loud bangs from plates dropped or furniture tipping over .
the food was alright . there was only 2 pieces of chicken and shrimp in the mei goreng .
as for the entree , you really ca n't go wrong with the chicken & waffles . the chicken is cooked perfectly and the breading is full of flavor .
i highly recommend trying it out .
they were ridiculously salty and pretty much inedible .
very limited lunch menu , however , everything was delicious !
we understand that you are a business , but to bluntly tell us that we would have to sign a waiver in a stern tone and to charge us $ 4 each for every cupcake we consumed is laughable .
the total bill was only $ 44 which is a steal for the quality and ambiance of the restaurant .
she also fucked up our bill and tried to charge us twice for a drink we thought .
maybe it was because everyone automatically speaks in hushed tones in a church , or maybe they did some fantastic sound dampening .
the room was mediocre at best . the floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded .
a huge hipster dork scene .
the bathroom is dirty , dirty toilets , walls are nasty , no soap & the water barely trickles out if the faucet .
when i knocked and told her that we called in advance and were assured that we would be seated , she unlocked and cracked the door and said `` sorry , '' and closed the door in my face .
came highly recommended by the locals .
food is great and reasonably priced .
the only 2 beers available was budlight and `` house special beer '' which tasted like piss water .
the avocado on it was fresh on the eggs - and the sauce on top was perfect .
i have been to the barrio queen and number of times for dinner and happy hour . always a good time .
absolutely the worst food experience yet , normally i do n't call or complain publicly .
beers are only available by the bottle , oddly enough .
i felt totally distracted for some reason by the decor and ambiance .
this time ok only .
quality of the food served here is simply great !
about two wings had sauce the rest were dry with no flavor ! i asked for no seasoning on bread sticks and sure enough it was delivered with seasoning .
i noticed the portion sizes are no where near comparable to the dining portion especially given the high price they charge , quality is also subpar .
for under $ 10 it 's a lot of food at a great price .
prices are reasonable too .
expect to spend $ 80-100 with tip for 2 people , entrees only , 4 drinks .
the restaurant was not even that busy . i was extremely displeased and they showed no remorse .
price is $ 20 per person , which is very good for a dinner ayce as well .
the wood paneling on the ceilings reminds you of the grand canyon , but the seating is much more comfortable .
always great service whenever i come here i think they already know what i 'm going to order now .
the food was expensive .
the servers are very courteous , the restaurant is clean and beautiful .
drinks list was well ordered and extensive . tried a new beer , and finished the meal with a hot , sugary cocoa concoction .
i know most beer drinkers prefer piss like corona and budweiser and heineken , but us beer snobs are kind of left in the cold it seemed .
burgers are $ 11- $ 13 which seems to be a fair price with the casino mark up .
however , our food was a bit bland .
never again ... pizza - took one bite and that was it - yuk - among the worst ever - it was crunchy - like biting into a cracker .
we will always pay for quality at fair value pricing , even at a premium .
puke under tables , women 's bathroom horrible , smell , glasses in sink ... .
first of all , the decor was nice . the wood on the wall and the very clean open kitchen was impressive .
the house chardonnay was exceptional but the beer was warm .
not bad and they had a great selection of beers on tap and mixed drinks and wine .
still the value was good for the price paid .
great atmosphere and service , tim was our waiter and was fantastic . food was fantastic !
walking in , it 's definitely a sports bar atmosphere , tv 's are everywhere , it 's got game on and it 's loud .
it is on the expensive side , but their outdoor patio is filled with cushions and facing mill ave so it is perfect for people watching .
the service here was incredible as our server checked in on us throughout the course of the meal and made sure everyone was happy .
along w a bottle of good sake
entrees are a bit pricey , but probably have a good quantity -- i 've always gotten the quesadilla appetizer to eat , and it comes with rice and beans and is very filling as a light dinner .
this place was fantastic .
7:30pm comes around and waitress goes to seat us.. sure enough its at the spots that said reserved !
the chicken was a bit on the salty side .
it was loud and sort of clubby , but that 's part of the experience .
the smallest but one of the most important gestures is welcoming the guests or at least saying hello . but when three hosts up at the stand all ignore you when you walk in is like a slap to the face .
when drunk , finding the bathroom at remedy 's is like a mini maze .
i ordered the meat loaf , which was dry , and the mashed potatoes , which were underwhelming and like the meat loaf , also a bit dry .
i usually order their chicken orzo soup with a side of their potato salad . they 're both seasoned with the right amount of good stuff it makes me feel healthy and happy .
the toppings are perfectly paired together and none overpower one another , i love the nori and fresh fruit options available .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
fancy but somewhat nauseating decor ( i ca n't explain it , but i had problems looking at the ceiling , it has some weird pattern to it ) .
price wise it could be a little cheaper , but i guess it 's reasonable given what other places charge .
the seating at julio 's is very comfortable .
i think there were only 3 or 4 beers offered , draft and bottled .
but i feel these prices are reasonable .
i had a pre meal `` peach infused martini '' which was refreshing and tasty .
dine in is terrible , takes forever to get food and drinks , and it 's so loud that it gave me a headache .
the prices are very reasonable and service is good .
my new favorite place for happy hour ! delicious food and drinks , great happy hour deals , 1/2 off wine ( ! )
`` i 'm too sexy for this mall ... and i do a little turn on the catwalk . ''
honestly i felt like i was paying for the interior decoration and building .
i topped this off with a nice glass of cold wine and it was a great dinner overall .
the lemonade is fabulous and it looks like a great place to watch a football game with the indoor area and outdoor patio .
horrible service ! we had to wait 40 minutes for the waiter to acknowledge us .
it is definitely worth the time and $ $ . for the price you get an extremely elevated and unique experience .
high quality ingredients , unique dishes and great vibe .
this place is really good , my fiancé and i love coming out here every time we get a chance .
they also have great drink options from margaritas , beers , and wine !
food presentation was pretty however the taste ... .
i love the setup inside .
one of the bathrooms didnt have mirrors which i dont like but were clean .
we had a room with a garden shower which was amazing and also a patio with its own little pool .
i met with the bartender/manager who confirmed that there was no place for me to sit .
the only 2 beers available was budlight and `` house special beer '' which tasted like piss water .
on a side note i had the cantaloupe martini and it was great as well .
it 's good for a dependably filling , tasty meal at a very reasonable off the strip price .
my boyfriend and i were pleasantly surprised after trying the real mccoy for the first time !
had all different types of meats and sauces you could mix and match .
hmm the room : wow lets talk about out dated .
unfortunately , this dish was a letdown .
this was one of the worse pizza 's i have had threw the store i had about 2 slices with this one thats it .
the staff is very friendly and you will note by the crowd how popular this restaurant is .
the price is not cheap but not that expensive ( $ 28.95 for the premium set ) .
i liked the beer cheese however , i think it would have tasted better if it were hotter .
great food , good prices .
not a bad bar .
their lunch deal is reasonable at $ 8 and comes with a great soup .
great disappointment . appetizers and desserts were ok but pasta entrees were terribly dry and tasteless .
they let me sample their carbonated iced tea and it was super refreshing .
not the ideal breakfast , but at least i know what to expect .
overpriced mediocre sushi . ramen was pretty good but not worth $ 18 .
only reason i am docking a star is because the interior is pretty cold and stark ( for now - sounds like the interior decor is still in the works tho ) .
the patio furniture is a pleasing turquoise and dark brown color scheme , though up close it looks a bit dirty .
the staff is super friendly too . highly recommend
i absolutely love the variety of naan they offer . keep in mind that their version of spicy is very hot .
the shrimp and grits are good and gluten free .
the price is crazy cheap .
the atmosphere is casual and comfortable .
light sauces and lots of flavor in all the dishes we tried .
it was a nice setting and the decor is very pleasant .
for both of the dine-in experiences the place was pretty empty but service was very slow and unfriendly .
they also have this tasting menu where 10 different dishes are served for around $ 70 pp which to me is a very reasonable price point for what you get .
the drink prices are not listed anywhere but are very reasonable .
their fries looked like machine cut but tasted good .
no draft beer - but they have a good bottle selection .
to be honest the decor is bizarre .
they even have my favorite wine by the glass .
it is really lovely how they present their iced water with a refreshing hint of strawberry .
i tip them , not sure why ... may be because of his only one waiter who was running around and serving all 20-25 people .
only reason why it is missing a star is because of the interior was pretty dark and old .
there were so many road signs and posters on the wall , i 'm really not sure what color the walls were .
it was literally just noodles with olive oil on them . i would have asked for more sauce but it was runny and had no flavor : (
i do n't recall anything about the meat dish , so i supposed it was not very memorable .
started with a cocktail off the menu - there were many with sparkling wine , but didnt love it .
needless to say , we wo n't be returning .
i had the tamales here , and the whole dish was disgusting .
the architecture tripped me up a bit because i was afraid the ceiling was going to collapse .
we also had to repeat our order to the waitress three times and she still got the drink order wrong .
7 $ for a hamburger of this quality is more than fair .
i ordered the peppercorn burger and the moscow mule cocktail ( made with ginger beer ) . both were awesome !
all the curtains were down too which made it unnecessarily dark . mediocre .
nice touch with spicy sauce at the top diablo role - a funky gooey baked mess and so delicious !
i love the chili fish here , it 's really good ( not very hot but savory ) .
i decided to have the watermelon cocktail , was good .
sadly when i looked at the menu today , there was no lobster roll .
loved the pork -- high quality .
the beer was good and cold , but i think i would rather have a draft house beer .
instead of getting different cocktails we got a pitcher of lime mojito ( menu gives it a pretty name - big spoon 4 servings ) . although the menu said one serving each has one ounce of alcohol , it 's very light , almost like drinking lime juice .
was in last night for my wife 's birthday and the food was delicious like always .
when i asked our server about it , he checked with ryan who said that he thought i had been told by the owner that it would be ok to order from the happy hour menu , but that she told him to ring up everything at the regular menu price !
i was a serious fan of the lamb chops i got here .
the interior is not bad .
margaritas were n't strong at all , they tasted like there was no alcohol in them .
the venue was nice , what i saw of it .
food is delicious , well priced .
everything was great that i had here but the standouts for me are the tuna poke tacos , the warm brussel sprout caesar salad , the butter chicken and the bang bang grouper .
true , the prices are pretty steep .
we love the food and drinks .
this place is a total win and i wish i had checked it out earlier but i 'll be coming back soon for sure .
the desserts in shot glasses were also enjoyable .
my server was attentive and polite . i enjoyed my first experience here .
we have never had a bad experience at either location .
the bartender did n't know the beers they had on tap and seemed pretty out of it .
they have a nice selection of sushi and a very large selection of asian dishes .
this place is below ordinary and expensive .
i only came here because a friend wanted to go and i did n't want to argue .
i also ordered a paloma and mango mojito which was absolutely delicious !
we had a few different alcoholic drinks during the meal , all which were unique but delicious .
also , the drinks are cheap .
the 1 only problem is the price , it is very pricy , the main stake meal is 41 dollars .
the cashier was very pleasant and courteous .
i was told they have a good selection of beers on tap .
the restaurant itself is charming and small with a lot of beautiful ethiopian artwork around .
i did try the sweet and sour chicken but the sauce was either very bland or watered down .
i had a great steak here for under $ 20 bucks .
the rice was the highlight of my dish , which in reality is n't even that good .
the earl 's cobb salad was quite tasty and innovative .
about $ 6.95 filled me up and was the quality if a $ 16 meal .
very nice ambience . good food , relatively reasonably priced .
the service is pleasant .
the food is reasonably priced and quite tasty .
a yummy , reasonably priced option on the strip .
the pizza and a drink was about $ 9.00 , good price for a good quality meal .
unfortunately , i do n't drink beer .
it 's annoying and distracting .
ladies , careful when wearing heels ... the floor is slick , or maybe it 's how i walk .
beer - the beer selection was nothing special and they do n't serve it in a cold glass .
the restaurant has an absurdly tacky interior . a shame , really .
the ambiance was great , we had a glass of wine , and the desert was amazing !
prices are very reasonable .
plus , it was very reasonably priced for a decent sized portion .
great food and even a more reasonable price .
huge portions , very flavourful , great price .
the pricing was great .
it was my favourite place to hang out weekly till one fine saturday evening when we were there and someone old a very funny joke . apparently we laughed too loud so the assistant manager came over accusing my party of being drunk and cut us off .
a manager never came by and the server just stared at me when i told her my salad was wrong to the point i asked if she was going to fix it .
good food & lovely sake to start the night with . holla !
price tag not too high .
it 's calm , relaxed , and quiet . beautiful decor and great service take it over the top .
the food was great ! it was fresh and very well spiced .
the interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and is a very comfortable environment .
we ordered buffalo wings not enough sauce and half the bones were broken , that is always weird to me . the cheese pizza was boring and only a kid could like it .
charge you $ 10 for small bottle water where other clubs have free water .
the pho is pretty good - not the best i have ever had but they do have a solid broth and the up charge for extra meatballs is only $ 1.00 ... which keeps my bowl of delish pho under $ 10.00 , so how can you beat that !
we ended up going with a bottle of the house wine which was okay but very cheap .
you wo n't be disappointed .
the bathroom was disgusting ! tissue all over the floor , lights out in some of the stalls , no hand soap , water all over the counter and garbage that was overflowing !
the cold brewed teas were presented very nicely in the glass bottle and there was a variety of options .
the wontons were dry and the sweet sauce with it , leaked out of the container also .
however , the water jug and glasses seemed a little dirty and could have been cleaned better . when the food arrived , it looked great .
the toilets in the men 's bathroom were filled to the top with urine and would not flush .
for almost $ 30 thats not reasonable at all .
i kind of figured from all the annoyingly kitschy signs and decorations all over the place .
my wife is not a drinker , but really enjoyed the french kiss ( 2 cocktails for her , which is rare ) and the berry mojito ( 1st cocktail ) .
we had started with cute little slushies that were very refreshing for a hot day .
the prices are below what you would expect for an establishment of this quality . what you get is great thai food , in a comfortable classy atmosphere , for the same prices you would pay at one of the rushed restaurants in chinatown .
prices are extremely reasonable also .
he and the female bartender who was very nice and i think i hit on were a great duo and handled the surprisingly packed place efficiently !
we ordered the yard size pina colada and strawberry daiquiri . both of them were great !
they had a good selection of bottled beers but nothing on tap .
the karaoke list they have is quite large and i was surprised at how many songs they had .
drink prices are also pretty decent .
they had great specials , like pear and cheese pasta , which was to die for and mussels which also were very good .
they have a decent draft beer selection , and even more in bottles .
i will say that the drink selection was good and they had some good beers on tap .
the guac , which used to taste like it was mashed fresh in your kitchen , full of crab , tuna , or whatever else you ordered , tasted ... lackluster .
always delicious and consistent . the staff allows you time to enjoy your friends and food .
they do n't serve hard alcohol but have beer and wine .
there was a gentleman in a suit who seemed to be the manager and a young lady standing near the entrance so i got her attention and mentioned very calmly that i had already asked our wait staff for a replacement knife and nothing had been done .
delicious ! also received sample cocktails from sonya ( or sonia ) , which were also good and awesome to discuss what we liked about them .
i 'm sure we could 've dipped out without paying our bill and he would n't have a clue ... haha .
we both liked the tataki roll , and the other rolls were good , but nothing to throw a hoopla over .
the glass was filled with all ice and the drink was definitely watered down .
overpriced . seriously , $ 30+ for 2 small poutines and a can of soda is insane for montreal .
the only complaint was the ravioli was undercooked , not al dente like it should be .
the house wine , large beers , sake bombs , soju toni , large beers , and well drinks are all on happy hour .
- yes , the bathroom looks like something out of the scariest of scary movies .
love that eric at the bar !
brightly lit interior with modern lights and lots of natural light , this coffee shop provides a nice spot to spend some time .
the place was n't busy , so i 'm not sure why she had n't came by the table more than that one time , which never gave me a chance to tell her the order was wrong , so i had to pick out the things i had asked to be held from the order .
they did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it 's not all about crappy beer .
great food for the price of $ 4.95 .
i will admit this is not my favorite pizza place in the phx metro area ... but that 's the fun in finding new spots .
food : the price of the dishes are n't expensive , but the portion size you get i feel should be closer to three $ $ $ .
my family was just in there and waited over 20 min and nobody came to our table even once when it was not busy at all and the section we sat in was almost empty . horrible crappy non existant service .
food is awesome and price is reasonable .
the energy in the room was fun and happy .
i enjoyed the live music , and the dark pub-like atmosphere .
all great ! reasonable prices too .
was drinking bottle beer so hard to not get that right .
although this time the pie to vanilla custard ratio was off and i felt like there was only a tiny sliver of pie in there .
for alcohol it is just wine and one kind of beer .
with a creative menu , delicious food , a cool , upscale atmosphere , and a party vibe at night it 's everything you could ever want .
they have a great wine / drink menu .
only had water to drink so can not comment on the drink or beer pours .
we start to talk with them and find out of the poor service they have received , also about the extended wait for their desserts to arrive .
the bosa nova and latin vibe 's are filling the air with incredible free music , no cover !
the beer was fine , and if i had known the dos equis was only 3 dollars a bottle i would have stuck with that rather than the negra modelo .
we got seated quickly but never got service . after 20 mins of waiting for any kind of service ( a hello ... glasses of water ... acknowledgment that we were sitting there ) we asked what we assume was a manager could we get service .
nothing epic at all - i was concerned that maybe it was going to be too much for lunch but i cold have eaten 3 of them . there was enough chicken on it for maybe 1 taco .
it was good , light , fruity .
it 's just awkward .
not unless someone else is paying , far too expensive .
udon soup was the worst , however great service . when i advised i did not like the udon i was offered a curry chicken not too bad not the best not the worst
food comes in decent portions but reasonably priced .
his amazing attitude , genuine nature , and friendly personality , make every trip here fantastic . he 's incredibly personal and really ensures that you have a pleasant time , both professionally and personally .
the waitstaff is very friendly and attentive .
it looks like a decent place for a date or to catch up with friends .
i was not as impressed with the happy hour drink specials .
service was pretty careless although fast .
it was a unique way to do the seating for brunch , but i enjoyed it .
not cheap but great food .
had nachos which were surprisingly meh . bar tap choice was kind of limited , and they did n't have all on tap .
the linens were neat , no ugly 90 's geometric pattern on the comforter , unfortunately it was on the curtains and on the carpet . the bathroom was small , but clean .
walking in , i felt a little intimidated by the overwhelming presence of stuff on the walls and trophies everywhere .
the wine list is lower quality but the food does n't beckon a higher quality wine offering so it 's reasonable .
there was n't much of a tap selection . also i do n't know if we picked 6 bad beers or if the taps were bad but none of the beers were good .
i came here on fight night and the manager was very rude .
we went on a wednesday and we 're told all wine bottles are 1/2 off , so we opted for the riesling , a very good choice . for an app we got the brie , again delicious !
the washrooms were also appalling ; dirty , no toilet paper , and obvious signs that people had had sex in one of the stalls .
it was delicious , and tasted just like the real thing .
i think everyone at our table had either wine or beer ( they have an ok beer selection , but nothing fancy , and only bottles ) .
prices are very reasonable .
i think the only time they did n't mess it up was when it was only my husband and i. regardless i do n't understand why it 's so difficult .
it was paired with a really good rosé champagne .
second , all the sides are huge and cost over five dollars each which is more expensive than a side for one person should be .
the lighting was pretty cool , though ( check out the pictures i snapped ) .
$ 5 and change good ?
loved their plum wine each time .
this place is pretty good ! i 've been there a few times and i really love there food .
most importantly their food is delicious .
beer selection was good , but a gastropub should have unique vessels for drinks . cider in a guinness pint glass is just ... .wrong .
love love the view from the top of the stratosphere hotel and casino .
i love the music they play .
there was something a bit texturally off . if i had to guess , i 'd say the chicken was a bit undercooked .
yes $ 35 for a plate but i 'll totally do it again !
pretty good food , fairly priced . atmosphere ok , nothing special but clean .
maybe because it 's very close to my work but also maybe because it 's very clean and the service is always friendly .
weak service , beer on tap was two things : warm and stale .
highly recommend coming here to eat !
pretty ok selection of beer bottles and draught which is what i was after .
shredded chicken , a tomato flavored broth with really no other flavors , kinda bland .
the only thing it should improve is the time to bring the food .
service excellent with smiles .
they have really great drinks . strong but still refreshing .
additionally , the draft beer was only slightly chilled .
service was excellent , though was not greeted by the manager as everyone said `` they were '' , he was too busy talking with his familiar customers .
but i was disappointed once when i walk in and she was off . the other server said in a joking manner .
portions here are huge .
do n't bother . the three draft beers our group tried were tasteless , even after we specified we prefer hoppy brews .
delicious . when we visited last spring break we stopped here for breakfast .
wine selection was fair as well .
he assured i would receive a full refund and i did not have to bring in the food .
the vibe of garage is awesome ... high ceilings , exposed brick , dark furniture , and an awesome fireplace .
nachos and no beer does not make me happy .
other highlights of our meal included the meatballs with pomegranate and chicken breast . both had a nice blend of creamy and tang to them .
good thing it is at a bar and i could get an ice cold draft beer .
sat at the bar , ordered a cold negro modelo - they only offer it on draft .
price wise , such a bargain ! great place .
and sometimes the lighting makes me feel like i 'm being interrogated ( it 's a little dark and creepy ) .
first of all , the $ 8 for $ 20 is a great deal .
it is cheap and filling .
beer selection was decent but not many light beers were available . drink menu was impressive .
it 's perfectly situated right by the capitol so you have a great view when you 're dining .
yelp says they do delivery , but i asked the guy when i was paying and he said they do n't ... boo = (
the most disappointing thing though was that i could n't taste the tequila in my margarita and when i ordered two more shots to add the bartender got offended . would never recommend
they have a take out special for a 16 '' for $ 7.95 one topping .
so the food was way below mediocre , and kind of odd at the same time .
no draft beer there but a nice cold bottle of corona .
i really enjoyed my visit to this restaurant .
this place is pretty cheap .
however , no beer menu . weird .
only thing was i know the lighting is for ambiance and what not but its hard to read the menu with the lights so dim .
then i got confused because i know it to be called penang which is what it used to be called .
the prices are reasonable as well .
and we will mark this once great place off our list of regulars .
had 25 ladies on the patio for happy hour , servers were wonderful , food was delicious ( as always ) and the weather ( which i think they asked for : ) ) was perfect !
i am a huge fan of their marinara pizza while my boyfriend swears by the margherita .
aside from the poor customer service .
the seafood is all flown in fresh and is delicious . the clam and seafood chowders are some of the best i 've ever had and the oysters are to die for .
there are certain items that are $ 5 .
unfortunately their seating is limited , so we also had to sit next to the bathrooms ... which was not a pleasant experience .
the whole thing just feels ... dirty .
i really liked the ambiance even the darkness because the table lighting was adequate to read the menu .
be warned , it gets expensive : ran about $ 85 for four people .
i normally do n't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature .
it 's small but it has outdoor seating on those nice weather days ... we 've had sweet and savory crepes and they are all light and delicious .
we only do wine and beer at the bar . ''
you know the experience wo n't be good , when you 've waited 30 minutes for you 're order and you 're waitress tells you how understaffed they are . the food is ok , just ca n't get pass the service .
first of all , they only have beer and wine , no liquor .
we were n't the only ones that walked out without service either !
price is very reasonable .
the setting is comfortable .
everything was tasty and i devoured it all ! the fish quality was excellent .
the only thing i have n't completely demolished was the strawberry pavlova .
i wish they had more unique topping offerings , but they have the basics !
i had two beers and the beer was cold .
be sure to stop by for the deliciousness !
good vibes , reasonable prices .
the people are really nice , the food fresh , the chicken outrageous and prices reasonable .
we had a wonderful & relaxing brunch here ! the atmosphere is really comfortable and i love the decor .
-_- prices are pretty good considering the area of toronto it 's in .
and may i add one thing to this ... .i am so tired of going into restaurants with sports playing on the tvs .
it 's also nice to support a local venue . great coffee .
the gyoza was excellent with a very generously sized portion .
rula bula also has a big patio , so on a nice night , it 's a perfect place to hang out .
it 's a big meal and it 's quite delicious and almost healthy ( depending on which salads you get ) .
really nothing special or extraordinary to afford it the $ 22 price tag .
maybe i got the wrong item , but the salad was one of the worst i ever had .
only negative would be that it 's not a lot of food for $ 13 , even at lunch .
i ordered the chicken california burro which is a staple whenever i visit and my husband had the variety sampler of the enchiladas !
come for happy hour where drinks are half off and order yourself a pitcher of sparkling sangria .
music just a tad loud , and front entrance hard to spot .
not only are they delicious , but completely reasonably priced at $ 3- $ 3.50 compared to other dessert shops in the vicinity charging $ 14 for a slice of cake .
appetizer , meal , drink , and an amazing soynami .
great service . affordable price .
a fun place with great music , but check out the head on this beer ... a little excessive ...
beer was good too and they even had drinks even if do n't drink beer .
like fluorescent lighting that casts ugly shadows across one 's face .
no draft beer , but a decent choice of cans and bottles .
i just love the food at this place .
the wait staff has always been more then helpful and makes the perfect food recommendations .
our server was experienced by 30 years she said and it showed .
each meal was about $ 10-15 , amazing for the quality .
the space is bright and open .
margaritas had no alcohol in them yet they were the `` special '' of the night .
oh ... the wine by the glass list is amazingly horrible .
ocotillo is a beautiful , modern restaurant with a great vibe .
the meat was excellent . the flan was great too !
i asked if she had a menu and she said no we just have the normal stuff .
it looks delicious and i plan to try it soon .
i had the thai sweet wings , just yes in my mouth .
the interior is very relaxing and there 's a perfect blend in the atmosphere here between romantic and family dining .
the girl serving us did n't seem to care when my friend was asking about a certain food item on the menu .
decent salads but could be a better size and quality for the price they 're charging .
price is pretty good too .
the potato salad how ever was really amazing .
i feel like they have to compensate for the loss of business because they 're food is n't that great by upping the price of their product .
beer - the beer selection was nothing special and they do n't serve it in a cold glass .
great food and drinks .
it is a beautiful shop and i am always glad to see how busy they are , lets me know they 'll be around a long time !
they 're not high , per se .
the only reason this is not 1 star is because management was super cool .
for three of us at lunch eating moderately was just outrageous price wise .
it 's sort of a bizarre set up .
service was great ! the hostess tammie was super informative and friendly .
the interior is very dark though - my mom had to use the flashlight on her phone to read the menu .
entrees arrived with a full inch of grease pooled on the top and the sauces were gloppy and unappetizing .
perfect for the wine bar ambiance also .
no flavor and bland af .
my only complaint was the waitress was a complete moron .
i noticed tequila behind the bar but did n't see any beer and am unaware of what the happy hour entails .
horrible place ... sad to see this franchise has fallen so far . service is terrible + management indifferent .
anyway , great coffee and drinks and teas .
the restaurant has a really authentic feel and if i remember correctly , some nights they even have live music !
great food for an affordable price .
this place is a cool little joint , seems like it would be a great place to come eat and watch the tv .
horrible service , horrible food .
the restaurant bathroom is just plain dirty .
unfortunately they only have a few mixed drinks , beers , and wines - no full bar .
and the price for these two items and a pepsi -- $ 18 plus tip . pretty steep !
whole fish ceviche very good as well .
staff is nice and the prices are reasonable .
the other reviews do not lie : totally feels like a speakeasy .
it 's a shame the people were so rude , i 'm sure the food would 've been great but unfortunately we wo n't be coming back due to the long wait time and rude people .
food is good and variety on the menu .
this is the hottest , most tender , delicious cheese steak ever .
beer menu is severely limited with only one or two decent beers not made by budweiser .
really enjoyed it there . will be back for sure .
the butter chicken was n't and did n't even look like butter chicken and tasted more like a curry dish .
prices are reasonable for the place .
always number one in my book ! great service and wonderful coffee !
food was delicious and reasonably priced .
it 's very tasty and fresh . for $ 3.25 it 's a great lunch .
we where a party of 4. however i never got to try anything because we where told they where only open for take out .
they have a decent selection of beer , sake , cocktails and my favorite is the lychee martini .
the staff are all super friendly .
we also highly recommend eating on the patio , as it is huge and roomy !
very pretty atmosphere , beautiful outside seating .
service was fantastic , lobster bisque was creamy and delicious , and the ny strip melted in my mouth . highly recommended !
the waiter was very accommodating and was especially very attentive to our drinks -- both non-alcoholic and alcoholic .
it was very bland and the soup was thick and reminded me more of marinara sauce .
very friendly & efficient staff .
not too crazy over five guys . $ 9 for a small burger i do n't know .
they have a good tequila list though i was n't drinking tonight .
service was incredibly fast and friendly .
the sushi was mediocre .
i was very surprised !
so you pay $ 21 for chicken parm or $ 25 with added pasta . then add $ 6 for a salad .
the prices are excellent .
highly recommended , its a great dining experience !
tables are low lit and enclosed by a curtain for ultimate privacy .
i 'm pretty hard to gross out , but this place is nasty .
the food was good and the space was comfortable .
we started with martinis , $ 16 each and not even close to a full martini glass .
service is awesome and everyone was very friendly .
unfortunately we got seated at the bar and we were told we had to wait around 15 more minutes if we wanted a table . we were both hungry and did n't want to wait longer .
on the bright side the place is cool with great decor .
do n't bother with dollar margarita tuesdays . they 're so syrupy it 's impossible to drink an entire glass .
it 's just a artificial crime scene , a few framed descriptions and computers .
very scary that our to go order was ready in 5 minutes ... which says that they pre-cook everything early and slap stuff together when someone orders it .
also the spicy rice thing was so salty i 'm pretty sure it was just all msg .
finally , the interior lighting is a bit odd .
it has a cozy dining area that was easily able to seat our party of five .
nothing special . ok for a couple beers .
it 's great for a business lunch , or a nice dinner .
it 's sketchy as fuck .
after confirming i was calling the right place , i told him i needed to place an order for a cake .
coming on a weekday , dinner prices were almost $ 26 plus tax and tips , talk about expensive for hot pot .
it was disgusting and i kind of freaked myself out that i was going to get salmonella poisoning and die . luckily , that did n't happen .
i went with the pineapple cider . such a refreshing different taste .
they have a good beer selection but unfortunately the beers we ordered were flat .
pretty good wine selection i guess , i 'm not a wine guy . not much of a beer selection for being a beer and wine bar .
the prices are reasonable .
the decor is hipsterish in an unkempt way and bathrooms were atrocious ... .
did n't feel uncomfortable and parking was plentiful and good lighting .
i was forced to order something else despite the fact that i went there just for their hainan chicken rice .
this would run $ 35 if it were on the strip but is only $ 5.99 with the players card which is very quick to get if you do n't already have one .
the price is right and the london themed decor was nice !
their beer is pretty good and very reasonably priced and there is almost always some sort of special going on .
the chicken is gross - it tastes like some frozen pieces of chicken that are premade , thawed and then put in the burritos .
and the incredibly refreshing lemonade . everything was pitch perfect .
the cocktails were great also .
unfortunately they only have a few mixed drinks , beers , and wines - no full bar .
it 's in the ghetto and feels ghetto but it 's amazing ! so do n't let the looks put you off .
i was in the neighborhood at lunch time , and had heard good things from a couple of friends , so i thought i would give metro diner a try .
$ 23 dollars for a burger for me should be crazy good .
also , the sommelier made an excellent wine suggestion that was reasonably priced .
the duck confit ravioli was not bad , but it was really kind of a just okay flavor -- heavy and not that interesting of a cream sauce .
our waitress was nice , but i needed a refill of my water and never got one .
of course they are known for their great wine selection but since we are both beer drinkers we split a pitcher and board of bruschetta and were happy as could be .
the margaritas were so weak i 'm not sure they even had tequila .
service at the bar was atrocious . girls spent more time strutting back and forth ( nice , but not when you are waiting to order food ) behind the bar .
there was a wait and this place is pretty popular !
very friendly and personable .
thank you to bww and sam for making my son 's birthday experience a great one .
good , fast , cheap .
reasonably priced at 20 $ came with a show .
nothing special , taste like any other sandwich , soup , salad ... i had a piece of my co-worker eggplant parmigiana and it was oily but tasted pretty good .
too bad no beer though .
only suggestion would be to expand on wines by the glass !
this was refreshing and reminded me of a mojito .
excellent spicy salsa ! love the ceviche appetizer and seafood entrees too .
only negative , not many beers on tap , we ordered three times before we got a beer listed that they actually had on tap : (
the explanation in the little `` true food '' book about the decor and the feng shui was a little pretentious , but whatever .
needless to say , i wo n't be returning .
i saw some liquor bottles but did n't focus long enough to say whether they have a decent selection of tequila or not .
the decor seems to be somewhat childish .
stopped by couple weeks ago did n't realize they 're open on sundays which is awesome cause i was happy that i can get my post workout fix here .
so far waited 30 minutes and no drinks just sitting here with water one waitress four tables.. got our cucumber salads at 35 minutes.. soup came after our rolls .
terrible service , terrible management .
we came during happy hour so we ordered a bottle of wine which was half off !
and for $ 27 ( including tax and tip ) , it 's a pretty expensive burger .
the entrance itself has a secret entrance and was of course packed .
staff were so kind and atmosphere was friendly .
beers were good ( even though they didnt have any beer specials ) ... hmmmm .
the chips were not warm or crispy and the salsa was thin , soupy and tasteless . not a good start .
the tempura ( i get it 's already pre-made ) was cold . i wished it was made to order .
the pizza is pretty good too .
it was extremely oily and lacked so much flavor .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
they have the menu decently priced .
thank you for been so nice with my boys .
the lighting can be a little awkward when trying to read the menus , but impossible , it is not .
reasonable prices and good service
this place is amazing ! i was in town visiting and wanted boba .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
also worth noting , you never hear any pedestrian traffic . no weird mall conversations to ruin the atmosphere .
regardless , this is n't a bad place to grab a quick bite .
their sangria was excellent along with their blueberry bliss cocktail .
i had a glass of wine and the chicken sandwich .
we had a reservation and the place was empty so not sure why we got that table .
this bar has a fantastic vibe .
had the garlic chicken for an app- it was cooked perfectly , with a little warmth balanced from the sweet sauce ; larger than i expected , definitely no problem sharing .
family owned and always kept clean . highly recommended
they also have comfy booths and a nice relaxing atmosphere .
i found that having ripped wallpaper in the halls and the design around the room outdated .
service - we had some great advice at the bar on the different margarita options and enjoyed the education .
it was sad watching them prepare my soup from a bag and heating it .
honestly i 'd rather pay $ 50 more a night and stay at a nicer , better smelling hotel .
this is a great place to swing by for lunch .
i work near here and service is always fast and friendly . food is always hot and that makes me pretty happy when im really hungry .
the dessert portions are huge !
i do n't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine .
dry , flavorless , chicken , potato cake that it was served on was mushy , garlic green beans were too salty .
it 's not cheap and the dish prices do begin to add up as you are ordering , but beer and drinks are very reasonably priced .
when we got our food , the sliders were supposed to be pork ( which i order a lot , so i know what it tastes like ) , but my husband and i are positive it was not pork .
not sure how much it is walking in without coupon but i 'm sure it 's not worth it unless it 's $ 10- $ 15 .
the service was great , even though according to our waitress they were short staffed .
the average : i was n't crazy with the tomato based sauce on the paella .
everything was so delicious ! we also had some grapefruit and citron soju .
had a really great dinner here for valentines .
everyone loved em on our recent trip .
beer was just not good .
the uniforms were stylish , sort of a boris and natasha kinda thing .
- steak teriyaki . similar where the meat was very tough , the rice came overcooked and soggy and sopping in sauce and again , most of the veggies were unevenly chopped and were still raw .
mind you , these were two draft beers , one bottle , and a glass of wine and there was only one patron sitting at the bar .
leon is amazing , bre is wonderful , i love coming in to see them .
they also never checked on us , so she never ate her salad . : - ( she never asked if i wanted another drink when i finished mine , and it took us time to get the check .
the drinks are splendid .
it is no loud i do n't think there is any insulation in the walls . the room is dirty i know they did n't clean the mirror has stuff all over it .
their happy hour is awesome and they have a great tequila selection .
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
the atmosphere was outstanding - quiet , quaint and relaxing . the service was great as well .
service was pretty slow considering there was one other table of two sitting there waiting .
paying $ 14 for what i received made my wallet very sad .
there is a great wine list , and cocktails too .
nice ambiance with a view of the canal . friendly service and okay food .
when we arrived there were maybe 4 or 5 tables so i thought service would be good .
we certainly wo n't be returning nor recommending this place .
the lighting is kind of poor , but that adds to the charm .
the chairs are comfortable , the atmosphere is quiet and intimate , and the service is great !
the atmosphere looks really nice .
they have really good quality meats , not the tough stuff you have to chew over and over on just to be able to swallow it .
not only was this experience super disappointing , but so was the food . bland .
they put the dark side facing down but it was obvious . the calamari are the long cuts that look like chicken fries and there are not tentacle pieces , just blah on the flavor .
love the location and layout of the place . really great patio area and its dog friendly .
when we got there , i did n't realize the lighting was super bright with funky light colors .
the beer is good and very reasonable priced .
the place seemed nice , but i do n't understand the whole dim lighting thing in restaurants .
staff were friendly and attentive .
it 's not cheap for sure , and their takeaway bags probably cost $ 10 alone !
they do have a full bar but no beer on tap .
and the staff could n't possibly have treated us better .
tasteless hotdogs , roasted til it and the bacon around it shriveled . mushy , tasteless bun .
the prices here are also very reasonable .
price are really good .
i have experienced better . ( insert farting noise here )
the only plus to my meal was the garlic feta fries .
also , the prices are not that great .
the pork slider was just horrible & full of just fat instead of any meat .
for quality of food reasonably priced .
the atmosphere is different for sure ... cosmic dave ... i get it now : ) sandwiches have two choices for bread ... white or wheat ... .it is sooo yummy too .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
we had a great dinner here .
they have very inventive rolls- upper manhattan roll was awesome !
our server was really friendly and attentive .
they also have fresh squeezed lemonade that contributed to making my arnold palmer with their sweet tea .
i 'd this awful food is the impression cleveland is giving visitors , cleveland should be ashamed of itself .
total for everything was about $ 8.50 .
for a modern , non-authentic mexican joint , it 's pretty good ! priced pretty cheap .
the waitress is super sweet , sushi chefs are friendly , food is excellent .
very sweet and the price is very outrageous .
it 's not the greatest nor is it terrible . it 's a decent buffet .
crazy cheap and top quality .
the beef was kinda hard to chew , soup was not flavored right ( very bland taste , plus there 's a hint of vinegar in the soup ) , and noodle was definitely way too soft . fried chicken was okay , but a little bit over cooked .
wow great food ! we sat outside in the patio the waiter juan was so great and amazing service he was super nice and helpful i would definitely recommended coming here again
the lychee drink tasted great . tasted like lychee and the drink did n't taste strong but gave me a good little buzz .
i got the smothered chicken . crispy on the outside and moist on the inside and the gravy had a nice peppery kick .
heart attack roll and spicy garlic edamame is my favorite .
check out casella 's i 'm sure they 'll make you a fan .
only reviewing the drinks here- expensive and the margarita tasted like there was n't any tequila in it .
if i can walk right in , then i 'm definitely a fan .
i 've been waiting for months for this location to open and it 's great , i just hope they change their mind on their hours !
sitting outside in the beer garden is a perfect thing to do on warm evenings !
$ 10.99 for shawarma was a bit on the pricy side but i would rather pay a bit more and get quality than to pay a bit less and not be happy with my meal .
the prices are reasonable , but not like dirt cheap or anything , especially for the pasta .
the way the painful fluorescent lighting reflects off the bright yellow walls is almost genius in its awfulness .
price wise , for vegas it was average ; chips/salsa was $ 5 and a pitcher of house margaritas was $ 30 .
the free wine & beer was a plus and the desserts were phenomenal !
really ? maybe management is terrible and everyone is unhappy and it 's showing on the floor ?
mens bathroom apparently was a nightmare ( took away a star ) vomit in sink , urine and feces on floor : / womens bathroom was fine .
plus the smallest number of wings you can order is 7 which is kind of ridiculous .
the price is reasonable .
the grounds around the restaurant are amazing .
while the prices are high i believe i get good value for my money .
this was boyfriend and i first time going to kabuki and i was really excited we never get a chance to go out together and just enjoy the night since we both work evenings .
the bartender also recommended a good sparkling chardonnay which was not too sweet but not too dry .
at about $ 4 per skewer and $ 8 for a larger dish you can easily drop $ 30 bucks here and still be able to eat more , but then again , i do n't think you get these dishes anywhere else in town .
we stood at the hostess stand for 5+ minutes , before finally grabbing one of the very busy waitresses who ended up seating us .
instead we enjoyed a glass of wine ( riesling for me ) , a bowl of gazpacho and shared the snapper ceviche .
the waitress was extremely rude stating there was no way to get refunded ( even though i had n't received my food ) and refused to refund the trans .
my comrades had some lovely manhattans and i had a one night stand which was fruity and delicious .
they were only good for light beer even thought they said any domestic beer .
this place is by far my guilty pleasure .
they only had 5 beers on tap , which i thought was sort of odd .
unfortunately they only have a few mixed drinks , beers , and wines - no full bar .
my favorite greek restaurant is back at a new location on o'connor dr. near st. clair . same great food , great looking new location , very nice looking place , good job .
the food items are all over $ 10 ( many of the finer dishes are $ 20+ ) so do n't expect a cheap dine in session at all .
i decided on a glass of wine , which turns out to be my new favorite wine .
i went for the unlimited champagne brunch , which cost about $ 30 - only $ 6 more than the regular brunch .
unfortunately it was cold !
prices are high , but i guess normal for vegas .
i loved the light decor and the ambience .
in a korean restaurant , where rice is served in metal bowls , where did this broken piece of sharp object come from ?
do n't go here i found a nasty gum wrapper with gum cooked with the vegetables and it looked like cabbage . disgusting .
their food always tastes homemade and the omelets are fantastic . i would definitely recommend the biscuits and gravy as well .
the waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were .
they were just awful and i do not think the tequila was patron .
prices are also reasonable which is a plus !
we tried the bruschetta which was perfect for two people . we asked the bartender to pair our app with some drinks and he did a great job with the sorry , not sorry and a glass of moscato .
this place is authentic and delicious and pretty reasonably priced .
all in all a fantastic visit .
sandwiches are fresh and generous , place is clean , pizza is delicious .
i had a greek salad which was amazing , brussels sprouts ( i do n't eat brussels sprouts but ) these were amazing !
i like all the flavors but my favorites are the custard filled and the blueberry .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
do not pay the outrageous covers .
inside was very clean and though minimal decor , a large mural spanning two inside walls gave the place some personality .
not very pretty or appetizing .
the food is quick and quality and the prices are fair .
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
we had a lovely dinner here new year 's eve .
i took a look at the beer list and was pretty impressed , as they had at least fifteen different beers on tap , plus i think that they had a bottled beer list as well .
beer and wine was unlimited , but they were serving only one type of beer .
their drink prices were ridiculous ( $ 11.99 for a mudslide , for example ) .
unfortunately , their rice is also served very dry , which does a good job of absorbing what little sauce there is left with your meal .
also - the bartender - brandon ( i think ) was awesome !
the building is fabulous and the bar is great too .
the drinks were also very creative and just the type i like ( lavender martinis , cucumber cocktails , etc ) .
and the plum wine is delicious .
truly a great place to eat , we 've been there often and have always enjoyed the food and service .
very hard to eat , the taste was ok , but it was not what i expected .
$ 4.99 was expensive for what you got .
and please ask for the pomegranate martini . for dessert i suggest you drink your calories with the chocolate martini , the most beautiful drink on the menu .
the bright fluorescent lights indicate they have nothing to hide . the pho is incredible .
the whole set up is kind of awkward .
a bit on the loud side if you wan na chat but food and drinks are excellent .
i like chatting with the people that work there and they 're always very friendly .
the walls are brightly colored , which i enjoyed a lot , but along one side was a series of illustrations depicting ... a person ?
the decor was kind of odd .
not very good anymore . the food was too salty , the green beans were so tough , and the potatoes tasted fake .
the burgers are good and you can order a $ 380 bottle of wine with your $ 10 burger if you choose .
only flaw is the price ... i think the prices are a bit over charged .
the soups are awesome too .
i really do n't think there is a bad option here . the prices can get up there depending on what you get but in general the items range from $ 9-15 which i would say is n't absurd .
a little expensive for its class ... .
they have a huge cocktail menu !
for about $ 14 , it was pretty worth the price .
i would say its a little tacky but clean .
yes its a bit steep at $ 12.00 for just a sandwich but it does come with a whole pickle and small serving of slaw so throw in a bottle of water and you are not far north of the cost for a `` meal '' from chick-fil-a .
they would n't have it , not even a i 'm sorry . a good customer service manager would have worked something out like maybe i could fit you in tomorrow or something but that did n't happen .
they did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it 's not all about crappy beer .
so , i really liked it that the cookies did n't get soggy and the boba did n't freeze .
great food and reasonable prices .
what a deal , cheap but delicious eats .
everything is super reasonably priced too , 8-10 $ for dishes with meat .
plus their decor is really nice and homey which is a plus for me .
price wise it may be a bit more expensive but the portions you get are huge .
disappointing for the price , it was expensive .
great food at reasonable prices .
the staff was outstanding .
the problem with moving , in my mind , is becoming accustomed to your new side of town , even in such a smaller place like las vegas .
ordered a blackberry lemonade -perfect , not too strong .
30 minutes for food in an empty restaurant and waitresses that just dont give a crap about women who come to eat .
it always has an elegant , classy look to it .
also it was pretty annoying that i had to keep asking my waitress for more water despite being the only people in the small restaurant .
another average tasting burger place . i regret paying $ 10 for an ok and tiny burger when i can get a delicious and cheaper one from other places .
no need to keep rushing me . if i ever come again will make sure not to sit in her section .
also you can not stay more than an hour , even though i would n't willingly stay more than 5 mins .
the food is good and the prices are fair .
greco makes their own pork gyro which is the tastiest gyro i have ever eaten .
we loved the atmosphere inside . everything is very modern and fresh .
finally they brought bread and apologized for it taking so long . when it was time to bring the dinner plate , we asked for more bread .
the environment is perfect .
pour was perfect for me and my wife to split for each course .
the restaurant itself is pretty minimal , big paint words like smash and burger all over the walls .
pricing is a little high but not unreasonable .
my favorite was the seasonal moscow mule . it had spiced apple cider , vodka , lime juice , and ginger beer -- the perfect combination !
disappointed they did n't have liquor but only wine or beer - had to order sangria .
definitely one of my favorite spots in town to sip on wine and take in the scenery while enjoying a mimosa on the patio .
drinks were a little weak but draft beers worked well enough .
i love the rum runner on the rocks .
i 've never heard any atmospheric music being played , the carpet is ugly , the furniture is boring and dark , and there is no privacy offered by the interior design .
i like to have a fair bit of water ( and wine ! )
nice and fresh and reasonably priced .
it is a fun restaurant with slightly challenging parking but that is to be expected in that area .
not only was the food superb - potato soup and blt for hubby , tuscan kale salad for me - but the personality of the staff made you feel so wanted !
food was delicious , great restaurant and incredibly friendly staff . could n't recommend more highly !
the breading was `` powdery '' and had a really weird taste to them .
great service at this location too !
wow . walked in for the first time , after i tentatively asked for a tune sandwich the gentleman asked me if i had been there before , i told him no so he said he would give me a `` tour '' .
the service was also very good ... server was super friendly and attentive and everything came out quickly .
so many great restaurants within walking distance and for some reason we decide on this one .
the host was sort of rude , but the hostesses were nice and our server did a great job .
i usually get a brisket , cheesy potatoes , and beans- all are very flavorful .
cute little venue with a very cozy vibe . nice decor .
ambiance kind of sucks .
prices are good too .
in terms of the fried noodles and rice , the prices are very reasonable , ranging from $ 5- $ 7 , and you will not be disappointed , they are absolutely amazing .
i kept thinking , `` does my nose look shiny ? '' ( the things you think about in poor lighting ) .
it was also reasonably priced .
we went for lunch and both the sushi and sashimi specials were excellent . nice selection of fish that started with miso soup and a salad .
not sure why people rave about the margaritas , i think they either have no tequila , or it 's severly watered down .
of course they are expensive ; probably average $ 3- $ 4 each .
the problem here is that they have cranked up their own music outside , which conflicts with the music played by the mall .
please do n't disappoint ! i think this could be a new favorite !
very strong drinks , we all know i 'm a fan of that : ) i just had to try the lemoncello margarita , i mean come on ... awesome idea !
the bathroom was actually scary and dark .
they had a good wine selection too , and a bunch of them were on the happy hour deal , two glasses for the price of one .
everything was super white and shiny with marble tables ... so it kind of felt like i was in a washroom .
we had a great experience at dc steak house !
i was so worried about coming here because of the bad reviews regarding the customer service .
i 've had almost everything on the menu and my favorites are chicken and beef shawarma combo plate .
the food and drink were excellent .
they happily swapped me out for the coconut mojito which was amazing !
i also enjoyed the unique art from local artists that decorate the walls ; gives a unique vibe to the place .
$ 3.99 for a huge plate that could easily be an appetizer for 5 people .
they got my order wrong and it was n't even busy .
unfortunately the poor service ruined what would have been a restaurant i would suggest friends go to .
since when does $ 12 cover the cost of two free meals from noodles and company ?
make sure to grab a couch seat .
my date had a drink whimsically named strawberry field ( strawberry mimosa ) which was lovely .
visit during happy hour to get great deals on drinks and food .
the dining room itself had the potential to be cool , but instead felt cluttered .
the bread came out cold with cold butter that would n't spread . my frittata also came out fairly cold and it was tiny .
i liked the food and the drink was refreshing .
the staff was very friendly and took great care of us !
wow new fav place to eat in brampton .
beer choices were weak , wine choices were fine .
service was very good , wait staff friendly .
the cocktail sauce was so bland .
this whole unpleasant experience could have easily been avoided if the manager was nice and explained the situation and their policies properly instead of being a b. also , the baby chairs they have are extremely unsafe as they do not have any straps to hold the child in .
but the food was just ok. mostly frozen items deep fried and served with sauces . the wings were pretty good though .
the portions are generous and perfectly prepared . the kebabs are delicious and the rice is to die for !
i have never experienced such disrespect before .
they have a pretty good beer list , though nothing on draft .
they have a full bar with beers on tap with no drink or beer menu ?
the drinks were n't `` weak '' !
the price was reasonable considering the massive selection .
i like the weird , cheap feel of the decor because it sends snooty people away .
i know toronto is expensive but $ 50 a head with no booze and only two starters and two desserts was a bit much .
the beer was cold and in a pint glass .
at least the beer was decent .
price is very good as well , i got their $ 8 lunch special .
after the girl took our money she said `` ok have a great day ! '' i looked at her confused and said `` can i have my dessert ? ''
the drinks were pretty good , i got a paloma and my boyfriend had a coconut margarita .
casual but with nice character .
i liked the casual feel and the picnic tables .
fed and filled 6 hungry people for around $ 60 total -- such a relief from the other overpriced and bland food on the strip .
unfortunately besides for the body mirror in the restroom there is n't a body mirror in the room itself .
all wonderful . the paella also had excellent flavor .
tldr : not bad for take out lunch food ( around $ 8- $ 12 ) .
this soup packed a bunch of flavor and is perfect for dipping the sourdough bread it 's served with .
great value for the price .
every day they have certain specials with something for $ 4 , $ 3 , $ 2 , $ 1 .
very bland , very starchy burrito . the meat is plain and the rice overcooked , and there 's little in the way of interesting herbs , sauces , or salsa to liven it up .
final note , they need to drop the prices on everything by about $ 5 .
it wasnt terrible and was definitely edible .
very expensive and worth it .
food is just terrific - we love the guacamole selection , and the machaca beef is amazing . everything is quality and exceedingly fresh .
drinks were awesome as well .
the food is excellent and priced fair .
this was a little irritating as she did n't even bother to tell me until i asked her about it .
the chicken apple had a nice contrast of flavors and textures and was surprisingly spicy , which i enjoyed .
veggies are tasteless as well .
beer selection was weak as well , and their bottle menu was inaccurate .
the price is also very fair .
we got there just in time for happy hour , so i was able to snag a house martini for $ 5 .
the staff are friendly and fast ! they also have great prices on the regular rolls and the cucumber avocado roll is a favorite if the vegans in the family .
i actually prefer it cold better than warm . the corn pudding is fine but lacked flavor in my opinion .
ambiance is okay but acoustics are n't great- loud .
friendly service , reasonable value , decent food - wo n't wow you but holds its own . best value is the all day breakfast for 5.99 between 7 and 11 .
the staff is friendly and the food is great .
the decor of the rooms were beautiful , modern and classy .
not most expensive , but higher than average .
the margaritas and sangrias were a great compliment to a warm spring day .
restaurant is located inside the hotel . kind of noisy .
so many of our friends belong as well and we have met so many great people here as well that we have become friends with .
they had about 15 beers on tap and they were pretty impressive .
not only now it taste yucky , it also looks absolutely disgusting .
craft beers were about 5-6 which is n't too bad .
we did n't try any cocktails , but the beer selection was n't too bad .
greasy tables and mediocre eats . not impressed .
the whole thing just feels ... dirty .
it is not expensive either .
not bad , but the wait was fairly long , given the number of people in the restaurant .
beer selection was horrible ( typical of canada ) and on top of that they were out of the one beer that 's barely drinkable . wine selection was nearly as bad .
nothing fancy , though , and the walls and carpeting in the hallways were especially worn and in need of replacement .
$ 17 for just the roll only but i will gladly pay for it .
the atmosphere was also horrible . the lighting was insufficient , and place just looked pretty outdated .
mine was $ 12 on its own .
also , the veggie platter is yum , full of flavor and variety
the teriyaki is a bit strong but the chicken is very tender and plentiful .
the sheer volume from people talking is so loud that it is nearly impossible to hold a conversation without some sort of signing .
you pay a premium for the nice ambience .
the place is awesome . great food each time , excellent cocktails and wine selection as well .
best resto ever : ) this chef is a genius ! portions are a bit small but made with huge heart .
the place is n't cheap , you ca n't get out of there with two medium portioned breakfasts and two drinks for under $ 40 .
if a $ 20 plus tip martini is your idea of a good time , this is your place . the food is like a medium burger place with premium prices .
for $ 35 after tax for three people it 's an excellent value and i 'll return very soon .
the only reason for the 4 stars was because of the `` corny '' attire for the waitresses ... but some guys like the school girl look ( short plaid skirts ) .
i absolutely love the bar . the bartenders are attentive and crafty with the cocktails .
i highly recommend any of their salads and the pastas .
the place can get packed during the lunch and breakfast rush so try to hit them up in between if you can . you will walk away one happy camper i guarantee !
although do find it really weird to see one of my hindu gods displayed in a venue filled with drunk scantily clad people .
had the evil jungle princess , it was freaking awesome . hubbie had something with beef and green beans , awesome too , but could not steal my heart from the jungle princess .
food was excellent , and the service just as good . queso dip was fresh and yummy and the enchiladas were authentic .
after visiting first friday for the time , my friends and i wanted to try a delicious restaurant close by .
the menu looked good , we thought the beer selection was good , especially having 12 draft beers .
$ 12 for the combo , not bad for all that you get .
i was also totally weirded out that the bathroom had mirrored walls .
his came with rice as well as broccoli ... the broccoli was just normal broccoli but the rice , he said the rice tasted like microwave uncle bens .
the lights gave the place an uncomfortable feel .
it 's just a short walk away and it a lovely little oasis .
the mojito 's were made different every time we ordered one .
really a good deal for the price we paid .
the meal itself was reasonably priced , so it 's a great value , too !
the decor is nothing fancy , but this place is certainly unique .
i probably will only return here if i 'm super hungry for chinese late at night since they open till 2am .
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
our server , robert was very nice .
another plus , you can get a decent bottle of wine for about $ 20 .
it 's always very good quality of fresh food !
i 'd definitely recommend coming here for a good time when you 're in the mood for some steak .
mind you , these were two draft beers , one bottle , and a glass of wine and there was only one patron sitting at the bar .
food is good , meat is tender . prices are $ $ .
.. see familiar faces and three wonderful bar tenders who are attentive , and kind and have been here long enough to consider them family .
the quality is great but it is airport priced .
there is quite a variety of drinks for happy hour .
i did n't like the concept of having to order at the counter because i did n't like having to make my decision of what to order under pressure , as there was a line forming behind us .
beers were not even close to full and wine poor was average .
the drinks we ordered were very strong as well .
they have nice wine selection .
it 's set in a sports bar , which is cool to have tvs to watch while dining .
the price was way too high .
in the bathroom mirror but i digress ... .. the trump hotel stays true to being a hotel and not a casino , which is a plus , you wont come out of the ridiculously fast elevators to the barrage of smoke and background casino noise . two words : jacuzzi tub
the person was n't annoying just the theme park feel of that .
yesterday beer battered shrimp and crab pita was ridiculously delicious . never disappointed with the food and beer .
the traditional sides are a wonderful compliment with perfectly cooked rice n peas , cabbage , and plantains . irie also has amazing peppered shrimp , patties , and curry .
the wine selection was awesome !
with thirty some craft beers and wines on tap , beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender .
it 's fun and you can watch a game with nice people .
he 's chilling with the patrons when ever it 's not too crowded .
i was a bit disappointed that they did n't have draught beer but enjoyed the selection of cans and bottles .
for a popular restaurant they should know how to plan ahead .
ray cures the salmon himself and it is so well done . paired with the great ciabatta bread and toppings - you ca n't beat it .
chicken souvlaki with rice and salad is our regular choice .
could not believe the price ... so fantastic ... 2 bucks per a beer ...
the only reason i knocked off a star was because i ordered my meal without garlic anywhere due the allergy and my steak came out with the chimi sauce on it , which does in fact contain fresh garlic .
the patio is awesome too ... we need more patio dining options around town .
i 've been wanting to try elly 's since moving to this area , and we finally had a chance to go a few weeks ago !
for the price , its not bad .
ambiance is nice , but food just ok. waitress was very rude .
fast service , reasonable prices , good selection .
nothing special . ok for a couple beers .
the prices ? reasonable .
prices are fair too for such good quality food .
great food horrible service . they need to give the young kid some customer service skills he sucks .
the decor and styling of the restaurant is great . i loved the paintings and lighting throughout .
delicious food and a huge selection of beer and wine .
again , not salty but good consistency taste .
the sauce was gloppy and bland . i 'm a sucker for general tso 's tofu , and was disappointed with the sauce .
the inside was super clean . the cashier was very friendly .
glad they have reopened and now in village square . service is outstanding .
the dish did seem a little overcooked as it was a bit dry . but , a decent dish nonetheless .
the food is good but significantly over priced .
kind of weird , and not really fitting .
what can i say ... always fabulous , every time we get off the plane , whether i 'm with my mom , my boyfriend , my friends , does n't matter ... this is where we come first !
most of the mussels on the bowl were either empty or dry and stale .
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
everyone was so attentive .
as far as being expensive , it 's only a few dollars more per roll than the grocery store charges .
: ) the price varies , but you can get a healthy , decent , and filling meal for 10.00 and under .
there 's just something that tasted really weird about the glaze that they used .
the decor was kind of odd .
the aburi sushi was okay ... it tasted great but the pieces of fish were quite thin . the shrimp tempura in the cooked foods plate was delicious .
the margarita was n't anything special either .
good wine list and great deserts .
went here for a late night snack .
it was very frustrating , not to mention , the food was bland and had zero presentation .
i totally love this location .
i 'm in arizona for work and one of my coworkers brought me here bc she loved this chain when she lived in milwaukee .
it came as ordered but there was absolutely no meat at all in the salad so it was only beans , lettuce & cheese ?
she said it was absolutely delicious , and a truly unique vegetarian burrito .
i love the vibe of this place .
the meats are always fresh and the accompanying side dishes are delicious .
we tipped her 20 % because that 's what we always think is fair but believe you me , it crossed my mind not to .
we had the veggie pho dish and tofu scrambled main course . the pho dish was awesome !
it 's great to get into the city and the atmosphere is also wonderful .
not sure if i 'll try it again !
the decor is horrible , lol , but i do n't come here to look at walls .
the men 's bathroom had piss all over the floor and smelled disgusting .
they 're reasonably priced and service is quick .
the side cesar salad i ended up ordering with my steak was $ 7 , and was pretty lackluster to be honest .
beer selection was weak as well , and their bottle menu was inaccurate .
the wine and beer was delicious and the food was phenomenal .
weird layout for what should be a fancy place .
the food : unfortunately , the food was lackluster at best .
burger was spicy , drink was strong , but refreshing .
both came with a salad , pasta and this unbelievably , amazing fresh baked bread .
the interior is not bad .
fancier but still reasonably priced . really enjoyed the food .
cheap , fast , great food for the price .
the bartender stopped serving us and after asking to speak to a manager nothing was resolved she said that she did n't feel comfortable serving us ... with no explanation we were told to leave ... racial prejudice from the bartender was appalling .
i do n't get the hype ! i had been hearing good recommendations for this restaurant and decided to try it for dinner .
i ordered the lunch special thai noodles but they do n't use the noodles i ate in other places it 's dry and thin . beef is over cooked
the food is very good quality and reasonably priced .
i found the decor slick and appealing , has kind of a velvet rope appeal without being too clubby feeling .
good quality , presentation , service , atmosphere , everything .
wife had food poisoning after eating most likely the seafood , maybe the mussels or possibly the chinese food since those were the only items i didnt have .
the restaurant itself is very nice , the atmosphere is n't very calm though but is n't unpleasant .
i had the pimm 's cup which i also really enjoyed .
and the fried brownies were amazing !
it 's reasonably priced .
ps the wine is included with the meal ; )
it is also reasonably priced .
for some reason i 'm not a big fan of the stained glass ceiling - it does weird things to the lighting and is distracting and i find it to be just the tiniest bit gaudy .
they now have shrimp and grits on their happy hour menu ... it melts in your mouth .
i also asked for a cocktail suggestion and the server sent out a cucumber vodka drink which was great .
and they start you off with bread and 3 delicious dips . so unexpected !
the only reason these guys are still in business is because of the cheap prices ( $ 15 for dinner ) .
it 's a beautiful scenic location . you can enjoy this as a date night or as a family picnic !
such a nice patio but the men are freezing so the misters are off so time to go .
ca n't believe this bad attitude and that they were willing to lose a $ 15.00 sale plus tax and tip because i wo n't buy a $ 2.00 that was n't part of the meal .
no full bar , only beer .
i love going after work and getting a martini and some appetizers .
i had the pleasure of stopping here for dinner on a recent trip to pittsburgh and i was very happy that i did .
i said i was not trying to get a free meal just trying to offer him some `` real '' feedback on how the food he was offering was from a customer 's perspective .
the nachos were the best nachos i have ever had with a nice smoky flavor !
we had to recap the bottles of wine and constantly keep the food fruit fly free .
do n't go late on a friday or saturday ; turns into a club at night with atrocious loud music and everyone is drinking coors light .
any time a server delivers your margarita with , `` i 'm a terrible bartender because i like drinking too much .
but over extremely over priced and insane .
nonetheless , the food is filling and the prices are reasonable .
i waited at the bar and had a happy hour scotch on the rocks .
siam noodles portion are so much smaller than before , also having a weird taste like unfresh ingredients !
it was nasty , i could 've honestly made that at home for $ 2 .
the only redeeming item was the ranch that came with them .
there is a patio and we enjoyed the weather before the tough az summer hits .
i love that it 's so close to the university because it gives it a different vibe than other postinos .
the waitress offered us the happy hour drink menu and i had a very good sangria .
i always start with the oyster and a good glass of wine wine b4 to order my diner
i paired the meal with a glass of riesling ( $ 11 ) , which could have been sweeter , in my opinion ( i love the really sweet wines ) , but it was still a nice wine .
the buns wasnt hot nor toasted , which i like .
we had mixed drinks that were perfect !
price wise , its a little pricey .
am glad to have found this place .
tried the thai coconut curry chicken and felt in love with it ! also ordered the mongolian beef , great taste and great portion !
very sad , since i spent $ 70 bucks on dinner .
the waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were .
finally , the interior lighting is a bit odd .
bad service from the hostess . she was rude and not friendly at all .
all three dishes were well prepared and delicious . the food arrived hot and timely .
minimalist interior , i mean seriously .
the prices are very affordable , especially their lunch specials .
think partially cooked , lukewarm veggies with a piece of hair . and dirty glasses with specs of food .
but we stayed , and knowing he was completely in the weeds did n't make a fuss and still tipped ... however the service was pretty bad since he had at least five tables with more people coming in after us .
the fried rice was okay as well , not the worst but not the best . bland .
a bit steep at $ 15 for a small piece , but it was really delicious .
when you walk in there 's all these flowers and it 's so bright and colorful , the uniforms are lame tho , they could do something about that pink housekeeper look .
( too bad i got take out ) the lighting is quite dim .
so what ; the food is good and the prices reasonable .
however , the crêpes themselves were underwhelming - pretty rubbery .
the pasta dishes were okay but nothing special .
for $ 3.50 it 's not too bad of a price , but their portions are reasonable .
it looked just like the picture and it tasted pretty good .
the chicken is moist and tender , salad tasty and fresh and the pitas are excellent .
i do n't see how this place is only $ $ $ with $ 88 entrees on the menu , but then i do n't think the $ $ $ range should be $ 30-60 .
i had two very delicious mojitos .
their prices are very good .
the wine by the glass from oregon ( pinot noir ) was pretty good .
we opted for the happy hour and everything was delicious - highly recommend the fish tacos and salt/pepper shrimp .
the staff who i think are all family were very kind and prompt .
the bar is really small . there is music but no dance floor to speak of and almost all the seating is outdoors ( it was well over 95 degrees that night ) and pretty much all of the seating indoors is reserved for bottle service .
the chips were made of something more like what i expected the pellini bread to be , but again were bland .
the bartender was nice ; cocktail was pretty darn good .
it came to around $ 10 including tax and the portions were huge , so quite good value for money .
the price was ridiculous $ 30 for a k are one topping and 16 wings but whatever we were hungry .
the pizza is really well made and delicious .
my only complaint is that the restaurant is so dark it makes reading the menus difficult ( they should offer flashlights or invest in backlit menus ) .
add a couple glasses of merlot on the patio with great service and the night was perfect .
the food was fantastic and the service was excellent . i had the dry aged sirloin with steak frites and the steak was perfect .
the wings were mushy and not hot at all . burger was odd tasting too .
packed at lunch . staff is nice and good is delicious !
we then called the front desk to ask when the music would end . guest services told us the music would stop at 4 a.m. then they became very rude and condescending .
40 dollars for 2 entrees , an app and 2 beers seems kind of steep .
my friend did the wine flight options and enjoyed all four wines .
we also ordered the sangria with wine , which was the worst sangria i 've ever had .
the prices were really reasonable , too .
they are insanely rude and would ignore you on purpose !
my only complain : the interior is ghetto old .
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
i did find that all the bright colors and decorations did a lot to brighten my mood at 3am .
sitting up there looking out over the city lights having some drinks was magical .
i gave four stars just because the special was way too $ $ $ for what we got .
shots , beer all good but i did not their food .
i love restaurants with inspiring stories and it 's been nice watching them kill it .
this fast food joint has a loyal californians cult following .
minor minuses : i did n't love the decor , i wanted it to be more dimly lit and more cozy some how .
their mojito was n't that great . it was too diluted .
music was great , we stayed till 2:30am but the head line dj still had not started playing .
the cost was reasonable too !
they house a very low key and chill restaurant and bar that also has some pool tables .
good eats at cheap prices .
great place for quick food in the strip .
i ordered the yellowtail lover and dang was it good . i thoroughly enjoyed it .
the best atmosphere in town for casual conversation or reading a book . the coffee and scones are great as well , but the atmosphere really makes this place .
the carpet is disgusting with garbage all over the place and the utensils and tablecloths with questionable at best . the bright lighting emphasized the filth .
the tom yum goong soup is a great starter , or if you prefer something crispy , their spring rolls are filled with flavor .
it 's so good i come up from gilbert on the way to see my wife .
maybe she was having a bad day ?
very good for the price .
think of the effect of having headphones one ; only the person effected by the sound notices how loud it is .
talk about an amazing location for an outdoor themed cafe .
so many restaurants sacrifice flavor in an attempt to make things hot but jalepeno 's incorporate both heat and flavor perfectly .
i love this pizza , the setting is good but , sorry guys you play the music very loud . i 'm not sure if the music is for the patrons ( i 've only seen families , older folks and not many millennials ) .
i also liked the layout of the place and the dark color scheme .
cozy place for socializing with friends or dates . they have normal cocktails from $ 14-16 or more fancy , extravagant cocktails for $ 30- $ 40 .
we tried chicken buffalo and rustic veggie and both were really good .
we ordered a double bowl with chicken katsu as both the `` proteins '' & when we got the food there was barely any chicken on the plate to the point it was spaced out to almost look like more , and you could see the huge servings of rice on the bottom .
they have an excellent cocktail menu with reasonable prices , along with a long happy hour ( something like 4-8pm ) . the happy hour features a few bucks off three different cocktails and a beer .
they have 4 types of sauces you can choose from , i tried the curry mango ( i think ) and the tartar , both were very good .
but the food tasted totally different from what i experienced before . the ribs were n't thoroughly cooked and did not taste good at all .
the decor and atmosphere is nice .
it 's cheap and a good value for what you get .
the sangria is one of my favorite drinks . try it with a couple of appetizers !
they also have a great patio that is right on a little lake .
great value and very cheap .
i ate out on the patio which gave a nice view . would recommend !
when they came , they were mean , unhelpful and not interested in serving .
also , a random unnecessary thing to note : the girls washroom has a very fancy sink , the guys do not .
the cocktails were also really good and not full of sweeteners .
i thought the noodles were awesome and the perfect `` al dente '' . i was with two other people and we each had very different different dishes that were each very unique and delicious in their own way .
our friends who own restaurants in dc recommended it .
my favorite would be zombie and mango mojito .
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
it 's a great down to earth place to get your grub on !
we switched to a 4 top bar table and they put us at the only one without silverware in the whole restaurant .
the lighting was n't too bright or too dim , just right .
great food for a decent price .
two things at sushi couture need to change asap : decor and lighting ( pot lights are so harsh ) .
this place is terrible . it dirty , the food sucks and the service is terrible .
but worse than the food was the poor lighting in this new place . horrible florescent bulbs give the place the look of a morgue .
one i had was three small tarts on one dish , it was a ok. we ordered 6 or 7 items , and majority were decent .
but the server said there would be another 5 minute wait time because they have to clean one for us .
soups and appetizers are really good as well . priced well and the staff is always great .
finally , a much needed alternative eatery in the growing downtown area for a causal breakfast or lunch . the feel is refreshing , welcomed natural lighting , comfortable and conversational , similar to a walk up cafe you would find in larger cities .
ordered a great viognier from the wine list , and it was ice cold .
my friend got the mocha , which had the perfect amount of chocolate . i got the ethiopian pour over , which had a really nice fruity taste .
i ordered diavolo pasta with grill chicken and sweet corn salad on side .
super cute set up .
i tried the strawberry soda , which was really delicious and came in an adorable glass boot .
beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor . or at least the menu was .
yup yup you read right , the theme of the entire restaurant changes .
only four beers on tap , none of which were particularly good .
the ambiance is cozy and inviting , and as they continue to develop the space it will only get better !
again , the staff is polite but untrained or socially awkward .
it 's reasonably priced and far better than standard .
this place never disappoints . been here to many times to count and never leave un happy .
the shortribs are amazing ... .
service was incredibly friendly and the prices are very cheap .
i was fully aware of what a foie gras was but i still did n't understand why you would insist on me consuming a $ 30 burger in your dining room with your loud tv blaring and the bright fluorescent lights .
all of the food was great . even the salads were tasty .
not the best gelato i 've had , but i definitely liked that they had a variety of unique options . all in all , it was a good experience .
horrible cooking first of all ! the meat is super dry and hard to the point where your teeth hurt .
they also try to be creative in some of their combinations -- for example , i had the bbq and mac-n-cheese special that also had crispy onions on it and it was very tasty .
i have been here many times and i love it .
a great time at a great place where the service is fast , personable , and just never seems to tire of bringing me food and drink .
i had a shrimp philly and cajun fries . the fries were delicious but the shrimp philly blew me away .
there was one girl on the counter , she took our order then proceeded to dish it out from the hot plates into the thali plastic take away container .
pizzas are mediocre and over priced . for a plain slice of cheese it 's $ 5.99 and the price rises for anything fancier than that .
nice touch . hey alice , who is the brilliant shit that decided metal leg chairs on concrete floor was a good idea ?
tldr : not bad for take out lunch food ( around $ 8- $ 12 ) .
good eats and lots of food for a reasonable price .
good food it is a bit pricey you should expect that in a vegas casino .
wine , beer and cocktails available . moderate prices .
great beers , bartenders do n't know anything about the beers . the menu is ok. not bad to pair beer with .
the decor is confused .
the ribeye was not that good , especially for $ 31 .
it 's piled nice . ambience is pub like - i like the patio more .
hostess told us 2+ hours , the only saving grace was they text you so you do n't need to stay at the restaurant .
while this is a cool place , i will not be returning because of the poor service and overpriced items .
anyway , the food was very good and quite reasonably priced .
the prices are very reasonable priced for the portion size and quality .
but wow , i have n't found a place this loud in a while .
it was nice that they had draft beer .
great music too , sang along all through brunch .
this is one of my favourite brunch places - the food is good , it 's bustling and comfortable , and what 's not to love about the hipster retro decor ?
the wine selection was amazing !
the only thing i felt okay was the smashed potato .
not sure why people rave about the margaritas , i think they either have no tequila , or it 's severly watered down .
i should have gone with wine since bad wine is better than pbr , coors light , or the m pilsner style ( not real pilsner ) beer that the server knew nothing about .
food is decently priced .
we wanted something with `` chips and salsa '' and a decent beer selection .
good prices as well .
mine was really good but hers was even better .
the next day i just had a glass of wine and yay for me they had a nice rose .
we went here on a friday night and enjoyed a good meal .
we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here and plan on visiting again soon .
let 's talk about the decor ... it 's so tacky that it 's awesome .
ordered the aviator and peach cocktail to start ... both were very refreshing and tasted great .
the lemon tahini dressing was pretty bland and did n't add anything to the salad , imho .
most of the above items would probably only cost $ 250 to fix and labor to clean the restroom ... .
only negative is that they are very under staffed so you may end up waiting a while .
definitely a great spot for a quick bite !
excellent selection of quality , reasonably priced food .
really good food at cheap prices .
love this place ! the decor is great ... not overdone , but comfortable .
it 's a nice some coffee shop ambiance .
the atmosphere of the restaurant is very zen ; it is not a huge space , so i would definitely recommend making a reservation .
the side of fries ( shoestring ) potatoes was not hot at all , barely warm but just ok. i probably would try this again to see if i had a better experience .
beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor . or at least the menu was .
ill definitely be coming here for a long time .
was drinking bottle beer so hard to not get that right .
i did not ask for any special tequila .
but i would never pay full price for it , whatever full price is .
this was the perfect place for brunch while trying to recover from a crazy night out on the town .
i should have gone with wine since bad wine is better than pbr , coors light , or the m pilsner style ( not real pilsner ) beer that the server knew nothing about .
plus the place is really small , so no matter where you sit you will hear the tv quite loudly .
she had beer and i had wine , both delicious .
their drink concoctions were good as well .
the house pickles were a fun snack , the meatball tagine were incredibly moist , had a nice smokey flavor too them and the sauce dipped perfectly into that toasty bread .
salmon was good , maybe a little undercooked .
it is unfortunate that crystal treated us this way .
the food was tasted bland and i found a piece hair in my bbq chicken . the place was dirty and had a smell of garbage .
went in there last week and dealt with a grumpy employee who was clearly miserable working there .
i do n't like sushi , so i got one of their only non-sushi dishes ( at least at the time ) that was some sort of pork in a soup .
once we finally got the attention of a server she did a good job .
we ordered bottled beers -- their beer selection is good , i will give them that .
wonderful , attentive wait staff . great with food allergies .
the lunch special pricing makes this place worth it imo . the food and service are both very good but the non special pricing is a little steep .
prices on bagel sandwiches are a little high , and seem to keep creeping up ( about $ 10 each with tax ) .
it 's only been open for a few weeks , and will soon become very popular i 'm sure .
i do love the architecture and interior design , but idk , it 's kinda dark and depressing , and not up to date with alot of stuff . my room was kinda crappy and did not have a flat screen like in the picture .
food is amazing and decently priced .
fried chicken sitting out on a tray - no tongs for the chicken or the hodge podge of stale and tasteless desserts .
and when she came to our table to take our plates away when there was still food in them , she would get annoyed .
the halibut was bland , salad dressing bland and the burger was a quarter of the size of the bun and overall was mediocre .
will go back for sure . great food & service .
make sure you try the infused cocktails .
it 's nice to sit outside .
i sampled the wings , salad and a bite of the burger , all of which were amazing .
the wines list is good as well .
i had heard just great reviews from friends so i had to try it out .
benefits are the views ask for a high floor and strip view .
the room space at strip steak was very cool considering it 's carved out of a shopping mall like space .
nothing special or terrible , but compared to the appetizers we ordered , it seemed kind of plain .
i also got the ahi tostadas that were insanely good !
super good food ! flat bread pizza , awesome !
food was pretty good . my smash fries did n't have much on them , tasted almost like reg fries .
the service and food was subpar , but i guess her guilt tripping the customer for a tip is her way to make up for lost tips in consequence from a poor dining experience .
cute little place -- felt like i was in a pub in england or something .
you wo n't be disappointed .
the atmosphere is great , downstairs in the basement of duckworth 's .
the servers are often forgetful - ignoring drinks that need refills , not bothering to write orders down and then getting them wrong , etc .
i ordered the 4 rolled tacos with guac and had a great meal overall . expect large portions , good prices and authentic offerings .
my only complaint would be the seating . if the table can seat 4 , they will not seat a table of 3 even if there are no other tables .
the macaroni and cheese was awful , cold and did n't taste good at all . the french fries were mediocre .
filet & we each ordered the $ 14 house salad which was an enormous bowl of spring mix with some cucumbers & a few nice cherry tomatoes .
i noticed tequila behind the bar but did n't see any beer and am unaware of what the happy hour entails .
the tables , chairs , and walls were kind of dinged up and worn looking .
the cheesy baked udon with seafood was also a hit .
there was only one other table but within , no joke , about 10 minutes , the place got packed !
the outside of the bar could use a little work but the inside and the patio , wow very cool .
drinks good as well .
fine food and fairly priced !
they serve the smallest bites of rice with their nigiri which was weird but not bad .
very average . if i 'm paying $ 70 for a 10 oz filet and $ 90 for a $ 25 bottle of wine , it better be the nicest place in town and the food should be fantastic .
nice by the glass wine choices .
great food . reasonable prices .
it was gothic , creepy , but strangely noisy .
good eats at cheap prices .
slow service , inconsistency in dishes , sometimes lukewarm food , pervasive blandness , and ingredients that have been sitting out too long are what await potential patrons standing awkwardly in the doorway unsure of when and where to sit .
i would love to say the decor is delightfully tacky , but it 's not . it 's just plain tacky .
the flavor of the food is good and the onion rings are absolutely massive .
unfortunately the red wine on tap was chilled which dulled the taste . the chardonnay on tap was better but tasted weak .
noel was our favorite .
it was very loud . the stained glass and pews were interesting , but the other random pictures on the walls did n't make sense .
i wish i could find a cocktail place this good closer to where i live . this place had it all : great atmosphere , wonderful , unique cocktails , warm service .
we sat on the first level at a smaller 2 person table/booth after waiting for only 20 minutes so i was happy about that .
great prices - just $ 7.95 lunch specials , many to choose from .
my only criticism is price . it 's 10-15 % more expensive than i 'd like .
the first time i went was on an elite group invite , it was awesome !
meal was cold , sent it back and was still cold .
long before i even moved to arizona , my brother would always bring us here when we would come to visit and it was pretty much my favorite place to eat at .
tons of options , tasty , and reasonable .
very reasonably priced as well .
prices are reasonable , maybe like $ 1-2 more for food than you would expect to pay .
the menu is full of all the carbs .
prices may be a tad high , but like i said , you do get a lot of food for the price .
price was really good as it came out to just under $ 100 including tip .
they were out of corona so i had a beer on tap sorry do not remember name but it was good .
it was delicious ! my date got the salmon with asparagus and was pleased as well .
while we did not drink any booze , they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers , wine , and specialty cocktails .
the price is right at $ 13.99 with a free player 's card ( note you ca n't get the card at the buffet so it 's $ 18.99 otherwise ) .
taste wise they were nothing special .
the unlimited beer/wine was nice , but there was only one craft beer on tap , which was disappointing .
it is priced just right .
but the prices were pretty high for what you get .
carolina vinegar , mustard , a really nice sweet and a perfect spicy - the last two served warm .
the inside of the restaurant also looked really nice and spacious .
ok good , but defently does not justify the price !
room was nice , but expected more . hallway was dirty , bathroom ceiling had hair stuck to it , ( gross ) , no coffee maker or refrigerator .
it 's inside harrahs resort and it 's a seat yourself kind of place .
we missed the fireworks : ( we had to hunt down the waitress to take our orders or bring the check . the check never came , we went to the front desk to pay .
the service seemed a bit slow , even though there were only a handful of patrons when we went for lunch around 3 pm .
i found this restaurant through yelp and what a great find it was .
for that price , you sure ca n't beat that .
the cheesecake was about the best we 'd had : light and airy , yet creamy and just the right amount of citrus .
walls are chipped up and needing attention and the lighting is just too bright .
food was average . and the worst part this morning - diarrhea .
it ended up being around 40 minutes . food was cold when we got it .
i did n't order a drink myself , but i tried some of my friend 's drink ( gladys knight - absolut mandarin , triple sec , malibu rum , grenadine , and pineapple juice ) and it was quite strong ... definitely a very strong alcohol flavour .
it was n't sweet or spicy just crispy chicken really hard to taste much else .
it 's a cool hip vibe and the patio is awesome .
the service is not bad at all .
the yamato roll really looked spectacular with the gold leaf , but there were only three pieces and there was a sweet sauce that completely overpowered the roll so i could not taste the foie gras .
prices were reasonable though .
my favorite part of the the experience was the decor it was beautiful and the food .
that was our servers story as she happily told us about the menu and delivered the food .
also , i liked two out of three of the martinis i had , but found one of the martinis incredibly bitter .
atmosphere : nice trendy open concept decor .
the decoration and interior really suck unfortunately .
it 's a little on the expensive side , especially if you order food and drinks ... expect to spend at least $ 70- $ 100 .
the soup was tasteless .
then the fact that a full meal is only 2 measly pieces of fish and some gross sides .
i look around and the place is dimly lit ... not in a romantic way , mind you , but more in that , `` we just forgot to change the light bulbs '' depressing kind of way .
nice place in old town scottsdale , i think `` trendy '' is the word .
it 's a small place , so this was loud and really annoying .
the total lack of customer service is at a whole another level .
not quite sure why this place has 3 stars , by far the best jamaican spot i 've ever been to .
for happy hour after downing a grey goose tonic , i decided to try their mango mojito .
not having beer descriptions in a beer bar is just wrong .
the ordering system is clumsy and there is only one terminal for the employees to put orders into .
the house margarita is very good ( and very strong ) .
the drinks are fantastic my fav - pineapple moscow mule and honey bourbon ( i forget the name ) .
the draft beer selection was lacking but the bottle service was awesome .
pizza was kind of blan . the crust had no flavor , literally just basic flavorless dough .
i love this place !
great service . price is reasonable .
the rice was extremely over cooked and mushy and there was , surprisingly , no flavor .
i was n't familiar with their menu and when i asked about what they offered she was very sarcastic pointing at the pictures on the wall as if i knew what they sold .
plus it 's only $ 2 for a tall cold one !
george checked up on us to see how our food was and even offered to close the front door because i was cold .
my turkey sandwich was delicious- mustard , avocado , garlic , bacon it was super filling and super good .
calamari appetizer was delicious .
good food and fair prices .
restaurant is very clean .
excellent service and wine selection .
the chicken was a little bland but at least it was moist , the hollandaise sauce was too thick and bland , the biscuits were fine , and the mashed potatoes were average .
like it a lot , very happy , cool collection of hindu trinkets and ladies ... . very chill .
it is a good value too .
cheap ok wines by the glass .
i especially like the white peach sparkling summer that is basically a lighter take on soda and the rose green tea with sea salt cap .
not sure what the point of mobile order pick-up is if the workers just ignore you .
i was especially amazed by the smoothie shots , creeps and dessert .
the bathroom is kinda shabby and could use good cleaning .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
with a long line behind me so i decided to pull up to the window and the man that was there gave me such a nasty attitude literally was about to snap on him .
only shining star was the decor .
even if the food is great it 's still not worth $ 18 for the moderate portions you get . and the drink is sure as hell not worth $ 12 .
it was hard to give a tip at this place because of how poor the service was .
would not recommend this `` hotel '' unless it was solely for the location or pool area ( which was pretty nice ) .
as for drinks , my girlfriend got a mojito which was good but could 've had more muddled mint and lime in it than ice cubes .
and , for $ 26 you ca n't go wrong .
the service is terrible .
not one of those trendy new beer bars . i wish i lived closer
i 've eaten at other indian cuisine restaurants around the city and i expect to pay around 15 or 16 dollars for good indian food . but $ 22.50 is a little ridiculous i think .
but the food is just okay . it is a little bland .
the porkchops are huge and crispy and tender .
paintings ) are weird , but i guess they 'd be good ice breakers or conversation starters .
not pleased at all . i bought the large shrimp one at $ 10 and had to throw it out after one spoonful .
zaba 's is close to my work , and i go here fairly often for lunch .
bar service was friendly and gin martini was strong but delicious .
the place is super cute inside and is much bigger than it appears when you walk in .
yeah , it was a bit expensive . i think it was $ 30 for girls and $ 50ish for guys , but that 's vegas .
i could n't believe the number of pieces of tofu they gave me , but even more incredible was the broth .
cafe : our waitress was very nice and helpful .
( what is wrong with sound absorbing ceilings , so seldom seen in toronto ? )
nice to have craft beer on tap and bottle . should n't be in a chilled glass though .
the food is creative and delicious .
wife had the taco salad with green chili chicken .
the green curry tofu bowl is amazing . there food is always full of fresh greens and veggies .
so i went to the nosh today . the service was very slow and the girl who took my order was very rude to not only me , but also her coworkers .
great prices and pretty fast .
with that said , i enjoyed their sake flight .
wings were terrible , we only got 5 instead of 6 and waitress said would discount them and forgot .
beers on tap were mostly simple ones nothing to get excited about .
is it worth 20 bucks ? no way but if its only 10 bucks take the deal .
they have good cocktails drinks that they have prepared for you and i love shock top on draft and they offered it .
if i wanted kung pao zucchini and bell peppers with one single piece of chicken , drowning in about 4 cups of bland sauce , i would have ordered that .
if i 'm in the mood for a salad the warm goat cheese is amazing ! my go-to is the pumpkin sage gnocchi , also with goat cheese , highly recommend .
i did n't try the beer , but it looked like decent alcohol choices .
the interior is a little odd , and i think needs some changing ( think random pops of color and very cheap furniture ) .
we were excited to hear they have live music during the weeknights that sets up downstairs .
it 's small and cozy inside , the staff is absolutely lovely and the food was fantastic .
thoroughly enjoyed this experience .
it 's in the ghetto and feels ghetto but it 's amazing ! so do n't let the looks put you off .
maybe i 'm just too americanized , but the portion was pretty tiny !
the margarita was n't anything special either .
great hole-in-the-wall kind of place that serves a fantastic italian beef sandwich for a cheap price .
the client did n't seem impressed but resigned to sit where she was told .
the spicy szechuan dishes are great . the heat from the spice will definitely warm you up on a cold night .
we had a couple of apps , all delicious , the the many pickled eggs was a standout . i had great lamb chops and my husband had some unbelievable pasta with chicken liver and spring peas and some other magical stuff .
my eyes hurt with all the cheap florescent lighting in here .
tried this place before remember the nasty meat husband ordered not remembering had to write this since its all worse .
we ordered a couple of flights and then had a glass of our favorite - outstanding wine selection !
drinks were surprisingly good , i actually liked the iced lemon tea here , and my dad was also satisfied with the iced milk tea .
i love the charming decor and the intimacy of the environment .
to be clear , this review is n't about the food , because unfortunately , we did n't have the opportunity to eat here .
i like to get a huge chewy mouthful of cheesy goodness and i did n't because i could n't , not enough cheese ! also there was barely any onions in it !
it does n't cost a cent to be nice .
reasonably priced , especially since they do n't charge for the adult . love that it 's only $ 8 on tuesdays and thursdays .
the setting looked old and bland . the roast beef was ok. the oatmeal was great and so were the sausage patties .
they have a full bar but i was more impressed with the 20 or so craft beers on tap .
prices are reasonable as well !
our service on the other hand was horrible .
it was extremely bustling , and just not an enjoyable atmosphere .
the bacon waffles was something different , i liked that part . the chicken on the other hand i was n't too much of a fan , the breading was a little off to me and the sauce that was on the plate did not go well with the meal , it tasted like soy sauce .
the soup was good but nothing spectacular . the cheesecake was not that exciting .
it seems like the lighting was a bit dim if i remember correctly , but the ambiance was a nice typical `` restaurant '' y feel .
we got there and the man taking our order was very nice but while there was only one other customer in the restaurant , it took us 18 minutes to get our food .
their fries are also really good , they are very thin and crispy .
i was warned ... `` do n't get fooled by the pretty colors and sparkly lights ! ''
i highly recommend trying this place .
beer was ok , but not quite cold enough . nice bartender but a second bartender was needed .
thank you again lindsay and everyone and capital grille for such an amazing event , events like these make being a yelp elite member truly special !
long wait for service , super small portions waiters that straight out lie to you this was quite ridiculous .
i think that it was a bit expensive for what it was though $ 17 .
he loves az and this just further made him gush over our beautiful town .
the keg is usually a great place to go for dinner , but unless you want a loud atmosphere where you can barely hear each other ... .do n't sit in the bar .
the ceiling has this unique writing on it - it 's like matte black and then someone spent unimaginable hours writing unique phrases all over the ceiling .
today my husband and i were excited to go to our spot to get some sushi , sadly it was the worst i 've had in a long while.. my salmon was super fishy and even my california roll was fishy , how does that even happen ?
all were tasty and very reasonably priced .
a really well made sangria topped off this perfect meal .
very disappointing for a place that charges $ 30 per plate .
it looks a little scary , but do n't let the carpet on the floors scare you .
service was also amazing . our server was professional , informative and super sweet .
in their defense , the bottled beer was good .
the servers are either rude and unaccommodating or eerily cheery and overly familiar .
i liked the choice of dipping sauces .
i noticed a decent beer selection but was disappointed to hear that they had no drink specials .
internet cut in and out a bit , and the a/c was a little too strong , but overall this was a great place to chill for the afternoon . the decor is super cute , and i would definitely return for food/drinks .
makes me uncomfortable and i find it tacky .
very appetizing . bonus , we took some engagement pictures inside and outside and lt added a cute uptown charlotte touch !
the finance tried a mojito and i drank the berry champagne , which was also good .
the crab rangoon was good , but it was probably because it was literally just cream cheese in a wonton .
my only big gripe is that i paid over $ 10 for a milkshake that was supposed top have booze in it .
they also only have beer , no wine at all .
the bar area is open with easy access from the inside shopping area of the casinos . there is adequate seating .
it might sound weird , but check out the bathrooms .
this place is dimly lit , but not to the extreme where you can not read the menu without your server pulling out a pen light .
it was good but not 13 dollars good .
glad this place closed !
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
food is really cheap .
i think my total was about $ 18 ( i was n't the one paying this time ) .
food is nothing spectacular at all . definitely does n't justify the price .
their strawberry sake is one of my favorite drinks , i get a bottle every time .
this place is awesome !
the service was great we were always asked if everything was okay and our glasses were never empty .
just not $ 70 good .
however , my food was warm but not hot , so ... it was n't awful but i have had better .
and the price of the 8 inch was under $ 5.00 highly recommend for all .
easy vibe for those just want to sit or stand and relax , but also offers a nice dance space for those in the mood . appeals to a 30-something crowd and hipsters ...
the noodles were definitely undercooked and the meat was dry .
i was not disappointed at all .
also , very good prices !
very surprised to find this in vegas .
it looks nice , but the set up was quite awkward .
we tasted the burger with cheese and was incredible !
the service was very slow and the server did n't know the difference between a draft and bottled beer .
food was mediocre and definitely not worth the $ 60 we paid .
their deserts are also very good but the salads and soups are the best .
however , a hispanic man who parks cars for the hotel was very creepy and inappropriate , asking my girlfriend questions about our relationship when i was away . shockingly , she did n't leave me for someone working valet service .
i do n't mind paying high prices on good bakery items but this place is not good .
decent prices for everything .
the food was nothing exciting and it is not a comfy atmosphere at all .
portions are perfect , and the price was great . sauces are very good .
so i glance at prices not crazy expensive but some what expensive .
i had the ahi tuna salad which was perfect and my wife had a dinner salad with chicken . our friends had the fish tacos and the tri tip salad and all i heard was yummy yummy .
average food and service for the price of expensive restaurant .
it is , however , a great option in the lower price range .
the concept to izakayas are small pub style eateries with alcohol and loud music .
at their prices they can afford to be fair .
nice to have craft beer on tap and bottle . should n't be in a chilled glass though .
well drinks are pretty weak , so i stick to beers .
so literally 3 minutes go by with no response and now 2 more cars have pulled in behind me .
we were about to order dessert when we realized we were running late for a show . we had already ordered cappucinos so we asked our waiter if her could make them to-go .
pretty expensive for the portion but it 's worth it .
prices are reasonable and the staff is somewhat attentive .
do n't use the bathroom and do n't expect a clean interior .
i ordered the spicy miso and was disappointed in how salty the broth was .
grab a quick diner bite while you are downtown . cool view of the casino floor from the tables !
cost wise , a meal for one ( entree and tea ) is about $ 15 .
unfortunately , no bud light lime on tap so we just drank regular beer .
i did n't really have any expectations to be honest .
the burger was barely cooked , maybe blood rare , but i ate it anyway . it was actually pretty good .
casual atmosphere and decor .
great place for a romantic get a way ! food and service were great !
best happy hour . great drinks and food .
i 'm pretty sure the employees remember me and my friends by now .
we opted to eat in the bar / lounge area , which is actually quite nice .
i was going to order food for the whole family but with her bad attitude i just walked away .
took one star off for the expensive prices .
only reason it 's not 5 stars is because of the price , $ 17 for a lunch is a little too much for me .
beers were ok , but they were bottled beers , so it would be pretty difficult for them to ruin that .
the place is huge , with a classic biergarten atmosphere .
drinks- bottomless plum drink is a nice addition to have side dishes- good . very average
i like this spot for the decoration & delicious coffee . this is a good hanging out spot to chill for me .
the service from beginning to end is good and the room like the whole casino is gorgeous , open and well lit but not crowded .
the food and drinks are actually great and reasonably priced .
i did find that all the bright colors and decorations did a lot to brighten my mood at 3am .
very cheap and tasty food .
a little oily but so good .
you can get a sampler tray , which i love .
we got seated on the patio which had a great view of the strip .
i do not believe it was good enough to charge the prices they charge .
food is super cheap .
beer was just not good .
i 'll start off saying that our server was awesome , the manager leo was unbelievably rude !
the spring greens were fresh , the grapes were crisp and sweet , chicken and the dressing were delightful . the smoothie was my personal favorite .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
the hubs had pasta bianca and i only tried a bite , but it was also excellent .
it 's a bit tacky , but not overwhelming .
c ) a ton of great and creative choices for bagels .
very friendly staff too ...
it was a bit underwhelming and the atmosphere was a bit awkward ( not sure what they are trying to accomplish with the offensively ostentatious purple neon lighting ) .
to top it all off the walls were painted a really ugly color .
its cheap and good .
: ) pro tip : the perfect cocktail to accompany this dining experience is a dirty martini .
food was very poor for the expensive price .
that 's when i stepped in and said it was dirty that we were n't making this up .
i love their home-made bread !
i ordered my noodle dish mild ( since i have only ever been served it this way ... actually normally sweet ) and it came out pretty spicy and not in a good way . i ate half of it and moved on ... probably wo n't be back even to try another dish .
it 's sketchy as fuck .
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
i opted for the peach iced tea this time , which was refreshing and full of flavor .
too bad no beer though .
nice inside and out .
the chips were bland , and the guaca was too chunky for dipping - you basically had to use a utensil and scoop the guaca onto the chip to eat it .
i loved this place !
came again this week and loved it .
staff so nice ! just had lunch with family here .
the fish did not seem fresh at all , as if it were sitting out to dry .
we even got a free glass of wine for checking in .
the price is a bit expensive when considering the customers are mainly seniors .
the mint and jalapeño added great depth to this dish .
and did i mention that the margarita was very weak ? i think the bartender forgot the tequila .
the duck was cooked perfectly and it went brilliantly with the waffles and syrup .
the prices seem reasonable too .
excellent service , great food , beautiful restaurant . the waitstaff were incredibly friendly and professional .
i was n't drinking but looked like a good beer selection .
plus , the prices are fantastic .
beer was nice big but no cold glass .
which in this case is under quality food at high quality prices .
they normally feel franchised , bland , etc .
anyway , i took advantage of the happy hour beer specials , but unfortunately i really hated the second beer ( something by deschutes that i think might have been skunked ) .
cool little pittsburgh spot at the top of mt . washington .
what bar does n't have coors light ? did not have it in bottle or draft .
love the verrado grille ! enjoyed dining on the patio where the fireplace adds such a warm touch at sunset .
i sent the restaurant an email after our experience and got absolutely no response .
bacon brownie and buttermilk pie are n't made in-house but are very good .
great dining experience , on the expensive side but worth the money .
i did not pay close attention to my bill the first visit to see if that is common , but i found it weird .
great selection of drinks .
the ceiling has this unique writing on it - it 's like matte black and then someone spent unimaginable hours writing unique phrases all over the ceiling .
the soups were a good way to warm up with a little chill in the air .
the food itself is average , but it 's satisfying & reasonably priced .
good bar to drink at ... but maybe not eat at
everyone is so friendly and welcoming and very skilled .
ca n't beat it for downtown joint this good and that price point .
it 's not dirt-cheap , but prices are reasonable for the heap of food you get .
they appear to have a pretty big list of beer , but i do n't drink beer !
i always love the service here .
reasonably priced , too .
both entrees came with a side of our choice , and the dish of garlic mashed potatoes was huge !
i 've ever had a more dry , dense , piece of fried fish ever .
my friend had a gin drink with blackberry that was much more pleasant .
great price and good quality .
good cocktails and beverage selection .
seasoning and that hot sauce my god is it phenomenal .
just a great classic fresh cut fry with great thick salt .
great cocktails , but no draft beer . need i say more ?
the burgers were delicious and had a very consistent and smoky flavor similar to that of a whopper .
not only that but i find it very unprofessional to see the servers and cooks directly in front of customers telling jokes and snickering like that .
really loved my burgers on a late night and love how affordable the food are here !
our server was informed that the apple pie was n't up to standards to serve , so she had to break the bad news to us . needless to say we were disappointed and she could tell .
a wonderful place to visit .
we started with drinks at the bar for happy hour , i got myself a blackberry margarita with a salt rim .
the food and wine was also great .
great food . very nice staff/owner .
this was a typical night at the vig . uptight stuffy vibe with service that is dreadful .
wine selection was awesome .
the foh staff at vivace is for sure acceptable , everyone knew what they were doing .
beers are cheap for a restaurant .
while we did not drink any booze , they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers , wine , and specialty cocktails .
they keep the restaurant clean and tidy .
it is a reasonable price for really great food .
very reasonable prices also . $ 20ish
when he mentioned it to the waitress , she just shrugged and said sorry we 're busy .
as for alcohol it 's bottled beer and a few selections of wine only here .
fresh is not a way to make me happy that i am paying $ 7.00 for a little burger that should be half the price and the size for kids .
we also got a slice of chocolate cake to share for dessert and it was very good , though very rich !
everything was reasonably priced .
the prices are super as well .
drinks are delicious . i always leave happy .
their prices are very reasonable too .
from the tremendous clutter of all the weird decor to some odd items like a statue of a topless women ?
the lighting was a little bright but maybe that 's just me .
it was not bad , but it was so extremely salty !
they have a good tequila list though i was n't drinking tonight .
the price was n't terrible at about $ 10.50 each .
you will definitely pay for it though . very expensive .
our particular server ( maybe her name was alicia ) had a bad attitude and did not care to offer her best service to an already horrible experience .
the prices are very reasonable along with a good selection .
it 's sketchy as fuck .
great spot to check everything off your list for a sunday . grab a bite to eat , grab some groceries and maybe a quick snack or drink to cool you down .
the other annoying thing was the bright fluorescent lighting from the kitchen that shines directly in the eyes of half the patrons .
only tiny tiny issue - if you ask for a patio table via yelp you most likely will not get one . i was advised at check in that you have to call .
a little expensive , but i feel as if it 's mostly justified .
the place is on the second floor of a mall and the ambience is stark with k-pop blaring on the tvs , which was also pretty great for a solo traveller .
i also ordered the egg rolls and they were fantastic !
the chicken ramen was n't convincing . what appeared to tasted like sliced turkey breast was served in chicken broth .
dark , poor lighting and big tables that are uncomfortably .
pretty standard , over priced , casino restaurant . i had linguine pescatore which was really good , but it definitely did not justify the $ 27 price tag .
upon walking in there were a good amount of people either waiting to order or waiting for their food .
the ambiance was great in this place .
gordon 's idea of a limited menu may be nice but if the one main food on the menu is bland , then the entire restaurant is bland .
my filet was cooked well and was extremely flavorful . my fella 's lamb was really great as well .
such a creative dish and so huge ! the portions here are monstrous , so come here with a big appetite .
the brisket pho is really delicious - incredible broth , garnished with crispy mung bean sprouts , and a slice of lime . the bubble tea is more of a slush than a traditional tea- but is also pretty tasty .
about 11 $ for 2 slices total seemed a bit harsh but it 's delicious and its vegas .
first visit i had a chicken protein bowl and my friend had spaghetti - we each liked our entrees and the warm bread is also very good .
the place is great for studying , because of the comfy chairs , plugs , free wifi , but that 's about it .
mind you we had some delicious drinks .
the price is great .
i 'm questioning how , because it was just ok , there was hardly any chicken !
drink ; i ordered key west lemonade ( $ 5 hh special ) it tasted like a long island spot on.. i ordered a 2nd lol
also ordered the sangria which was very refreshing in 100 degree weather . the burrata was rich and creamy and the sangria had a mint twist to it that gave it a mojito taste .
not bad , just not amazing either and at $ 8-10 not a great deal either .
the server was a little sketchy and the decor a little frightening ( creepy fat people paintings ... weird ! ) but overall it was n't an unpleasant experience .
they have a decent drink menu as it is a must to enjoy beverage while admiring the view .
it was more like lukewarm soup with no flavor . everything was kind of lukewarm ... .
the asian food though especially the mongolian beef , was very dry and extremely salty .
i think the pricing is good for their selection .
4. the entire place was out of all draft beer except some shitty orange something .
makes it easy to pick something up quick and yummy for dinner .
the service is good and bad , the dude on the cashier has the highest resting bitch face and attitude but the manager is really nice .
you wo n't be disappointed .
it 's impossible not to have fun listening to timeless hits .
the portions are huge and enough to bring home without compromising quality .
anyway , i took advantage of the happy hour beer specials , but unfortunately i really hated the second beer ( something by deschutes that i think might have been skunked ) .
i had the wild cheese tortellini and found it to be a bit bland . my husband had the bolognese which i also found to be a bit bland .
my favourites were the hot chicken , it was succulent and tender and any filet cut of meat . the prime rib with cheese was so flavourful and so was the house steak .
makes sense though , the food is awesome and reasonably priced .
just a super cool place to be for a summer night out .
i 'm not sure what the magic ingredient is to achieving a `` retro '' rather than `` old and neglected '' ambiance , but fresh floor tiles ( or , you know , something sensible like laminate ) and seat cushions that are not held together by duct tape would be a start .
and reasonably priced for what you can get .
my favorite drink is the watermelon drink on the menu .
my only complaint is the cost - it 's ridiculously overpriced .
keep up the good work .
as for the drinks , delicious ! all martinis were half off for happy hour .
i do wish that the toppings were cut up a bit more , the sausage was so big that it was kind of awkward to split up the pieces so all had some .
i got a beer sampler and a couple of the beers were ok , but nothing really impressive .
it was only half full and for over $ 10 that 's a rip off .
great selection of food , nice cozy atmosphere .
relax and slow down , enjoy one of their cool cocktails and the company you are with for a delightful evening .
also , my favorite sauce is the pineapple sweet and sour sauce !
it was good whatever it was .
the mirror was a bit dirty .
still it 's good and the prices are moderate .
have two starts because of the decor on the inside was nice .
super hip and trendy place that we had to check it out .
we both started off with a presidente beer , which was the special for that evening .
food was good , breakfast buffet nice .
the wine was great , we got a couple bottles .
the seating is also very tight and uncomfortable .
we also enjoyed the two dinner specials and a bottle of wine from the wide selection on the wine list .
prices were very reasonable .
also had some hummus , it was watery and sort of a weird gooey texture .
this review is for the lounge area only .
unless you count dust on the tables as decor . only upsides ?
they had a pretty decent beer selection from what i recall . additionally they offered wine selections .
it was n't hot and just tasted bland .
for almost $ 18 this should of at least been hot .
filling and decently priced food .
although the sandwich had just been grilled , the inside was still somewhat cold .
i had a blended cherry sangria with frozen margarita tonight which was delicious .
it could look nicer if the lights were n't so harsh .
they have a fantastic happy hour .
it was deliciously crisp and tangy with a really good bite afterwards .
plus when i went to the counter to try and get the rest of my order i was ignored . when the guy on the counter finally realized what was wrong he told another girl to finish my order .
nice to have craft beer on tap and bottle . should n't be in a chilled glass though .
although it was good , it was n't the best i 've had . the fish itself was a nice big piece , but i found the batter and tartar to be a bit bland .
again - i love the design and atmosphere .
the restaurant is huge and their patio sections are enclosed so you get the best of being outdoors ( even when it 's raining ) and natural light from the skylights .
we were given hot water instead of cold , so she made another complaint .
it 's just cheap .
he loves quality food and their bread and pastries are definitely fresh and delicious .
we also had margaritas which you could hardly taste anything but a pre-made margarita mix .
food , drinks , atmosphere and a great happy hour is a plus ! yum : )
pricing is not bad at all .
this is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley .
food and drinks are horrible and the service does n't make up for it . i came in around 9 and just got dessert and a drink .
after a hideous experience at another west valley sports bar i was pleasantly surprised by the quick and friendly service i had today .
the tuna rolls are surprisingly excellent , seared ahi and delicious sauce that comes on the plate .
also , i 'm more of a wine person , but the cocktails were great !
we ordered the shrimp dumplings which apparently is a special because it is not even on the menu .
not bad for a 11 dollar per person meal . the food is n't that spicy ( even on medium ) great food for its location
at $ 150 a plate , it is on the high end of meals i have ever had .
the service was as outstanding as the atmosphere and i 'll tell everyone i know going to vegas to check this place out !
the servers with the exception of one or two are all rude .
also , good selection of beer , 15 tap beers and about that many in a bottle .
a server needs to be attentive to his/her table , apologetic if need be , make sure their table is taken care of as best as possible .
super tacky in my opinion .
went here for the first time the other day after finding it on yelp . so many delightful options to choose from as i walked around the store .
now service sometimes can be a little rough but most of the time great .
this is a big , nice , beautiful space with plenty of bar and patio along with regular seating .
he was definitely nice and accommodating with my group .
the room was super small , one day we had only cold water called the front desk and was told it was a busy shower time to try again later .
the salmon was good , but the bagel itself , while it looked like a bagel , was very bland and tasted more like unsalted bread than a bagel .
cheap price . you get what you pay for i guess .
bad service , i went through the drive thru , and the girl just gave me the food without any emotion or talking to the customer , not even a signal word . also , i found out that she did n't even give me some napkins ... the foods alright
however , the soup was pretty tasteless .
towels everywhere , questionable fluids on the floor , just completely dirty .
it 's just a casual and relaxed atmosphere .
cucumber gin drink was pretty strong , but not necessarily tasty .
when we tried to order drinks , the were out of the only draft beer , negro modelo ... and 3-4 of the bottle beers , and my 1st tequila choice ... then the bartender actually told me the hefeweizen bottle beer was `` just '' like the 2x ipa they were out of ... .really ?
the hot & sour soup does not taste like a hot and sour soup ( very bland if you can believe that ) , it looked almost like a wonton soup .
cocktails we had were great , strong , worth the money .
overall the food is good . the chicken and beef kabobs are great , hummus and rice is ok and the salad is boring .
all that and make it a combo and they charge $ 9 . wow
we tried the bruschetta which was perfect for two people . we asked the bartender to pair our app with some drinks and he did a great job with the sorry , not sorry and a glass of moscato .
it was only ok. the waffle lacked flavor , but the ham was good .
it is a very beautiful cafe and the food and staff is great .
i must say they had quite an impressive menu with tons of options and special combos for lunch .
since fat means flavor , dry and boring is the best thing i can say about it .
the staff was also super friendly , and really cared about how we were enjoying our food . we chatted for awhile with the manager ( brittany ) who was very sweet and nice .
cheap large & tasty food for vegas prices .
good selection of wine and spirits .
i was slightly disappointed that they did n't have wine only beer .
the decor is a little tired , hole in the wall - but not horribly off putting .
my favorite dish was the pork skewers -- must try .
they have plenty of sochu drinks and infused vodka 's and on sundays great martini specials and great house music . i have never been just for dinner so i ca n't comment on that but sunday nights are a great atmosphere with great food and drink specials .
about the drink i 'm really wan na recommend lychee sage ( sweet and easy for drink ) also about service the restaurant is great .
the space looks nice and clean inside and the bar is well stocked .
walked into the restroom only to find blood all over the sink , counter and floor . the employee 's response was `` oh we had a guy on meth in there earlier , sorry '' ... i change my mind , disgusting is to say the least .
just ridiculous they do n't deliver . what are they trying to do ?
the pad thai reminded me of thai express in that it was almost the same which is kinda sad coming from a restaurant .
the lobby looks good but get any further and you start to see the nasty ceiling tiles , cracked and stained drywall , broken faucets , moldy grout and broken furniture .
called to get take out today and was told prices on the website were wrong but prices just raised slightly .
clean and friendly staff , superb food .
the menu prices here are fairly high and super expensive for my taste .
i love this neat little gastropub in phoenix .
friendly server made for a great experience .
they have some cool specialty sandwiches ( such as their famous thanksgiving themed one ) , but their philly cheesesteak is also pretty good ! the sandwiches are pretty big and well worth their price .
helps that the service is great and there is always a manager coming by to ensure good service .
it really was n't that bright ( bright finish , but immediate taste was dark ) .
the host guy was not pleasant and said that there is no room for strollers .
i do expect good service and for my order to be correct .
decent food though it did not seem particularly authentic or exotic and felt very much like a chain .
the prices were reasonable .
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
the prices are awesome .
they only had one person working .
there were no vegetables mixed in with the chicken , which some pictures showed .
on beautiful days the outside patio area is just amazing .
all the curtains were down too which made it unnecessarily dark . mediocre .
the only thing that was any good was the crinkle cut fries and the white rice .
the only odd thing whew the extremely low chairs .
bad idea ! margaritas were ok but not booze in them !
she forgot the my drink and i finally got it after 45 minutes in the restaurant .
head on over to salty to check out happy hour , just stick with the chips and salsa , a cold beer and maybe a quesadilla .
great service , my only complaint is the $ 8 per person fee to play games .
there was n't much of a tap selection . also i do n't know if we picked 6 bad beers or if the taps were bad but none of the beers were good .
i tried an off menu watermelon soda ( that they make there ) and it was really good . not a huge watermelon fan , but the drink turned me into one !
it is our best friends ' birthday and my husband and i decided to treat him and his wife to a nice dinner .
it was insanely disappointing .
just stopped off for a glass of wine . good wine list .
i ordered the moroccan salmon , and it was fantastic ! the spices were just the right amount , the salmon was n't over cooked , the quinoa and salad was a great accompaniment .
there was also a good selection on tap , but there were no descriptions of the beers on tap , nor were there any prices for beer indicated on the menu .
terrible menu . expensive prices and all for show .
everything was delicious ! the phos were enough food for two meals .
the margaritas were excellent - on the rocks , and made with fresh lime juice . the tequila was evident and tasty .
the sangria was delicious and went so well with the manicotti . my husband had the glazed salmon which he loved and was a really generous portion .
the presentation of food items is what i love .
we understand mistakes happen and really appreciate metro realizing there was a problem and fixing it to ensure that we were satisfied .
bathroom is a decent size ... .the full length mirror in the bathroom is really nice , but they do n't have any other mirrors in the room other than the two in the bathroom ... ..which was weird ... .
one note , i have read that the bathroom is dirty i have yet to find the men 's bathroom dirty .
beer was ok , but not quite cold enough . nice bartender but a second bartender was needed .
both huge portion , homemade bread , everything seems to be made from scratch .
you 'd expect to have the most amazing delicious `` i 've never tasted something so good '' experience when you pay $ 120 for 2 people .
the store front itself was a perfect little shop that was incredibly well decorated from ceiling to floor .
still good , just not what i thought it would taste like . that being said , the wrap is hella delicious .
the ambiance of the restaurant is very cool .
these chops were truly smothered in a killer gravy , seasoned to perfection and were so tender i only needed my fork to cut into them ; reminded me of my grandmother 's cooking .
overall great food , easy parking and very nice staff .
the food can be compared with an expensive nyc restaurant . here you spend 12 $ for a huge plate .
only concern is that the bathroom looks a little rundown .
the mini souvlaki plate was really good chicken and beef were tender and savory .
great food for reasonable price .
for $ 30 ( $ 40 on weekends ) you can have mediocre buffet for breakfast , lunch and dinner instead of just one meal .
it typically costs about $ 4 - $ 6 for a drink which is pretty normal for bubbletea .
also they have lunch specials which are ridiculously cheap !
i tried 4 separate amazing cocktails and 2 we 're gin which i usually hate .
the cocktails were my favourite part - we tried the coco lemonade cocktail and the ko cocktail both refreshing and not too sweet !
they also have a full bar and delicious cocktail menu .
only gripe was the sangria was too light .
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
just stopped in for a quick glass of wine and wow !
the ceiling has this unique writing on it - it 's like matte black and then someone spent unimaginable hours writing unique phrases all over the ceiling .
prices are great as well .
also a one off thing but the overhead light on the table was like a 10k watt surgical spotlight . it actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright .
their salsas and bean dip are very good . great chips as well .
no beer on tap , though , which is disappointing .
kind of looks trashy .
the coffee is extremely superior . the atmosphere is perfect to bring a laptop and get some work done as well .
keep up the great work !
vegetarian paella is wonderful , as are the flatbreads .
the happy hour discount on the drinks was good too !
he recommended a great bottle of on the road grenache .
prices are n't outrageous , besides the typical strip markup .
every drink was intricate , delicious , and did i mention strong ?
the price is only 50 cents more for a large in most cases .
the servers and management staff are super friendly and always eager to hell you out .
i recommend getting their lemonade if you feel like drinking something chilled and refreshing ( and are tired of drinking water lol ) .
the greek salad is fantastic . very fresh !
all of vegas is so ridiculously overpriced for what you get its hard to give anything 5 stars , but lets put the price tag aside .
both were very good . for entrees , we had the pork chop and the ny strip steak .
the creepy , outdated statues are n't not doing any favors for this place .
every bite was full of flavor .
it hit the hotspot for sure .
happy hour beer , wine & appetizer menu prices are awesome !
i absolutely loved the fried chicken and the beef bacon inside .
got a pretty decent package for like $ 35 a night for the deluxe room so that is much cheaper than what i usually spend .
shots , beer all good but i did not their food .
those terrible ones consist of waiting for what seems like 20 minutes for your drink order to come , then another 30 for your food , all the while they 're off doing who knows what .
crust is light and fluffy , and the combination of cheeses are perfect .
for the price , you ca n't beat this place . great food in a no-frills atmosphere .
besides being out of the way on the strip , the interior and decor are completely outdated and worn .
great server , amazing mixologist at the bar happy to craft a custom concoction .
sweet and sour pork was fresh and served hot .
nice seating area , long counter/bar .
with thirty some craft beers and wines on tap , beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender .
expensive for what it is . for a restaurant going for a street food vibe , meals averaging to $ 20 after tax and tips is definitely not street food prices .
like for real , it 's almost creepy .
the lights gave the place an uncomfortable feel .
really nice place , great ambience .
the place is clean , organized and friendly . highly recommended !
great amount for the price , would say inexpensive , not cheap .
not exorbitant , but not cheap .
weird decor and bad food .
we got home and i was very excited to try the pizza but much to my dismay i opened the box to find canned mushrooms all over .
cheap food . great value .
but the bartenders were pretty poor at mixing a good margarita .
it looked moist and amazing .
sorry but we really do n't like the remodel .
$ 35 for 4 people with drinks is n't too bad price wise .
the bartender was rude and did n't know anything about the beers on tap .
the decor is bright , and the seating design is average .
get in your car right now and go !
summer strong enough for a 4 pm happy hour drink !
one of my favorite restaurants in vegas , if not my favorite restaurant in vegas .
i took a look at the beer list and was pretty impressed , as they had at least fifteen different beers on tap , plus i think that they had a bottled beer list as well .
they have a great drink menu as well .
the decor was dark but did n't feel creepy .
food taste nice and price is cheap .
very small bar . the bud light on tap was ice cold and the bartender was friendly and introduced himself as rich .
if you 're going to eat here suggest you order italian staples ie pasta , chicken parm etc my colleagues enjoyed their meals .
the chicken sandwich is just so freaking amazing .
the prices are pretty cheap and the portions are great !
more disappointing were our entrees the spicy beef was actually very bland and the sauce looked straight from a bottle , like something you expect from a take-out only chinese restaurant .
chicken tasted like that really fake gummy chicken . and it was cold .
he knew enough about the wine list to suggest a terrific red i really enjoyed , and took the time to make my wife 's non-alcoholic drink in a champagne glass to make it pretty .
i love coming here .
so excited , i 'm fact , that we came two weekends in a row !
the prices for dinner are way too high for what you get , not in terms of quantity but quality .
great atmosphere and no waiting on a saturday night !
so , the yelp says free glass of wine or beer with check in .
the interior is bright , festive and i just loved it .
great experience = a happy me and a satisfied belly : )
surprised that there were a few true craft beers ( in bottles , no taps ) .
everything was smooth and flawless and even though i only paid $ 150 for a room that normally costs upwards of $ 300 , the service that we received was definitely no indicator of how much we paid .
flavor was ok , but i did n't like the big bone i found in my chicken .
our waitress miranda disappeared for a long time while we were waiting for salad dressing and was noticeably irritated when we had to ask a bus boy to go find her . we will not be back , sad , so sad
the unlimited beer/wine was nice , but there was only one craft beer on tap , which was disappointing .
beer - the beer selection was nothing special and they do n't serve it in a cold glass .
the rest of the food was also ok. nothing terrible , nothing great .
the wine was delicious definitely worth getting a bottle of wine and enjoying the moment .
also , get one of their awesome cocktails .
i 'm usually pretty alright eating most things , but i could not stomach even more than one of the dumplings because of the casing , which was extremely chewy and gelatinous .
perfect location just outside the strip so there 's plenty of parking .
i also had the chance to try the tuscan chicken sandwich and the beef fajita panini , which are both amazing as well .
not only that the food is amazing . i always get the champagne salad but my fiancé gets the lasagne which i steal bites and it is delicious !
the wine we had was great .
wine list is good as well .
in san diego , great place , even though it was crowded service was great !
pizza was cooked good but flavorless .
limoncello collins and white sangria are two really sweet drinks . of course the view is outstanding ... .
vip has a great drink menu as well .
good thing it is at a bar and i could get an ice cold draft beer .
my husband had the carbonara , which was bland , like bacon bits boiled in a cream sauce .
they were only $ 1 each , which to me is a steal !
the food is also delicious - but my one complaint is about portion sizes .
this is a great place for children to run and play in a comfortable cool environment .
anyway , i sat outside with a view of the canal on their absolutely beautiful patio .
the waitress was very nice , but the food was horrible ! there was a big plastic strip in one of the salads , the steak was very small and not that good , the shrimp tasted undercooked .
prices are just a little high , they could probably drop them by two dollars or so across the menu .
every time i go the servers give me a small free sample of something !
great service on the patio . came for happy hour but tequila tuesday even better !
new owners work their butts off and are super friendly . i recommend this place for sure .
the staff was running around playing and being really loud .
they make a good cocktail .
loud . needs sound panels ... or be a lip reader .
the prices are also pretty high for breakfast .
oozing with buttery cheesy goodness and a touch of the topping that had baked up brown and i may as well have died and gone to heaven .
this is mighty helpful as the church crowd positively takes over so many charlotte eateries after 11 am ... hubs and i met some friends for sunday brunch and i was quite excited to try their fare , as providence cafe had just been featured in charlotte magazine .
the prices are crazy low and the food is tasty .
a bright colored rug / blanket hangs on the wall , drowning out notice of any other wall decor that might have been there .
the veal and chicken parm are excellent ... really cheesy . the alfredo and chicken picatta are also both really good .
lets not forget the decoration that is ugly as well .
good food great prices , between 12am and 6am . menu is n't extensive it 's all under priced .
i asked for a blended margarita and was told they only do on the rocks . what kind of bar does n't have a blender ?
all in all it was very good and reasonably priced .
every meat was dry ! only thing to eat was chicken .
the good beer was n't on special at all , and their `` domestic '' beers were all pretty much the crap i wo n't drink .
we enjoyed the cooler weather by sitting on the private inside patio .
ambiance is whimsical and cozy .
my two stars are for the nice kid that placed my order correctly and the manager who politely gave me my refund .
only negative , not many beers on tap , we ordered three times before we got a beer listed that they actually had on tap : (
the blue sky salad with chicken is my favorite salad and the chicken sandwich el quac is delicious as well .
the food was good , however , we were extremely disappointed with our rude waitress and poor service .
the atmosphere is perfect .
they have a great drink menu too !
also , the prices are high .
i love the goofy chicago shit on the walls , and the haphazard menus that dont make any sense all over the walls .
i 've only been here once , i was recommended by my cousin to order the blush peach signature iced tea since i love anything rose !
this place is ridiculously good ( a tad pricey ) .
just a heads up they do n't have liquor , only wine and beer .
the lighting is odd ... it is dim , but not the right kind of dim . it 's not warm lighting it is like fluorescent bulbs dimmed .
he talked me into a seasonal blue drink that was very strong and delicious and you get to keep the glass which i like .
the space is really cool and unique , i 'll give them that .
the pizza was super healthy with lots of vegetables and delicious sauce .
the good news was , they have a huge patio to hang out on .
we ordered our meals and a side of their sweet potato fries to share .
food is good and reasonably priced .
all the staff was very pleasant and friend .
the prices are too high for the food they serve .
when we asked for some explanation of menu items , the waiter acted like we were stupid .
everything from the brick walls to the giant round balls of light hanging from the ceiling make carbon bar unique .
only thing i was n't a fan of was the macaroni salad , but i do n't enjoy mayo based salads anyway .
this place is always busy , so my fiancé and i were pleased that we were able to get in easily on a wednesday evening so we could celebrate my birthday with a good meal and a cocktail .
definitely a bad experience at this location after hours . i waited in line for 10 minutes to get cold curly fries and a horrible tasting drink smh .
the presentation was great , which made the actual taste of the food disappointing . the bacon was way too crispy and burnt and the potatoes were very near inedible .
if you 're a total rewards member , the cost is only $ 45 per person , so definitely sign up for that too !
unfortunately i did not like it and ordered a bottled domestic .
i 've been coming to oreganos for a couple of years now and i am always happy with my food !
in their defense , the bottled beer was good .
it 's a bit tacky , but not overwhelming .
the smoked salmon was really salty and overpowering for the combined ingredients and my husbands was tasteless and dry .
price was very reasonable .
good but not typical pizza . looks blackened but not burnt taste .
i found that having ripped wallpaper in the halls and the design around the room outdated .
that matters to me , i ca n't handle bright lights or loud noises .
i had nothing to drink and paid the high price of $ 3 for a 2 liter and they forgot it .
they have a couple of decent dishes , but most of it what you would expect for a $ 14 lunch buffet .
the sandwich was very tasteless , unless you count the nasty bagged lettuce taste when you take a bite .
the salsas are really good especially the green one . food is fresh and tasty .
the crab cake was huge !
we are new in town , and used yelp to help us find something that was open late , and had good reviews.. love the low key environment here .
it was spicy , full of flavor & delicious . next time , i 'm trying the chicken tikka ...
the only awkward part was the ambiance .
but the food is great and reasonable priced .
the only thing that was even remotely warm was the little fried won ton things , crab rangoon ?
so authentic , tasty , flavorful and fresh !
it is like a long hallway . this place should be called , `` starbucks express '' because there is not a single chair or table in the place , and it is literally a , `` get your coffee and get out '' kind of place .
only thing was the seating this time , i felt the lighting was terrible , like i was in an interrogation room .
yes it 's outdated ; there 's no tablecloths or fine china .
the lighting was harsh and the whole time i felt like i was in a cafeteria .
not sure where they were actually making the drinks but at least they are open and the views are stunning .
from the outside it 's quite funny because it 's very industrial looking and it 's on a street filled with nothing but strip clubs .
the food was really good and reasonably priced for a healthy option .
everything here was mediocre . bread was dry and flavorless .
i will definitely be getting this for lunch again while working since it is right across the street .
i think this is pretty reasonable for a high end steakhouse .
fresh , quick and decently priced .
management here seems to know how to pick and train quality staff . would totally recommend this place to anyone .
the inside of the restaurant is n't anything to special -- a couple of tables , bar seating , and a tv that was playing the world cup .
the only problem is that is high on fat and you have to wait 15-20 mins to start eating .
the food was fabulous . the chicken marsala was great and the portions were huge .
it is more expensive for very little quantity .
it is more expensive , but you get what you pay for .
i ordered a chicken burrito with rice and beans . the chicken was like those frozen chicken strips you get at safeway , the sauce was tasteless and the rice and beans the same .
i had a cava ( the only bubbly by the glass .
great atmosphere inside . plenty of space to sit and relax with family and friends .
now , the rooms ... uh , ugly , small , dull .
prices are on the high side , too .
$ 8 for a burger and it was microwaved ! - seriously bun and lettuce hot - 1/2 the cheese stuck to the paper .
the sushi was warm and the seaweed was chewy . the flavor was way too fishy .
you seriously just lost business and it would 've taken you two seconds to call me and tell me that you did n't have what i ordered .
beer selection was large however , so i 'm sure beer drinkers enjoy that . i do not really drink beer though .
such a bad location .
i usually get a beer and as much as i enjoy a cold mug of beer i do wish i could get a cold pint glass of beer .
wine by the glass selection is good . the service is sloooooow .
they did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it 's not all about crappy beer .
these two very small plates were $ 32.00 way to expensive for the quality .
i asked about their delivery area and i was told that if you buy a minimum of $ 40.00 worth of food they will deliver anywhere in las vegas for only a $ 2.50 delivery fee .
even their deserts tasted like shit .
my only complaint is the music is a bit loud but it 's in español so it still gets the full 5 stars !
try the crispy shrimp ( fried shrimp wrapped in potatoes ) , it is delicious and creative .
the decor was very simple yet effective in giving that `` wow '' factor .
my champagne glass was always filled as service was very attentive .
super quick and fast service ! the worker was spot on and super friendly !
the building is absolutely beautiful .
20 % of a normal $ 5 is ok , but 20 % of $ 75 is probably why they 're smiling .
at least the beer was decent .
our bill was incorrect , we ordered appetizers that were listed on the menu as 1/2 off during happy hour but when i asked the waiter why they were full price on the bill he said that the menu was outdated and never offered to tell us that or fix the bill .
what happened to the place that i once loved to go almost every friday for happy hour and spent many a saturday evenings enjoying myself with friends ?
for the price you pay , the taste was mediocre at best .
our bartender was amazing and incredibly knowledgeable .
we spend over $ 100 for lunch for this tasteless food .
we sat outside and the atmosphere was great . service was attentive without being overbearing and the food came out promptly and perfectly cooked .
this is a crowded , noisy ( because of the windows and wood floors ) environment , so if you 're looking for intimate and romantic , try someplace else .
great drinks too . i recommend the bellini !
decor inside is pretty neat and unique .
the bar is a very enjoyable experience food , 90s music and all .
i did have a `` buy one 6 inch get one free with a drink '' and it came to $ 6 .
not really expensive but a good price .
wine list was good ... had our favorites .
terrible registration service right . 25 guests and only 3 staffers .
highly recommend this place !
excellent place to have food . i go there more then often and all my friends from non persian origin were introduced to food here and love it .
there 's animal heads on the wall but it does n't feel creepy .
people are so gullible to put up with the unpleasant loud music and oppressive darkness and , no it 's not ok to use your cell phone flash light because it 's painful for those who have been in the darkness awhile .
this is a huge plus ! prices are decent .
a meal you can count on ! this is place is somewhere you go when you crave being satisfied .
the price is pretty good too .
prices are very reasonable for both food and drinks .
he has a great selection of wines , we choose the chianti that our waiter suggested which was smooth and flavorful .
the tiramisu was the favorite of the group by far , but the items were all quite good .
i got the beef noodles and it was good would have been better if it was more spicy .
the pork chop was season well and served kind of lukewarm - it came so quick , it looked like it was on a warmer .
the price is pretty good and it is delicious too .
the covered street fair and rock bands just outside the casino were great free fun between craps and one armed bandit play .
i do n't mind eating at expensive restaurants , but i hate being nickle and dimed for my food at these places . i want a meal , not a small piece of meat when i 'm paying $ 200 for 2 people .
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
at $ 10 a platform for brunch , out meal was actually really reasonably priced .
highly recommend this place .
the draft beer selection was lacking but the bottle service was awesome .
prices are very fair .
actually it was one of the worst , period .
i did n't drink but the bottles and canned beer , as well as the wine , selection looked nice as well .
tacky , but honestly , i think it 's amusing and gives it character .
16 a person seems like a good deal to me .
we also had a few well drinks on happy hour special and the margarita that was on happy hour special .
the bartender was friendly and made a great suggestion on a house margarita .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
we ordered bottled beers -- their beer selection is good , i will give them that .
loved the side dishes .
only shining star was the decor .
the cost of the buffet is not cheap and the place is becoming less and less impressive .
the beer was fine , and if i had known the dos equis was only 3 dollars a bottle i would have stuck with that rather than the negra modelo .
the wait staff practically bullied us to order some wine . different people , including the owner , kept coming to our table and abruptly asking , `` what are you drinking ? ''
the coffee cup is located in a very cute area in boulder city , like an old main street !
and , there 's good music playing , too .
the one thing i thought a little unusual was that they served beer , had a couple of taps and some bottled craft beers listed on a chalkboard .
the staff was nice and helpful .
the greens were tasty but the crispy chicken sitting and getting soggy in a pool of the liquor from the greens was weirdly unappetizing .
i highly recommend this place for anyone !
we had the two piece cod special instead which was just ok. easy to find better elsewhere . they did give us 3 pieces of fish for the 2 piece price .
instead of being just cheese on 1/4 , and all toppings on the remaining 3/4 , it was all toppings on all , but only using 1/4 the amount of normal cheese .
the choice and style of meats to choose from are exceptional .
very expensive for what you get . $ 13.00 for a veal on a bun with no drink or anything else .
place was packed but service was great and fast .
maybe it was that it did n't taste as authentic to me .
i tried a few beers ( a strawberry one and a peach variety ) that were delicious .
the food is fresh and delicious .
parking is a pain in the a** the escalator is kind of scary due to the sideways movement ... and they 're actually really ugly .
there were only 4 different options for the 10 dollar bottles , but honestly , who can complain at that price ?
again , fries have to be crispy , and especially when they are literally buried in a ton of tasteless nacho cheese , sour cream and whatever else was on them .
add one of their margaritas and this made for the perfect early evening meals !
that is trashy and if you ca n't get an order right find another job this is pathetic ! do .
so happy this is right down the street from our house !
it was tasteless , plain , and the consistency was a little off .
pretty nice cafe . spacious interior , good food and coffee drinks .
the bathroom is kinda shabby and could use good cleaning .
i 'm not sure what the magic ingredient is to achieving a `` retro '' rather than `` old and neglected '' ambiance , but fresh floor tiles ( or , you know , something sensible like laminate ) and seat cushions that are not held together by duct tape would be a start .
the service was great . the staff was friendly and quick to please .
there was a good selection of wine , beer , and cocktails as well . all of our food contained amazing and unique flavours .
$ 80 total meal for 2 people and it was terrible .
and if the game gets boring , go play some pool !
i was studying with my bf but then we ordered chicken basil and it was raw .
the price is a good value for what you receive .
i used to go here 2-3 times a week and always had great service and food .
probably my new favorite summer whiskey drink !
be prepared to drop some $ $ $ but in my opinion this place is nearly as good as it can get .
no lie . im not saying that cause they were hard to eat , no .
$ 14 dollars for three florets of cauliflower that we waited 35 minutes for just is n't okay . follow that up with half a cup of cold peas we paid $ 13 , burnt gratin for $ 14 and a small piece of steak for $ 36 and you get one giant rip off that 's simply not worth the price .
it 's frustrating to pay $ 20+ for an entree that i could buy for $ 6 at a mall , plus paying $ 3 for a soda .
the place is a good size and the prices are fair .
but not in a stuffy or silly way .
it was a drab design with pretty pathetic food .
we did order some margaritas and again they were n't bad just your typical margarita .
great service , lots of food and fast . good combination plates and variety to choose from .
i dined here with some friends this past weekend . i have celiac and one of my friends is 7 months pregnant , so needless to say we had some dietary restrictions .
seriously , with a $ 75 check average , fix your a/c .
they had a great happy hour and good drinks .
not a good place for wine , but about 30 draft beers .
we three girls shared the tropical goblet , which was absolutely delicious .
the owner is friendly and is always willing to talk about the food , and how she makes it . if you 're in the area , it 's a definite visit .
they were good , but the chicken was tough . '' the pad see yew was good , but only had three small pieces of broccoli .
okay ... not the biggest fan of the crab puffs because they are a little sweet but it they are still good .
this is my new hot spot to hang out with girls . i love the interior , lighting and music videos .
food was pretty good but not for the price . price was outrageous .
i enjoyed a glass of red wine , during happy hour so it was reasonable and yummy !
also , the sauce was cold and with no microwave available , it significantly cooled down the padthai .
i paid somewhere in the mid $ 70 's and was pretty surprised .
prices are reasonable too .
there 's no hard liquor , just beer and wine .
it was bad enough they got my order wrong , i found hair in my first slice of pizza . i was so disgusted , i threw all my pizza away !
i had the gnudi dish and it was phenomenal ( very rich ) .
but at least the food was still hot when i got it and not too cold .
after she finally deigned to acknowledge us we ordered our drinks , worst mistake of the night !
i ca n't pinpoint it , unless it 's just that hotel bars swarmed with people wearing name badges are low key depressing .
the chicken was almost decent .
for less than $ 15 it 's pretty tough to get lobster anywhere in this city albeit it 's not full pound lobster .
as mentioned in all the other reviews , the building is beautiful .
not a bad price for the amount of food you get .
the beer list was disappointing .
the salsas are all good , especially the green tomatillo variety . i love their mini chimichangas and enchiladas .
everything was cooked very well , seasoned well without being overly salty , perfect texture on the asparagus -- and a good amount of crab in the risotto .
but b4 dessert the entrees are family style and they all are delicious .
they have a full bar with decent selection of beers on tap , by the bottle and wine .
this is my favorite poke spot in the city - the only place i will come to for poke .
their happy hour cocktail offerings were good deals ( try the pisco sour cocktail ) .
the house rosé refreshing and well chosen .
i had the pork barbecue with 2 sides and it was delicious and smoked to perfection . i highly recommend trying the pecan pie for dessert , which was a slice of heaven & homemade !
the only not great thing was the margarita which seemed over-priced with a poor pour of tequila .
the coffee drinks are great , and i 'm particularly a fan of the boozy affogato ( coffee w/ gelato w/ alcohol ! )
the food is reasonably priced and tasty .
the food was great , but there was definite communication errors between us and our server .
the prices are very reasonable .
food was okay . to the staff : 1 ) if it is happy hour let me know when i order and could have saved a little money .
even though i was not drinking this time , i could not help but notice the excellent selection of draft beers .
decent prices and food .
not a huge fan of frosty glasses for craft beer , but it was n't so bad that there was an iceberg floating in my beer or anything .
it looks cooked mostly through ( and i 'm certainly not scared of a little pink ) but the inside is cold and mushy and a horrible texture , like semi raw i guess .
we also had a couple of bottles of wine suggested by the bartender tara and everything tasted delightful .
we asked what was in the margaritas as in what kind of tequila and the bartender responded `` everything is tequila based like every margarita '' .
they do n't serve hard alcohol but have beer and wine .
ordered a bunch of stuff , only thing that 's decent was the steak and tsao chicken . even then , the rice that came with the chicken was super stale and hard to chew .
however , the beer was good . they poured a good beer .
we had ... tarragon bison tongue ... amazing , the sauce that it is in has some really distinct flavours .
i love the swings at the bar .
there was n't much of a tap selection . also i do n't know if we picked 6 bad beers or if the taps were bad but none of the beers were good .
i think it was around $ 55 for 3 people for dinner , which is n't bad .
considering how expensive it is to purchase rib cap in the store , if you can find it , $ 70 for a succulent 8 oz .
the salads were 19 dollar and so mediocre .
nice to have craft beer on tap and bottle . should n't be in a chilled glass though .
waited probably 5 minutes and no one ever showed to even welcome us !
good pizza at a fair price .
one star off because , while it is a nice romantic setting , the lighting in there was way too dim to read the menu . i 'm in my 20 's and my eyesight is fine but i do n't think it would hurt to turn the lights over the tables up a little bit .
it was too expensive , i paid $ 21 .
the atmosphere of the restaurant is awesome .
price averages out since it is a bit more expensive as well .
it was nice that they had draft beer .
love having an entire section to yourself , its private , it just makes the entire atmosphere .
some dishes seem to be quite good tho like the fungus dessert dish , and 1 of the cold noodle dishes .
the atmosphere was good and the setting and decoration inside was comfy and homy .
tip : make sure to ask the waiter to change the grill when it 's dirty !
however , i was surprised that the hot and sour soup was actually not bad ... .not good ... .but not bad .
i also had the lobster roll ... .yummy ! the bun was perfectly toasted and buttered and the lobster , served warm as i like it , had such great flavor .
the ingredients all work beautifully together and there were no bites that seemed to be lacking components .
this is such a fun , quirky little place .
everything on that dish was good : the cole slaw , the corn bread !
i had the chicken picado pita ... a fresh , hot , thick , perfect pita piled with delish grilled chicken , peppers , onions , and jalapenos ... top it with the tzatziki ... you do n't get much better than that .
we made it during their happy hour which provided a good deal on some of the cuts of meat , some sides , and some drinks including beer and sake .
bottom line , it was a good experience . lots of space , good service , cheap drinks for uptown , and it was clean with some great music going on but not overwhelming .
approximately 15 minutes went by and we were ready to order and no waiter to be found .
the inside area is great too .
my drink was refreshing and herbaceous .
i think the interior is ugly .
the layout is almost uncomfortable and haphazard in a neat and orderly way somehow .
the price is good .
the portion sizes are generous and the presentation excellent .
great food and wine . a must try for anyone looking for a great dining experience .
its a nice sit down spot , and i love the location , but a few notes : - service is n't good .
fantastic place right on the canal . perfect shaded patio with umbrellas and greenery everywhere you look .
this is the best chicken ever . the wings are amazing and the frites are super good .
and it 's quick ( and cheap ) .
their location is a favorite go to spot . it 's close to work so i enjoy this place frequently .
i ca n't seem to understand what is wrong but everything tastes so plain ; the seaweed salad , hamachi ... sometimes the rice tastes downright awful or overloaded .
customer service it 's horrible , staff is rude and slow .
the food came out super fast and the portions were wild . i had the combo deal and got 4 entrees and it was enormous .
food was still mediocre to yucky .
the workers and management here have always been super nice ... which is rare in the chapel hill area .
i really love this place !
just wish they were more attentive to my wine glass .
service was terrible , and the food did not justify the price . we paid over $ 300 and this was not worth it .
over all it is a nice , all be it , very darkly lit sushi restaurant to sit in , with football playing for those interested .
the patio is impressive and big .
seemed like a trap to buy more expensive `` fresh rolls '' for $ 5.95 .
but it is never good when you leave a buffet that is $ 41 per person and you think to yourself i would have rather had a happy meal .
my flatbread came out what seemed like an hour after i ordered , and the it was very bland , had little flavor , and was lukewarm . i could not even taste the pesto , and the chicken itself was very dry .
the hot asparagus dip is tasty and plentiful , and the pita bread perfectly cooked .
it took a fair amount of time to put ours together as i walked in off the street so i would recommend calling ahead .
drinks were awesome , loaded with alcohol and definitely worth the money .
so we basically spent $ 30 on an entree that should have only cost $ 18 .
the injera was dry and had a weird aftertaste .
called in a pick up at 4:30. got there at 4:45 waited till 5:00 to get it . food was very good but the timing has to improve .
the fish is fresh , and the rolls are creative .
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
such a good view of the bow river , i absolutely loved the patio setting . 10/10 would always recommend .
also we tried to order dos equis on draft but there was something wrong with the tap that made it taste like a completely different beer .
it is a fairly loud environment , so if you 're looking for a quiet library setting you wo n't find that here .
the drinks were tasty , but not strong and in teeny glasses .
for the premium prices charged , i expected something incredible .
prices were very reasonable .
food tasted so bad .
the negatives , they charge $ 2 for a slice of cheese and the sandwich is pretty small .
johnny mulls is just the most delicious bbq ive ever had . i ordered the 3 meal combo should of ordered extra corn bread .
also , the prices were pretty good
the only thing that saved it was the decor inside .
i went with a friend for dinner , we shared the pad thai and coconut curry and they were both very tasty and satisfying . leave room for desert , the cheesecake was possibly the best i 've ever had anywhere !
horrible customer service . horrible business practice .
sammi 's place was really cute and casual from the outside and it caught my friends and my attention .
not to mention , at a reasonable price .
love the vibe of the restaurant too .
good wine list as well !
it was simply okay . the chicken that i ordered did n't seem all the way done , but perhaps it was a fluke ?
but the beer was disappointing .
the duck and chicken was terrible , and tasted like microwave leftovers .
the staff is not terribly friendly and the hamburgers are okay , but at $ 7+ they are expensive for what you receive .
inside : nice place not a lot of wall decor .
i am not vegetarian , but i am sensitive to it for others , as perhaps they should be too . extreme gross .
for $ 14 it should have been amazing , but it was n't .
the cocktail menu is endless and definitely a highlight of the place , but do n't underestimate the wine list that was hand-picked by their sommelier .
i ordered a lychee saketini . i do n't like sake , but i love lychees .
as for sides , the dishes came with savory corn on the cob and a coleslaw that was remarkable .
menu is diverse and plating is spectacular .
i highly recommend trying this location .
house wine was $ 4 and the bartender poured generously . nice ambiance .
you will not be sorry !
it 's pricey ( think $ 180 for 6 people ) but everything tasted wonderful .
the crepes are so delicious , and we love sitting outside on the patio to eat .
i really do n't like the fluorescent lighting though . thats the only thing i would change .
ok sushi at best . prices are pretty average so that 's a plus .
i usually dont like meat on pizza and bell peppers ever , but this worked magic delicious pizza heaven .
the restaurant itself is a bit loud so if you are looking for a quiet evening this is not your place .
unfortunately , i do n't drink beer .
very happy to have this little gem in henderson !
amazing food at amazing prices , about $ 15 per person .
the beers were ok , nothing special .
and perfect for sitting out on that patio .
it is outstanding and the prices are very reasonable .
the fried rice was interesting ( rice and soy sauce ) and okay but only okay .
sat at the bar , ordered a cold negro modelo - they only offer it on draft .
the chambord marg is a perfect go-to , although their drink book is filled with fresh , tasty , unique cocktails !
i was disappointed at the customer service to the poolside mannerism of the staff .
you can enjoy a meal for only $ 25 for 2 persons .
i will also go as far to say that the south sea fish tacos are the best fish tacos i have ever had .
the only knock is that there was no beer on tap ; bottle selection was good though .
not a huge fan of frosty glasses for craft beer , but it was n't so bad that there was an iceberg floating in my beer or anything .
nice atmosphere , some outside seating ( with a view of the parking lot ) .
good food , good price .
$ 50 a person ! wow .
i ordered the chicken chimichanga and loved it ! the rice that came with it was delicious too !
they make my dishes perfectly mild - i 'm a spice wimp but i love indian flavors so it 's hard to me to find places that cater to my sensitive taste buds .
prices are very reasonable .
many seafood & few meat selections and you can also make your own dipping sauce , which is nice .
i tried the salmon special , which was cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection .
the prices are very reasonable priced for the portion size and quality .
for those dining-in , the interior is impressive and much resembles that of a sports bar .
pad thai was tasteless , i ordered some rolls which never got put in , so we never got them . too many servers for our table , which i 'm sure was the mix up for the egg rolls .
it 's not uncommon for total strangers to just strike up a random conversation .
awesome view with music to match . dancing rooftop at the rio hotel is always a lot of fun their drinks are good but like any hotel expensive
the wedding soup is delicious ! lots of goodies and the broth is not greasy .
me and my boyfriend came here on a friday night around 7 and it was pretty busy .
i never have to force myself to drink anything with tequila in it , but their house margarita just did n't taste right .
or could have shelled out some more $ $ for a high end restaurant on the strip or in the luxury casinos they have here .
hardly any basil or garlic on it and no oregano at all and they could have let it cook a little longer so it was n't so soggy .
it was $ 9.75 plus tax for a very mediocre meal from a storefront restaurant .
nice little place with good prices .
if you were interested in having a conversation anywhere inside ( even separated from karaoke as we were ) , you pretty much had to yell .
awesome food , good prices and portions . i recommend the cantonese fried rice and bbq pork
our server was fantastic , she had a great personality and was really on point with recommendations .
wait staff and owner have been very friendly and helpful in suggesting dishes to try .
they were terrible and that 's not the vibe of a car wash ... not worth the $ 50 tab .
like for real , it 's almost creepy .
the beer is cold and i have mixed drinks about feelings .
i believe my total came out to be $ 13 .
i am a sucker for a good mojito . i heard they had good mojitos so i made a trip .
the tofu inside was moldy and overall it was just a terrible dish . the meat was tough .
i did not try any sauce as there were only two soy-free options , and one was really spicy and the other had coconut ( which i ca n't have either ) .
good selection of beer , wine ... not at all .
service was fine and the atmosphere is cute .
keep up the good work .
beer was nice big but no cold glass .
on a fun note , the door reads `` classy af , '' the rest ?
it 's not cost prohibitive ( cheaper than starbucks ) , and it 's simply lovely .
the restaurant is clean and bright with a spacious main dinning area with a choice of booths or tables . we chose to dine in the adjoining sun room with large windows that provide a nice view of a stream and woods .
first , the location is very clean .
drink special for an hour was nice .
like the dark knight ; ) you know what i mean !
great people working behind the counter , fast , proficient , kind and courteous !
still , it was good , and reasonably priced .
i had the tommy 's tumeric margarita . an amazing drink with infused tea cuts the alcohol flavor .
drinks were average ... i had a couple skinny margs and they tasted pretty watered down , nothing special .
it just did n't taste what you would expect a bowl of authentic pho to taste like .
they have a pretty good beer list , though nothing on draft .
you know the food , service , staff , decor ( filled with old school harley 's ) and other motorcycle related paraphernalia is great .
prior to tonight , i called the listed number for bottle service only to have the gentleman have a screaming baby in the background tell me that he was n't the right person and he 'd text me the number to the right person when we hung up .
the salads pecan is a special return favorite and she gets savannah chopped salad .
prices are very reasonable here .
finally there 's someone who is really nice but then the food was unacceptable ... ..
service is very attentive too !
doing a great job !
this place is a great find .
service was fantastic and the sushi chefs really know their stuff .
love the sandwiches here . delivery is insanely fast , they use great meats and breads and even their potato salad is amazing .
there are enclosed canopies that if i were sitting in would feel kind of weird and stuffy .
we had everything from pizza to burgers to fish and everything was so good .
night before thanksgiving , and the service from kelli and whitney was excellent .
the floors were also dirty in the everywhere . the bathroom was disgusting too .
6 beers on tap and only one watered down version if a beer , so that 's a plus .
great wall art that makes you feel like your actually in new york , perfect for selfies .
now , the chicken is torn stringy strips of plain white meat chicken that tasted baked , with no wok sear or flavor .
the wok and chicken was room temperature ( not hot ) and the taste as a bit bland .
great place to visit ! has a nice `` old time '' atmoshpere .
it did feel like she was working too many tables to be able to provide good service .
i ordered the chicken marsala and it was awful !
nice wine selection too .
it was a beautiful sunny day in the 70 's to eat outdoors by the lake .
we did order some margaritas and again they were n't bad just your typical margarita .
this place is pretty price , my check was $ 30 before tip .
it 's really cheap and the food is really good .
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
no stories , no wacky convo 's , no random encounters with strangers .
i also had a great fish dish .
they have a small patio overlooking the street and comfortable booths inside .
this place is definitely great for groups with the outdoor games .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
the staff is also very kind and accommodating .
the lunch buffet was really good - excellent variety . it was all tasty , but i think their cooks ' specialties must be the vegetarian stuff .
sadly they did n't offer any hard cider , but a friend was happy with the beer on tap .
( heads up ) the beat it cold pressed juice was also perfectly balanced , refreshing and made the cells dance .
fries were bland would n't order again .
i paid for shrimp and chicken , not a cheaper dish .
our server was very friendly .
one pool is heated and two smaller jacuzzis are too but the nice shallow pool with the waterfall is freezing cold !
price : very reasonable price , the curry is about $ 10 , huge portion .
service is good , prices are reasonable .
they 're good for a late night spot and all the prices are pretty cheap .
do not recommend it . bathrooms very dirty looked like someone threw up in the men 's sink .
the only seafood for lunch was shrimp and mussels .
i would say its a little tacky but clean .
love that it 's a small and intimate venue .
everything is reasonably priced for the area .
i love this place .
lots of different shrimp options .
they also offer two free appetizers during their soft opening , which are also very delicious snacks .
i love this place !
the pricing is very reasonable for the quality of the food also .
only $ 10 bucks ! - not bad , right ?
the staff was a tad on the rude side arrogantly telling us that chairs at the bar ( albeit unused ) could not be used .
decent service just wasn`t expecting to spend $ 100+ on wings and 2 pizzas .
unfortunately , no bud light lime on tap so we just drank regular beer .
the chili is thick , tasty and unique .
the atmosphere is both casual and comfortable
also the bathroom stinks and is kinda dirty .
the price was expensive .
we stopped in for a late lunch on sunday .
the atmosphere is nice , though be careful if you get a high-top table near the bar .
unique , delicious and beautifully plated dishes .
the wild rice went perfectly with the salmon .
their hot is hot !
they do have an amazing wine selection .
the seafood and meat options were not good whatsoever . very disappointing .
bar has a nice vibe the guys behind the bar were very nice as well .
filthy ! there is no reason a `` hole in the wall '' restaurant needs to be dirty ... the floors , the tables , the walls , the stained ceiling !
good selection of beer and helpful bartender . unfortunately , they 'd just tapped out 2 of the 3 beers we chose .
i had the pleasure of being served by jared who told us about the happy hour deals , $ 5 for a pint , pitcher ( beer ) , wine or coolers before 5 p.m. which it was .
the restaurant had a weird odour and the furniture and decor looked dated .
price for two ppl under $ 40 bucks is very good
needless to say , i will not be returning to either place .
we started with a cheese plate ( great munchies for the four of us ) . i also got 2 miller lites , as they were 2.50 ( score ! )
very cool location , great people watching on the patio .
the beer selection was n't bad .
i hate giving bad reviews , but this place was a complete disappointment .
it was okay , but had a gritty texture ... to each their own though .
it 's outrageously good .
on the expensive side , but you get what you pay for .
that in of itself is not a bad thing really , and probably part of the charm , but its painted gray and looks depressing .
i 've honestly never had anything like it before but the service was just slow , and i could n't be mad at that poor girl basically working the restaurant by herself .
it is like going to a 5 star restaurant but without the high cost .
the service is okay ... the atmosphere is nice , but nothing special ( unless it 's a nice summer day and you can sit on their patio ) .
good happy hour specials on drinks ( half off pitcher of mojito is my favorite ) .
however they offer a happy hour on well drinks and draft beers but their draft beer wasnt working and they dont offer bottles in substitution so that was kind of disappointing .
all their sandwiches are delicious .
the prices are great too .
in la , this would have easily cost 40 bucks .
this restaurant is fabulous for many reasons .
they told me i could n't get a to go order ( i 'm sorry , what ? )
too expensive for average food and drinks .
i love this place ! never too packed , always great service .
beautiful decor and food was delicious !
and great prices too .
i 'd highly recommend coquine .
béchamel was close to tasteless .
love their sake and beer as well .
the restaurant was 3/4 empty so i do n't see why they had to force us to share just one . this meant that we could only try one type of fondue at a time .
the music was loud so conversation was limited but good food .
good selection of food and wine .
prices are very reasonable , but not cheap .
the baked goat cheese appetizer was incredible and i highly recommend it !
not 100 % on the name of the pitcher we order for drinks but i believe it was on a special drinks menu and it involved dragonfruit ( kinky something ) recommend by our waitress .
pricing is definitely good .
good selection of beer , wine ... not at all .
and prices are good too .
the place is amazing , i 'm going here every time i 'm in the area .
they kept arguing with her and told her that we are too far away .
i even eat the crust , it 's so delicious . and i never eat the crust .
the only reason i am giving them 2 stars is because the interior was visually interesting with exposed brick and the music was n't awful .
wayy too many lights , went blind while eating .
awesome place ! the cocktails are out of this world ( not to mention an extensive list ) .
( what is wrong with sound absorbing ceilings , so seldom seen in toronto ? )
sorry to say , it looked better than it tasted .
and suggested a delicious bottle of wine that paired nicely with our meal .
i highly recommend this place .
the bartender was really nice and engaging and she did n't skimp on the alcohol in the drinks .
the lunch prices are very reasonable .
not impressed . it was watery and just was not delicious like i was hoping for .
delicious with a reasonable price .
only concern is that the bathroom looks a little rundown .
that 's pretty damn reasonable .
however , if this place does not pick up the pace then they could potentially lose customers .
the only thing i was n't into was the decor , i can see the charm in it but it felt dusty and old without charm .
the burgers are creative and more than filling .
price is more than fair and the environment is very friendly .
this place is at the base of south mountain . this restaurant has a great ambiance and fabulous views of the mountain and the city .
sam and maddie were so nice and very knowledgeable .
reasonably priced and good location on the strip .
the outdoor pool looked nice , but i did n't get in .
the ceiling was leaking water , ventilation was crap , floors in the room were stained and nasty , and it 's a damn maze just to find your room .
it would be amazing with some vodka .
the service is good . prices are reasonable .
prices might 've increased a little since then , but mine came out to $ 6.49 with tax ( pretty reasonable for airport food if you ask me ) .
i only eat at this carrabba 's because i hate their newer restaurants ' layouts , and this location also has plants on the roof which makes it very unique .
but , unfortunately i am pretty sure they ended up charging us for it .
we thought that the food was very bland ( like you would expect to find at a hospital ) .
i got the belvedere vodka with mine and it was refreshing .
they are attentive and work hard to make sure you are having a good time .
the manager is always courteous and thoughtful , but his staff is always terrible .
their drinks are great and handcrafted as well as they have some very good wine .
from the outside the business does n't look too impressive but in the inside it is very spacious , modern looking and was pretty crowded during lunch time .
i 've only been here twice , but i already love it !
margarita tasted good , but was a little weak , i stuck to beer after having one .
st francis is a two story inside/outside restaurant right off camelback , super cute trendy place .
the inside is decorated pretty cool .
excellent wine cellar , with red wine served at the appropriate temperature for once ( cellar cool ) .
it was kind of a mess honestly .
i was very impressed and plan on making this a common lunch stop .
you do n't need to be able to see every inch of it , but it 's a little weird to have creepy bathroom mood lighting .
we also tried the atlantic salmon fillet ( awesome ) and new york strip ( awesome ) for the second course and a couple of sides .
tap water there is terrible but is kind of necessary when drinking cocktails .
i was underwhelmed with the decor and dirty windows besides all of that lets talk about the food .
i 'm not sure if that 's how it is or the company did n't pay for anything more .
charging full price for kids over age 2 is ridiculous . food is ok , but waiting lines and price is too much for what is offered .
the services is fantastic , the staff and management are very friendly .
lost of different beers on tap and even more in the bottle for you beer drinkers .
that thing was loaded down with ingredients and the bread was amazing brioche bread .
sauce was just right .
accept cash only at the drink bar and issue a ticket for credit cards , accept drink orders at the register , add a register in this area ... something that 's not what i experienced .
lots of quality food for very reasonable price .
total ( not including tip ) was about $ 62 , a lil pricey but the food was great so we 'd definitely return .
the food was delicious and moderately priced .
it was very loud . the stained glass and pews were interesting , but the other random pictures on the walls did n't make sense .
it 's so awkward and uncomfortable and all conversation is obliterated by the sound .
cool atmosphere and good choice of music .
i would not only not recommend this place , i would persuade people against it .
i 'd recommend this place for a date night during the week or happy hour after work .
we asked what was in the margaritas as in what kind of tequila and the bartender responded `` everything is tequila based like every margarita '' .
the location and the views were beautiful , i just need a good reason to come here .
the fish is a good size and the prices are n't too high .
it is pretty good and fairly well priced .
however if you get 24 wings for $ 18 dollars you can only get two flavors !
really good food . unbelievably cheap prices .
it is such a nice and cozy place .
i do n't like having sloped walls or windows because it makes me feel claustrophobic .
small-ish portions ( for a pub ) but everything is delicious and reasonably priced .
they have a full bar with beers on tap with no drink or beer menu ?
amazing ( and strong ) !
prices are very reasonable .
they look incredible though and the loaves are all very dense .
the prices are good .
drinks were fine and they had a good selection of beers on tap .
the price is also very reasonable : )
the fish is very good but you must try the reuben sandwich .
unfortunately the food is pretty bland and the cleanliness is questionable ( food stains on the walls and room divider blinds and support columns ) .
thanks perkins for the horrible over priced meal i did n't order .
the bottled beer was nice and cold but my friend thought the tap beer was not nearly cold enough .
my omlet was awful and the manager never even stopped by our table .
good prices and not complaints .
seems crazy to spend $ 50 ( see number 2 ) and pay $ 5 for parking + tip for just over a half hour .
the entrance is kinda creepy , but whatever haha .
excellent value , especially for lunch specials . good food , friendly service , low prices .
overall great food at a very reasonable price .
not only did it taste bland , the beef was also overcooked so it was a bit tough .
wing night was a bust , they were flavorless and over fried , dry as a bone .
my last few trips to vegas i was n't able to experience that so i knew this would finally be the perfect opportunity .
entrees ranged in price from $ 15-25 and i felt like you got plenty of food and really good quality for what you paid .
however , the place is quite cheap .
nice bread selection at the table that came with this big crispy yummy parmesan chip .
strange , circular booths with plastic surrounding them in what seems like an attempt to be colorful , playful and modern but resulting in cheap and almost cheesy .
not a ton of variety but it 's not a bad thing .
the bartender did n't know the beers they had on tap and seemed pretty out of it .
best vegetarian indian food i have found in az . very fresh , amazing flavors .
not a bad bar .
ok one weird thing - in the men 's restroom is a urinal that looks like a horse trough .
the prices are reasonable .
this made it taste like i was eating nuts on bread which was n't terrible but i did n't ask for the recipe either .
wonderful teas , coffees and sweets , also . i 've tried most of their sandwiches and the shaved beet and honeyed goat cheese while although simple is perfectly executed and absolutely delicious .
this restaurant is just for pick up or delivery only but there is a table there in case u needed to eat there .
not only was it $ 28 per person for weekend dinner pricing but you also are required to add a soup base for additional $ 3-7 , even if you wanted a plain broth .
our server recommended non-alcoholic ginger beer , which turned out to be a very good choice . their house wine was very good according to my girlfriend .
it really is cool to see the fountain dancing to the music .
my favorite entree that i always get without fail are the mediterranean chicken pita tacos , they 're delicious , light and refreshing .
cost : somehow , with all this food and drinks , our bill was only around $ 33 !
i was so happy to find this place .
food is decent and drinks prices are ok as well .
the mens room had no paper towels and the women 's bathroom my wife said was so dirty with towels on the floor everywhere .
the shrimp and rice were lukewarm to almost cool . they also served everything on a cold plate .
i play a minimum $ 25 for good 4 hours in table games , buy in for around a total of $ 600 majority of the time .
all around nice meal and rather evenly priced for vegas with a meal for three including apps for just about $ 80 .
this is a membership only place ( $ 30 per year ) .
reasonable , though not dirt cheap , prices .
i was quiet , no signs of being drunk .
i 've eaten here 3 times already ! and i love it every time !
they also only have beer , no wine at all .
from the tremendous clutter of all the weird decor to some odd items like a statue of a topless women ?
they were dry as the desert and hard as rock .
you wo n't be disappointed .
the lighting could be better the stark light bulbs from home depot ceiling fans did n't work for me , an upgrade here could make the experience much better from the get-go .
well drinks are pretty weak , so i stick to beers .
beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor . or at least the menu was .
no hot water or paper towels , dirty , and down a sketchy hallway .
bland , tasteless , and super stingy ... a huge bun with small portion of meat and toppings .
i would say a fair price for the tiny bite is 50 cents .
the service was very slow and the server did n't know the difference between a draft and bottled beer .
there is outside seating perfect for those of you who travel with dogs .
awesome . he also through in the electric slide later for nostalgic purposes .
it 's older and seems wore out . what drove me crazy was how thin the walls are , i could hear phone conversations , toilets flushing , and the guy snoring all night .
every time i get triple j bbq , the service is great , meat is tender and the sauce is very unique , a sweet vinegar based sauce , which is something you do n't see very often .
the bottled beer was nice and cold but my friend thought the tap beer was not nearly cold enough .
it may be more expensive than other places but the quality is there .
the cold soba salad is perfect in every way .
prices fairly priced . recommend .
the prices are reasonable too .
the glass of prosecco was just the perfect amount of sweetness without being overbearing .
i had a vodka cucumber lemonade which was sweet and refreshing as well as a lemon drop martini .
not to cheap not to expensive .
their `` chilean sea bass '' was outstandingly moist and the vegetables were yummy !
i also ordered a few house margaritas on the rocks but unfortunately only `` frozen '' margaritas were part of happy hour .
veggies were not overcooked and tasted great too .
but still she was super annoyed we were there , which left us still confused if we were n't supposed to be there ?
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
my biggest problem was that the food was bland .
recommended a couple of drinks ; pink kiss & pineapple & sage mojito which were delicious !
i 've tried just about everything on the menu and all of it is super tasty and fresh . the kale chips are awesome !
they had the best omelette station , definitely worth waiting for . huge portions and perfectly cooked .
they only had three flavors of beer and all of them were unknown to a beer drinker .
the only reason to come is to drink beer out of the schooner glasses but alas they only have crap beer on tap .
kind of comes off tacky .
drinks were good & the bartender was sweet .
lovingly restored with original booths , counters , bar stools , and even the original wallpaper .
i was also totally weirded out that the bathroom had mirrored walls .
finally , the cocktails - i understand paying over $ 12 for a craft cocktail , but the fact we were charged $ 12.50 for jameson on the rocks is ridiculous .
the dancing was cool but very loud .
what a great place to eat !
its a cute concept but definitely too pricey to be a regular hangout spot .
there was only 2 other tables so it was not busy at all .
the decor is pleasant but the darkness in the restaurant ( 7:30pm ) , reading the menu requires night vision goggles and makes the decor nearly invisible to appreciate .
great food , but very loud . very hard to have a conversation so possibly not the best for a work meeting where you want to have a decent conversation .
the atmosphere is low lit , cozy , and clean .
( for the wine or our feedback : ) ) .
even one of the draft beers was bad !
not many beers on tap , but what they had were pretty good .
definitely go there for the food , not the ambiance . i went there a couple of weeks ago , and it was very noisy and has a rather awkward seating arrangement .
when we walked in , the establishment was dirty .
the shell is edible and similar to shrimp chips as far as taste ... .
did n't say : sorry , we do not have this , can we substitute this ?
my first time here and i loved it !
their balsamic chicken salad is my favorite !
the only redeeming factor is its average menu price .
i love this place and i ca n't thank the employees enough for the fast service . keep up the good work !
sadly , our take out experience was poor enough to warrant a review .
but the beer was disappointing .
they never compensate for anything . terrible service !
she begged and convinced me to get them anyway , since they would `` only take a minute '' .
lost of different beers on tap and even more in the bottle for you beer drinkers .
delicious and inexpensive sandwiches , what 's not to love ! the kalbi beef is my go-to .
price was around $ 50 , so it 's not that expensive considering this quality .
no music playing , no one talking , somewhat uncomfortable feeling .
all around a good spot .
the general meals are moderately priced however the taco tuesday deal is only $ 2 a taco and they 're delicious !
the men 's room was disgusting and out of towels .
we noticed that the décor seemed nicer ; the colors were more inviting and warmer ( and there was n't a bright fluorescent meat case ) .
it took forever for the food to arrive . once the food arrived , it was a wrong order .
breakfast and desserts are amazing .
it shares entrance space with richardson 's ( rokerij is on the right ) .
this was a great drink and loved the presentation . i also tried a mojito type whiskey drink which was very refreshing .
i loved this place , we got there and the bartender immediately came to us , she was super helpful and friendly and checked on us often throughout the night .
what a great place for friday night happy hour ! great martinis and complimentary sushi .
the prices are extremely fair .
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
the prices are fair as well .
her standards and attitude need some additional adjustments or maybe she needs some refresher training on how to clean glasses and how to serve wine .
people are so gullible to put up with the unpleasant loud music and oppressive darkness and , no it 's not ok to use your cell phone flash light because it 's painful for those who have been in the darkness awhile .
the paint on the walls did n't fucking match .
and the staff always has good energy .
for the high end prices , you get a less than mediocre experience .
the total bill was about $ 13.00 , but this was for a lot of food , looking at a food court .
so glad this spot opened uptown !
highly recommend if you are coming to town .
great food and very reasonably priced .
here 's some bullets : - hay shashimi tuna was delicious and interesting .
very cool , except when someone accidentally spills it all over the table .
had a good crisp to it .
it looks nice , but the set up was quite awkward .
it 's so fluorescent bright in there it feels like you 're being interrogated .
they also have a very big drink menu especially for beer and cocktail drinkers .
i normally do n't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature .
always a great time . keep up the great work .
and late night food . awesome place to stop by when you 're downtown lv .
i asked about beer selection and was disappointed that they only carried the standard domestics and imports .
the wines are all from ontario and we were both surprised to find one we liked during the $ 8 a glass after 8pm happy hour .
5 different people came to `` serve '' us and they still forgot to bring drinks , fajitas etc .
if you 're into overly crowded bars with terrible music playing too loud you might feel at home here . bonus if you like extremely dirty floors , bad drinks , and obnoxious drunk people ( aka the next case of lake erie shore ) .
ordered a philly cheese steak special they had going , and it was outstanding . home fries were great as well .
not a great experience at all and will not be returning as i said .
it has a lovely atmosphere with a fabulous owner .
place looks amazing . it is heaven for a sweet tooth people ... : - ) all the deserts are beautiful and tasty .
i 've always had great service and hot food here . i really love the guac tostada bites and the diablo chicken pasta .
really the only improvement would be if they put up some fabric decorations to dampen the sound inside .
the tacos were amazing and everything was so fresh .
frankly , they should be ashamed to even serve a piece of chicken like that .
$ 50 all you can drink house and only $ 75 for top shelf .
they also have a killer drink special .
the prices are slightly higher than haji ( i paid $ 5 and change for the sandwich alone ) but it was still a relatively good deal .
the bathroom hallway seemed a but spooky , but not too bad .
tip : caesars are pretty expensive here though - $ 15 !
the service was friendly and pretty quick .
staff was friendly and efficient and the restaurant was clean and inviting .
it was $ 40 dollars for lunch speical for 2 people and it did n't even taste good .
as for the drinks omg their wagyu infused old fashioned was strong yet smooth and had a very unique flavor because well duh they infuse the wagyu japanese whiskey in house themselves !
the service was rushed and was told not to order anything too complicated as everyone wants to go home .
very reasonable priced and their oxtail soup is to die for , very affordable at $ 10.99 !
it was n't even bottled , pretty sure it was tap .
prices very good as well .
the staff was very young , there were only two servers and they were both about 16 or 17. there was also another bus boy who was like 14 and took our drink order .
service was quick and attentive and the wine list looked good ( i only had one glass , but checked out the bottle offerings ) .
reasonable prices . good food .
i really enjoyed having a starbucks on the lower level and even a mcdonald 's for those tipsy nights .
to make the situation more confusing was the interior decor , it was very nostalgic .
great happy hour ... 7 days a week from 5-7pm at the bar . nice ambiance , nice bartenders , good drinks and yummy food all for $ 6 each .
it 's just not worth the frustration , especially with the high prices .
the service was slow and they seemed disorganized and confused from the moment we walked in the door .
the prices are more then i expected for a `` $ $ '' place but the quality justified it well .
i have been here a couple times and so far i am a fan .
the burger was pretty good and ca n't beat the price .
there are so many choices and as your eating more and different rolls and items including deserts keep getting added to the revolving belt . sushi was pretty good , and of course when your full a new roll comes around .
the flavor was wonderful and the chicken was moist and tender .
the food is great especially their beef samosa .
i liked how the chicken was not over breaded like some places and i could actually taste it .
the owner was very polite and attentive to all of the guest in the restaurant .
we highly recommend sitting out on the patio .
the thing that separates them is the service , from the managers steve o and marissa who treat both guest and customers with warmth and respect . as far as the servers they are the a1 top professionals , they know everyone by name and always say hello , this also includes the bar backs and kitchen workers .
there are some awesome summer happy hour specials with half off all wine , beer , and cocktails !
i think for the price i pay i get a more than fair plate .
someone finally came around and told us to sit wherever we would like .
we got 2 pizzas a lasagna , a fettuccini , and bacon wrapped scallops . scallops were extremely oily and came in a escargot plate for some reason , confused us a little.. pizza and pasta took longer than usual and when it finally came , pizza was okay , lasagna was too salty and the fettuccini was under cooked ... unfortunate experience .
i found cora 's to be bland and a few dollars per plate too expensive .
sushi is amazingly fresh , the volcano roll was spicy tuna , avocado in the roll , deep fried lightly then topped off with a mound spicy kani , cucumber , masago and spicy aioli .
i was also trippin ' that my hot latte came in a glass and not a ceramic mug .
apps and tacos were very good . fish taco was favorite .
also got a chambord margarita which was terrific !
the lobby was clean , bathroom was pretty dark and no toilet paper so they definitely need to keep an eye on that .
he brought out this cornbread which was the most delicious cornbread i may have ever eaten .
for only $ 5 you get an extremely good value .
this meal was only worthy for $ 5 at the most .
let 's just say if you want to get away and have a good time have some good food and watch the bull riding and enjoy the live music and dancing this is thee place . beautiful scenery and friendly atmosphere .
prices ok ... not ridiculous .
place is dark and trendy .
the lighting and decoration or lack of give a cold sterile atmosphere .
the welcoming staff , dim lights and display of artwork on the walls gives it a nice neighborhood ambiance .
the fact you can sit down and eat comfortably was nice .
it 's also a relatively quiet location which is nice .
really nice and remodeled inside .
a little yucky . we had 4 different dishes ... underwhelmed .
we both got burgers and i did n't think they were anything special ( mine was a little burnt too ) .
i finished my meal with a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie - which was easily one of the best cookies i 've ever had .
one of my favorite items on the menu are the fried mushrooms !
prices are really good for what you get .
they have great happy hour specials on food and drink .
scrambler 's is by far my favorite breakfast place and frequent them ( every saturday and sunday ) in the greater columbus area .
surprised that there were a few true craft beers ( in bottles , no taps ) .
the only thing preventing a 5 stat is the dated carpet and furniture .
the only thing that was kinda annoying was there were no lights in the bathroom .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
we only do wine and beer at the bar . ''
it was nice they offered avocado without an additional charge .
we also got milkshakes , which were alright ( kind of on the watery side ) .
food is reasonably priced .
possibly the worst dim sum experience i 've ever had . flavorless , the cheapest ingredients available , fatty , greasy , and to boot , the service was totally inattentive .
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
my husband and friend 's boyfriend had beer ; the beer selection was pretty limited so if you do n't like negro modelo i would stick to a cocktail or wine .
very reasonable prices . good food .
they could use a face lift , but the food makes up for the outdated interior .
not too sweet either .
not the greatest price point at a dollar a dumping , but totally worth a try .
the beer menu was pretty weak . they did n't have much on tap and the bottle selection was just as poor .
they free wine tasting on thursday , happy hour and good food .
prices are pretty cheap though !
prices are very reasonable .
no table cloths , fake candles on the table and a rest room that is like one in a applebee 's .
i 've been very pleased with their wine selection for both the glass and bottle .
i think it cost something like $ 4 ! what a bargain for sure !
sure they were good but $ 114 for 6 scallops is crazy .
very good with reasonable prices .
the food was old and cold .
i also ordered breadsticks and it was like they were microwaved with no butter or garlic on them at all.. really disappointing .
they also have decent house wine for $ 1 per ounce .
i had the pork belly buns for the first time and i seriously could n't believe how delicious it was ! i also recommend the green chili mac and cheese i get it every time has a little kick too .
we were the only people in the store when we ordered our food , then they told us their system was down .
if the staff at the front of the house could be trained better and not be a hassle to get their attention that would be great .
whether you are a tourist roaming the strip for good eats or a local in search of something delicious , fukuburger can fill that void .
we had the filet mignon sliders , baked brie , camarones a la diabla , and chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms .
one of my favorite places in vegas period .
our table was glad we came on a `` discounted '' meal .
i 'm quite glad to live close to this great little brunch place ( though they serve breakfast all day , which is always a gem to find ) .
while the ambiance is supposed to recreate an 'upscale ' fifties diner , it gets very loud , and the tables are a bit too claustrophobic .
it was made with very thick brioche bread , which was soaked just right and not dry or soggy .
the atmosphere is very modern , and usually pretty quiet . the staff are all very amiable and helpful whenever we 're there.. a great place for lunch and dinner !
when we asked the server for more , a woman named leilani claiming to be the manager , confronted us in the most outrageous , disrespectful manner .
great place ! i 'd highly recommend .
the food prices are n't the cheapest but the food is pretty good .
tons of places to sit inside and its super cozy .
great concept offering an assortment of meat balls from salmon to beef and vegetarian .
food was extremely good too and not greasy .
not at all . i 'm happy to drop $ 25+ on a smaller entree if the quality is there .
the beer list was disappointing .
the dishes are decently priced .
the portion sizes are good for the apps .
the cafe itself is quite tiny but cozy .
i was n't drinking but looked like a good beer selection .
habenero based with mango , it 's very hot but also very delicious .
i recommend the kind in a blunt with peppers and jalapenos !
only reviewing the drinks here- expensive and the margarita tasted like there was n't any tequila in it .
for me , the burger was just okay . it did n't have a good consistency and fell apart a little bit when i was eating it .
not much meat , small cold lumps , with with very little flavor .
you also have the option of eating closer to the floor in one of their traditional seating areas .
what a huge disappointment .
so the atmosphere is cool and the restaurant itself is well designed .
been here more than once ( obviously ) and each time i 'm here , the service is always nice , accommodating and helpful .
anyway the poutine tasted fine . just the place was not that satisfying .
overall it 's super cheap and pretty good .
dinner started off with meatballs as well as fried chicken .
lovely remodeled house with some great rooms to relax and do work if need be .
i 'm glad the waitress over came the bad first impression the hostess created when we first got there .
oh my goodness , the food is excellent ... .as if angels are walking across your tongue . fragrant , spicy , delicious !
the decor was a little minimalist - one nice accent wall , but then it looks like they ran out of money for decorations .
no draft beer - but they have a good bottle selection .
they could use a face lift , but the food makes up for the outdated interior .
aside from its decor , there 's not much memorable moments to comment about .
the decor is adorable , and the atmosphere is cozy and definitely encourages hanging out and chatting .
it was amazing and the strawberry basil lemonade was so original and refreshing !
you have a full bar with amazing drinks .
the sweet and attentive waiter brought a glass of a different wine , but it was n't much better .
i love this place but hate hate hate the crappie scribbled on walls for decor ... .
be brave and get the fried chicken benny or chicken and waffles . everything is super tasty anyway - the meatloaf is a fav also .
perfect size for a big snack as you get 1 waffle with your choice of toppings or choose from pre made combos .
great french inspired cuisine in a beautiful carefree desert setting . you truly do feel a world away here and at binkley 's .
terrific place to grab some food and a pint . the staff here is extremely friendly and courteous .
prices are fair and inexpensive . love the food .
this place is awesome what a wonderful birthday brunch .
amazing food , great service and even better martinis ! if you 're looking for a date night i would highly recommend this cute italian restaurant .
the phad thai was ok , but a little overly sweet , which seems to be the norm around az .
i 'm in love with their mango mojito ... fruity , but not too sweet .
no atmosphere , poor lighting , so many things wrong .
- although they only had three beers on tap , at least they were good craft beer choices .
oh and the prices are very reasonable .
for how quick they turnaround the food , it did n't taste like hotel banquet food where things are dry or mushy .
great wine list as well .
the sandwich i had was the classic reuben with chips . it was packed to the fullest with corned beef and sauerkraut , with the 1000 island dressing gives it the perfect kick to make it the perfect hot sandwich !
its a small place and they only have bar seating but they have thoughtful little touches like new hair bands so your hair does n't fall in your bowl while eating : ) .
i think everyone at our table had either wine or beer ( they have an ok beer selection , but nothing fancy , and only bottles ) .
prices are also incredible i 'd recommend the bulgogi beef plate # 9 and the kimchi soon tofu # 3 i think .
great location ( westgate ) , huge meal portions & the chicken pieces were warm & juicy .
i started off with a lychee sangria that was light and refreshing with hints of lychee and lemon .
it is so rude .
they also seemed to have a decent selection of wine and beer .
always satisfied ! i love coming in for lunch on a working day .
the decor is a bit weird for the ambiance of the restaurant , i guess its a talking piece .
you get a lot of food for a cheap price as well !
i love the friendliness of the staff here .
my $ 11 dollar total meal would 've been $ 16 anywhere else .
the wife and i had craft cocktails ( elderflower & a cranberry martini and blackberry whiskey lemonade ) for $ 6 each and they were delicious .
when we arrived half our party was late but they were kind enough to seat us anyway ( that 's why this is a two star review ) .
shame on you lamanna 's for the worst customer service i have ever received .
first off , this place is so beautiful ( interior and exterior ) overlooking the lake and the ambience is romantic and lush .
the prices are very reasonable too .
it 's pretty pricy , but 100 % worth it .
the burgers were fine . the sweet potato fries were lame , really soggy .
slightly more expensive than the menu price though .
the meat itself is dry and it seems they are not fresh .
i am a seasoned eater of pho , and the chicken pho i had here was actually quite delicious .
fortunately i have sampled many other goodies off the plates of my companions and everything was great . highly recommended .
the cost came to about $ 10 which is a bit expensive .
they have an especially good $ 10 lunch special weekdays that is great value .
i know it was the food , because i have n't eaten much of anything else and we both got sick .
a little too dark , but nothing annoying .
they were cold and tasted like old dirty potatoes with no seasoning and no effort put into them .
i went yesterday for dinner , i literally watched them put my burger in a microwave . my blizzard was good though .
my husband and i shared a delicious shrimp cocktail and ordered the petite filet which was melt-in-your-mouth perfect . brussels sprouts were excellent .
the kid they have working the register is really a poor choice in hiring .
it was gothic , creepy , but strangely noisy .
the spicy salmon was awful . the salmon was pale and smelled off , again not fishy but off .
i also loved how it was elegantly decorated but was still hip and casual . overall , the atmosphere for me was a 5/5 !
the place is always jammed with people .
to top it off no draft beer in the theater only the bar ?
the decor everywhere screams pearls on swine -- an attempt to make something cheap and shoddy look fancy .
both came with fries that were also tasteless and hard .
there were the normal beer options ( no craft ) and the wine was barefoot so nothing to write home about .
my issue is that the customer service , like other reviews stated , is bad .
so the setting is good all around .
the only thing i 'm a bit upset about was the waitress who lied to us .
good food and drink menu with reasonable pricing and specials .
beer selection was large however , so i 'm sure beer drinkers enjoy that . i do not really drink beer though .
management seriously needs to get some people with some personality and regard for customers who are patronizing .
i 'm a water drinker , so i was very happy at the water bottles on the table .
fish is tasty and very fresh .
it came out medium rare which is fine with me but that was the driest piece of meat i 've ever had !
the price is good .
the bacon chili cheese tasted no better than something i could have ordered at wienerschnitzel ... super salty and the chili tasted nasty like it was `` fresh '' out of the can .
mighty expensive but you get what you pay for .
words are n't enough bad service , mediocre food but the price $ $ $ $ is the same no matter what kind of experience you have .
love the view from the balcony .
the owners have a lot of character and spunk . they 're adorable !
perfect choice as it was a great way to sample three pastas .
the salad was fine , the chicken was a bit skimpy and the mashed potatoes came out cold .
the beer kegs are covered in wood barrels which gives it a nice saloon vibe to the place .
our food was delicious and i love how my diet coke arrived in a cute little glass bottle !
almost forgot about my terrible coronarita ... cheap margarita mix in a normal drinking glass with a corona sticking out .
the pizza here is the best and just keeps getting better . great crust .
very weak chinese food . general tso chicken was mediocre , everything else was awful .
when i got home i took one bite and felt rubbery uncooked chicken in the center of one of the chicken cubes .
an order is $ 12 during happy hour , but when the check came , the total jumped to $ 19 . that 's right , $ 7 dollars more for one lamp chop .
i thought the atmosphere was trendy and loungy with a `` super hip '' waitstaff .
they were quite mushy and hardly crispy .
they bring a huge glass for the wine , and a little carafe of wine , barely enough to wet the inside of the glass .
drinks are good too and they have a few cool alcohol free cocktails to choose from which is a plus .
i had a shrimp and cheese appetizer that was delicious . the name of escapes me now , all i remember is that it was tasty lol .
great atmosphere and it 's not super loud so we can talk comfortably .
they are pretty reasonably priced for the quantity of food you get ( which can be a lot ) .
it was n't even that busy , honestly .
it was surprisingly strong too - usually , i find places just pour more juice than alcohol into sangria so i was pleasantly surprised when i sipped my sangria that i was able to taste the alcohol bouncing off some yummy juices .
especially not for the premium price .
i love this place .
drink service was great .
they were only good for light beer even thought they said any domestic beer .
the service was always excellent and the employees always seemed upbeat .
the décor is nothing special but they were playing a fifties movie on the televisions .
small but adorable and dog friendly patio is a great place to relax and people watch .
i have n't been willing to try this place because of it 's funny name .
plus i was the only customer in there and they had the show `` the view '' on , volume on full blast .
and i will say that i did enjoy the mimosas - they had a good balance of sparkling wine and orange juice .
best jerk chicken and curry goat i ever had , period !
the cheesesteak had just the right amount of flavor , the meat actually had taste to it , not too greasy , and everything was chopped up nice and fine how i like it .
i also love their cornbread .
the location was cool and trendy i loved the decor .
the naan was fresh and hot and huge . the nihari beef was soft and the soup the nihari was in was flavourful .
nice - most restaurants charge for this .
i 'm glad we came here to try it , but it was n't so amazing that i 'd come back .
prices are reasonable and the food is really great .
a couple of glasses of wine and some beet salad and we were full .
my only complaint is that the restaurant is so dark it makes reading the menus difficult ( they should offer flashlights or invest in backlit menus ) .
and bad waiters/waitresses wonder why they get bad tips
maybe i just ordered the wrong dish .
the men 's room was disgusting and out of towels .
2. the menu , way too cluttered , font too small , very hard to read compounded by the poor lighting .
went here for lunch and had a great experience !
as we walked out the host told us to have a nice day and had no clue that we were the last people he seated .
i walked in with my friend ( just the two of us ) and we were rudely asked if we had reservations .
the price is a little bit high , but considering the size , it 's fine .
from the gray carpeting to the dull green walls , the cheap fixtures , the lack of art or music to the so-so food and slow service this place can best be described as dull , bland and boring mixed with no ambience at all .
we tried a curry chicken salad pasta and it was delicious . i created a custom turkey sandwich and it was also delicious .
we did n't try any cocktails , but the beer selection was n't too bad .
the atmosphere of this place was awesome , very nice urban design with a warm feeling .
i enjoyed a few glasses of the rose wine and french dip on recommendations from the wonderful waiter .
$ 45 for the signature `` hickory smoked manhattan '' , unusual , a one time experience . sailor 's mojito , thick and sweet .
many of the servings were huge .
when asking the waiter about the kitchen being slow , he confirmed that our order was delivered to the wrong table .
i kindly said no but thank you , and shortly after someone right behind arrived with our food .
the wait was about 20 minutes longer than estimated , however wasnt too bad since we could grab some beers from the bar . the only problem was it took a good 10 minutes to get a beer .
it tastes very good at first but the aftertaste is pretty odd . in conclusion , i had a pretty good experience here .
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
the `` og '' margarita was n't bad in flavor , but did n't have any indication that any tequila was in it .
not anything memorable and the lighting is bright and unremarkable .
this french restaurant was very cute and had an amazing view of the bellagio fountain .
chicken was delicious , tender , moist and crunchy .
it would have been nice if they told us from the beginning .
they only had 5 beers on tap , which i thought was sort of odd .
start with an icy cold ketel martini or a moscow mule served in a copper mug at one of the two bars .
they also have a great happy hour and sunday drink specials .
after trying to pick through them , i just gave up on eating any the pork chili verde which i received had skin of some sort in it , but otherwise seemed to be okay though it tasted unlike anything i had ever had , but later i got horribly ill with extreme , painful intestinal cramping , diarrhea , and chills .
it is extremely unprofessional for a hostess to behave that way and not seat people based on some drama !
it was a nice place to seat and catch up with an old friend , where the music is n't too loud , but soon after our plates and glasses went empty we were served the bill ( without asking ) , as if to hint that we should leave .
greeted by a mirror maze and really sharp color scheme the ambiance has a lot more to be desired . dated !
luckily there 's plenty of outdoor seating in the plaza .
very sadly it did not measure up at all : ( the posole soup did not have hominy and radishes like at the other restaurants , it seriously seemed like they just threw pork in some broth .
atmosphere : chic , classic design and spectacular view of the waterfall .
in fact , the scallops that we were most excited to try seem to have gone from 3 for $ 17 down to 2 for $ 17 .
ordered a tofu bowl ( only comes in one size ) it was mostly rice and just a few pieces of raw cabbage and carrots . i also order pot stickers ... they were okay besides the bottoms being burnt .
we ordered a margarita which was pretty tasty , and definitely had an adequate amount of alcohol .
they also have a huge selection of beer , wine and bites to enjoy with your beverages . great place !
they were okay , not great . the sauce was good but the wings were overcooked so were too dry .
black beans were okay , nothing special about them , but they were still tasty .
every question i asked , she had absolutely no answer for .
great food and a nice crew .
i really liked the potstickers and ample pours of wine ! ; ) my coworker was also really happy with the service .
we started with a bottle of chenin blanc which was pretty tasty for the price .
very nice space , chic . good service and innovative tasty food .
i was thrilled with their happy hour sake bottle specials and the lsd roll is to die for .
the usual employees there are probably the worst at customer service .
bad : the decor .
the prices are good and reasonable .
i ordered an old fashioned ( my favorite cocktail ) , and they did it right : no muddling or splash of seltzer water , just bourbon , bitters , an orange peel and a luxardo cherry ( not one of those highly processed neon cherries ) on ice .
it 's not likely we will return .
it 's also extremely reasonable pricing .
great portion of food . awesome food , cheap price .
only weird thing is the ridiculously short doors in the women 's bathroom so people can see you pee . pro tip : there 's a stand a lone handicap bathroom , use that instead .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
the wine list is exceptional .
we settled on a wonderful bottle of caymus red schooner malbec for $ 40 and it was peppery and delightful .
otherwise the other staffs are smiling , friendly , kind and helpful .
the only complaint i would have is the service , these people could care less that you 're in there and can definitely be rude and extremely to the point .
upon arriving the same questions about a minimum table price were asked and we were informed that we were getting a nice table without the minimum price because we had not been there before .
it was great until the table minimum was raised to $ 25 and we were up a measly $ 100 .
all the yelp reviews are spot on and would highly recommend anyone to try the omelet house
everything is a bit expensive , but i guess you get what you pay for ... although they could be a little lower .
the food is pretty good and it 's a great price at lunch .
it 's super cheap too , ca n't beat it .
servers were nice as well !
pillow talk ( pear vodka , lemon , orange , strawberries , cucumber and club soda ) was my favorite but stranger danger ( peach whiskey and iced tea ) was also very good .
pricing is very reasonable too .
the meats are cured in house and the cheeses were different and tasty .
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
the price , worth it for only deco . food wise , definitely not .
i do n't mean if the decor is tacky or outdated .
the only reason i do n't give them 5 stars is there are no seats to sit and eat , just a short counter .
the restaurant itself is pretty minimal , big paint words like smash and burger all over the walls .
bbq boneless wings : 1 star ... the chicken was ok , unfortunately they were covered in a bottle of bbq sauce that was n't very good .
really cool place ! it 's a speakeasy and it was actually kind of fun trying to find this place .
only thing `` nola '' was tacky beads on the lighting .
the floor is n't the greatest , bathrooms ... let 's ignore those .
chicken was poorly seasoned and dry , the sauce had zero flavor and the bun seemed stale but heated in an attempt to cover it up .
tasted good , but all pricey ... $ 5 for a 16 oz water bottle !
the decoration and interior really suck unfortunately .
also got the bubble pop cocktail ( champagne & blood orange ) which was on point our server was very tentative & nice .
i like that it was n't overly sweet like a bunch of the other creme brûlées i 've tasted .
the food came fast and the drinks were strong .
prices for me , seem a bit high .
the best part is there sauces they 've got a hot , habanero , green and then guac sauce . guac sauce is by far my favorite .
so we paid the checks `` as is '' because we were getting a bit annoyed .
jeff , the owner is very involved in the day to day management and is an amazing chef .
nice blend of spice , avocado , and tomato to go with the chicken .
prices are pretty reasonable for a nice breakfast that is not your run of the mill stuff .
fries are great ... the rest of the menu not so great .
awesome ! the martini glass with the cake and icecream was rimmed with sugar and pop rocks !
it 's also super expensive .
my friend ordered a really large chicken salad with mango and all sorts of other fresh goodies on top .
one thing i did enjoy a lot was baked muscle but that was the only highlight .
the entire staff was extremely friendly and personable .
they had it open air because the weather was so great .
decent prices and good service .
ordered a beer in the bottle as they only had the typical `` crap '' in my opinion on draft .
the champagne and oj ratio was just right for me and i downed about 6 of those !
one kind of beer .
i thought the $ 5 playing fee was more than reasonable .
same goes for the baked potato , used to be amazing this time was very bland , the cheese was not even melted and they were skimpy on the butter and sour cream . over all the service was fast , but then again we went on a rainy thursday night .
feel a bit silly .
the price is reasonable .
had a glass of tempranillo which went perfectly with the meal .
for around $ 50 , our order would of fed 4 or 5 people ( good value ) .
the only negative i can offer ( which was difficult , 'cause almost everything else was perfect ) was the fluorescent lighting - no one wants to be reminded of `` work '' when they 're trying to unwind with a nice meal - and the lighting reminded me of that .
nice chill atmosphere and comfortable space and outdoor donning area . would recommend .
the broth is so flavorful and the noodles are amazing !
always heard about this place and finally gave it a try .
patio is nice and the volume level is n't too loud . service is good and the crowd is decent .
all of which is delicious .
it 's a beautiful hotel .
the food was ok but not impressed at all .
was way heavy on the tequila and not refreshing and light which is what i was hoping with the fruit juice and mint .
i come here pretty often as they have more of a lounge environment past dinnertime and they do have tvs everywhere for sports entertainment .
prices are good too .
good food reasonable price .
cost roughly $ 6 for the meal which was n't bad .
the food is mostly tasteless and sloppy .
we hate to make any trouble but we just could n't stand the taste of it .
a little fun at a ridiculous cost $ 180 for four and i only had nachos !
it can be a bit noisy due to the ceiling reflecting sound around you but not terrible .
fast , friendly service .
presentation is horrible , i 've had sandwiches that were in three sections in the wrapper and wraps where the paper wrapper was halfway inside the tortilla touching the chicken and sauce .
my patron cosmo drink was perfectly made - not too sweet or strong and the service could n't have been better .
me being a huge music lover i could n't help but notice all these record covers on the wall .
reasonably priced and a decent size too .
the lobster and shrimp spring rolls were the best thing i tried here all night . amazing .
and if you are not staying at the hotel the price of admission is only $ 20 , which is not bad compared to so many of the pools on the strip .
nice , dim lighting . decor a little heavy on the taxidermy , but the decorator kept to her concept and constructed a coherent atmosphere .
i did n't find the price very cheap at $ 11.50 but it 's not terrible either .
this place is known for their vegetarian and vegan selections and they are perfectly accommodating for meat eaters as well .
my favorite had to be the pizza special of the day with fried eggplant .
we ordered a house wine and a draft beer , nothing complicated .
the staff are super nice very helpful .
they have blackberry mint iced teas that are awesome , i get one every time i go .
the only not great thing was the margarita which seemed over-priced with a poor pour of tequila .
beer and margaritas available , not sure about any other alcohol .
this place is not cheap , and you should n't expect it to be . once you walk into the wynn or encore , you should expect to pay some $ $ $ for anything you want .
great drinks & dessert ! they have a fabulous , extensive drink menu & their drinks are strong but pricey ( $ 18 each ) .
really good taco 's but a little expensive . $ 5 dollars at taco seems like a decent price but your going to need at least three to be satisfied .
and it helps that their prices are reasonable .
food - on our visit , we had the ox tripe and tongue appetizer along with sliced chicken in garlic sauce ( classic chinese dish but replacing pork with chicken ) and shredded pork in bean sauce .
we got there at 8:00 pm and saw one show , and then at 9:25 the other belly dancer came out ... the girls are amazing and it 's great to see them dance , but i just wish that they would have let us know that when we came in as opposed to telling us they came out every 40 mins .
menu prices were higher for a burger joint but considering the location , not outrageous .
the eggs hire spinach avacado flatbread had two giant tomatoes on it which i do n't like at all- tomatoes was n't on the menu .
angus was probably good quality , but the burgers were poorly packed , and definitely been sitting in fridge or freezer .
it 's very distracting and weird .
so we said fine , we want some kind of proof , offered to pay for the meal and at that point the manager saw that other people were watching and finally gave the full refund .
waiter was rude and we were there over 2 hours even though we made a reservation .
it came with a portobello mushroom intend of a beef patty which was insanely juicy and delicious . the waffle fries were addicting and the dipping sauce sealed the deal for this quick meal .
order a miller lite and was given a draft beer even though i said i hated draft .
the prices are great too .
the wine list is great .
good food and warm ambiance .
i think it needs more lighting of some kind .
best and i were led to this spot by fellow yelpers . we are so glad !
even so , very good quality for a very reasonable price .
it was also good but a drink to sip on because it was on the stronger side .
the bathrooms have some of the weirdest art up on the walls of butts and elephants doing suggestive things and fat people and naked greek statues and every weird , crude , amusing thing you can think of .
i have been here before and with bigger groups with great service .
the steak i order was not rare , like i ordered it . it was a very bland flavor .
the lighting is odd ... it is dim , but not the right kind of dim . it 's not warm lighting it is like fluorescent bulbs dimmed .
it 's pretty cheap for all the food you get .
the prices would have been fairly high if not for that .
the burger was okay ( nothing to write home about ) , but the fries were greasy and cold .
great even for lunch ! brought my grandmother here for a beautiful birthday lunch .
the rolls are very tiny and the price is actually really cheap .
both were very good and very refreshing , the lime reminded me of a lemonade slush .
our group had the chicken dumpling soup , talapia , smothered pork chops , mac and cheese , and cornbread .
good location , clean , comfortable .
clean place . nice decor .
chicken pita was dry and tasteless . it had a funny taste , it had to be day old .
i also got a cadillac margarita that tasted like they just lazily put the alcohol and margarita mix .
food was bland and some under cooled and some over cooked .
for the price ( cheap ! )
fairly typical sports bar . food was decent quality though more expensive than it should be .
another bummer was that they only service wine and beer , but lacked a strong list of either .
great place for some drinks and appetizers too !
the pool is great fun . marquee is always amazing and the food and gaming is the best on the strip .
it were okay , nothing special .
and it is n't crazy priced .
it is very loud though .
even with the queso , which i eventually dumped the whole thing into , my meal was pretty bland .
the lunch buffet is about $ 13 per person and you have a decent selection .
great service . family atmosphere .
they have a cucumber happy hour drink that is killer .
everything tasted great ! we had calamari , bruschetta , shrimp and they were all delicious !
the staff is nice , they do n't give attitude and have yet to mess up my order .
after about another 15 minutes we finally found our waitress and asked about my missing flatbread and she advised they made the flatbread wrong and were remaking it .
i will agree that the menu is pricey , but not outrageous .
very reasonably priced , especially considering the amount of food you get .
the tacos were wet and soggy ; the rice and beans were also cold , and half the amount of which is normally on the plate .
their waitstaff is fantastic and friendly .
the beer was fine , and if i had known the dos equis was only 3 dollars a bottle i would have stuck with that rather than the negra modelo .
too hard to get what i want and there 's zero quality control i guess .
it is located at the lower level , to the right of the stairs of the euclid entrance in the arcade .
i gave them three stars because the food was hot when it got to our table but the service was poor .
firstly : the restaurant name does n't give enough credit to the classy interior .
large , juicy sandwiches with great flavour .
the bathroom is in serious need of an update and lighting .
came here for the reviews and stayed for the amazing food !
they were definitely not a healthy color . chicken was really dry and the lemon on my plate actually looked like it was pulled out of a garbage can .
food/menu : we only ordered drinks on tap while the ladies had smoothies .
love this place . i 've been here a few times and i always leave super full and satisfied .
do n't like the $ 25 resort fee . that 's ridiculous since their rates are already pricey .
i think the price is a tad bit expensive .
we had great seats to listen to the gondola singers -- their voices are amazing .
the carnitas were good , but the meat itself was a bit bland .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
beer selection was large however , so i 'm sure beer drinkers enjoy that . i do not really drink beer though .
the ambience is nice , i sat in the bar area .
the only not great thing was the margarita which seemed over-priced with a poor pour of tequila .
food is cold , bun stale , and fries chewy .
the beer selection was decent for canned beers but the only had one brand on tap and the one i wanted was out .
the entire rest of the time he would walk by our table and not say anything at all .
under dimmed lights the tiny font menu is almost impossible to read .
the visuals are stunning to start off with .
the drinks were good ( mojitos ! margaritas ! )
the dining area is always clean as well . it is a cozy restaurant and the seating is limited .
decent wine list as well .
it 's also a great value .
it was all cooked perfectly and tasted great . service was great also .
thank you for all being awesome !
nice , dim lighting . decor a little heavy on the taxidermy , but the decorator kept to her concept and constructed a coherent atmosphere .
the prices are a bit on the expensive side . maybe i 'm more used to the pricing in markham , where the quality might be a bit lower , but this one seemed quite expensive .
normally that is n't an issue though .
prices are decent , and you get lots for cheap !
they 've also added an even thinner , thin crust pizza called the delight .
this was a great bbq soul food place and george the owner was a great guy and i love the story behind the restaurant .
for the price this is a pretty nice little stop . very reasonable prices and good quality food .
can easily drink all night for under $ 20 .
prices are very reasonable .
we asked for a booth , she said there were none and we counted 9 empty . we were finally seated in the bar .
really light on the chicken considering you pay $ 2 for it .
it 's a really trendy place with some good looking food and a good vibe .
awesome selection of beer ( 1000 ) and whisky ( 600 ) !
when the server finally came over we were ready to order , she then told us that it was last call on food , we were confused by this because it was only 9:30 and it was n't our fault we sat late .
bathroom was disgusting . looked like someone puked in the sink , urinal and on the floor .
it 's definitely a hole in the wall place , but the quality for the price is extremely high . carnitas are especially good .
the fries were really good , greasy enough but not nasty . the burgers were yummy , too .
for someone who is vegetarian , the oil tasted of meat which could mean they have dirty oil .
my family loves persian food , so we decided to try out this place based on great reviews here .
for the prices you would think the quality of food would be at least decent .
$ 1 , $ 2 , and $ 3 street tacos , a pretty good steal when they 're normally $ 14 for three tacos ( ridiculous and would never pay that much ) .
and the frozen margarita did n't seem to have hardly any tequila .
great customer service . we found a rubber band in our food and the employee treated us right and got us a refund and new burrito .
the low-quality led pot lights give this place a depressing , cold atmosphere . it may seem unimportant , but it 's not : the lighting changes the look of the food , and that affects how we experience it .
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
the service was weird and the decor confusing .
the chicken shawarma is crunchy and tender at the same time , and the cream sauce is incredible .
good food but do n't hire them to cater an event .
random but the bathroom was clean .
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
i know most beer drinkers prefer piss like corona and budweiser and heineken , but us beer snobs are kind of left in the cold it seemed .
pretty expensive but worth it .
although we did n't try a margarita , they do have a pretty good beer selection .
come for the beer and the outdoor seating and activities when the weather 's nice ... eat somewhere else .
- coconut macaroons : best i 've ever tried ; they were gooey and delicious and completely addictive .
it also had lots of crab in it , which was delicious .
our waiter was not very good and even after we still tipped him he brought back out bill and asked for more gratuity . that 's was pretty tacky for such a nice place .
right from the very beginning , there were many loud cackling sounds coming from the bar .
this place was great !
the vibe inside is really cool , trendy yet chill .
the line is usually eating into the dining space anyways on summer evenings price - one scoop is more than $ 4 , this is quite outrageous compared to the price of a premium pint of ice cream , competition , or the cost of making great ice-cream yourself . the food gets a 4 , the value gets a 2 making this a 3 .
great cocktails , but no draft beer . need i say more ?
some people have complained about the decor and how the orange walls and 2 paintings on the walls are boring .
luckily our other entrees did n't show up for a while so after some conversation -- my partner and i are loath to make waves when eating out unless necessary -- we explained our discontent to the server and asked her to make sure the remaining 3 entrees came out hot .
i also was surprised at how strong their signature cocktails were - $ 9 for a cocktail but they pack a punch .
the staff was immediately friendly , attentive without being invasive and genuinely appeared to be enjoying their jobs and eachother .
the arugula salad was amazing and had just the right balance of goat cheese , onions , and honey .
the spicy salmon roll was solid , the saving grace of the meal . the salmon itself was very fresh and flavorful and there was a delightful spicy , creamy sauce adorning each roll .
went to eat here and after waiting over 10 minutes of watching all the waitresses walk by finally got up to find a manager .
the service was a little slow considering there are only 6 tables there .
i have never experienced a more ridiculous restaurant situation in my life .
and flavor was decent , nothing special .
this time i spoke to ruby who was also rude and defensive .
the restaurant itself is sort of corny with crude and silly signs posted .
they do put a tea tab on your table , but i 'm a little shocked to read the reviews below .
server was good but my water was not filled when it sat empty . i 'm sure he would 've had i asked .
way too expensive for pizza .
it is perfect for a date night or a girls night out !
food was delicious ! casey k. was our server and she was so attentive and helpful .
i enjoyed the atmosphere- relaxed with good music playing .
unfortunately i did not like it and ordered a bottled domestic .
ca n't explain why but it seems very harsh and not homey despite the booths lining the walls of the place .
after reading reviews here on yelp and hearing from a few friends that lolos is awesome , i was so excited to eat there .
as for the drinks : -after all , the bar was just calling out to me and although i had hoped to see more beers on tap , unfortunately , a majority of their beer list was bottled .
they have a really cheap daily special , but normal lunch specials are fair enough on price .
they were out of ginger beer so she use fresh ginger and gingerale to make my moscow mule , which was surprisingly good .
prices are moderate , but quality is staggeringly good .
you can get the combo plate with all different types of ribs , but the beef rib will be something you ca n't forget .
some people have complained about the decor and how the orange walls and 2 paintings on the walls are boring .
it was all good , but seemed a bit overpriced at $ 39 .
staff is very nice and friendly .
the prices are reasonable .
they also seemed to have a decent selection of wine and beer .
we will definitely visit again ! thank you super taco !
first of all , they only have beer and wine , no liquor .
always a good time coming here !
the portions were decent for the price , but keep in mind that you 're definitely paying the vegas upcharge .
the food is great , taste is nice and the portions are healthy and tummy filling .
good menu selection ; very good service . reasonably priced .
the beef buns were tasted good but nothing special .
vegas is filled with amazing dining experiences , pick another restaurant .
we stumbled upon this spot on our way out of phoenix to sedona and honestly we were just craving tacos ... so glad we overlooked location as it is in the parking lot of a motel 6. so worth it .
since i was visiting az i wanted to try many different beers .
its a little more expensive than most places , but you definitely get what you pay for .
it was way too watered down and although it was n't bland , it could have tasted a lot better if it was thicker !
( magic ) i enjoyed a roasted veggie starter and veal milanese with a salad which was all so perfectly prepared and so delicious .
drink price and food is very reasonable .
we all know what fried ice cream is and when you 're served a ball of ice cream rolled in soggy corn flakes ... wth ... not impressed .
quality food , decently priced .
the prices are fairly reasonable .
eh ... the person who took our to go order was nice , and it 's decent priced ... for that a 3 but my sauce on my raviolis was just bland maybe out a can with no seasoning , i paid extra for meatballs and got two small ones . i 'm guessing my pasta was put in bowl then sauce over cuz they were all stuck together .
with great areas to work in or lounge at plush a small meeting room this coffee shop is a great place for a sunday drive .
my only issue was with the kiosk on the table where we paid .
we skipped the alcohol , but the cocktail list is wonderful , and the beer and wine choices very good .
food was just okay honestly a bit overcooked , service was n't great either and we had some food residue floating in our cups .
i 'm never in this area anymore , but i 'm glad coffee plantation is still here .
this is good on the go or to ear there and they have a patio .
not a bad bar .
the chili was ok -- i think i 've had better . finally , the fried steak was the star .
their prices are very reasonable as well .
we brought our own game and played but were charged the $ 5 per person anyways .
the architecture tripped me up a bit because i was afraid the ceiling was going to collapse .
you can easily get two meals out of one salad for $ 7 .
other than that the view is spectacular .
their moscow mule was packed with smooth vodka that went down easy and refreshed me for a night of partying .
sad experience this weekend when attempting to go to dinner .
the entire plate was mush .
ca n't explain why but it seems very harsh and not homey despite the booths lining the walls of the place .
as we sat down a server came by and asked us if we wanted anything to drink ... wtf ? we had that option when we ordered our food .
their mapo tofu is our family favorite . owners are very nice and they have good portion size with all the fresh ingredient and with good price .
hey that 's great thank you .
hobak is amazing their cuts of meat are so tender and juicy and at a great price .
i ended up pulling the fish out of the batter and just eating it with a few of the sad soggy fries .
the decor was atrocious ( i would rather not have to look at a statue of a naked man while i am eating ) and the walls were covered in pictures of half-naked people and pin-up girls .
prices are reasonable ( ~ $ 8 ) and service is fast !
once we discovered the wine we liked best , we ordered a bottle .
the patio area is so nice and worth a hang out .
price was reasonable for four people at $ 120 .
great little ( really little ) beer & wine bar .
the atmosphere is just plain stupid and tacky .
i love this place !
happy hour ( which is all day ! )
the chairs are kind of weird ... all metal , but that 's to go with the theme i suppose .
not only did i get a response in less than 24 hours , i was asked what i wanted for the event , not given a structured package that i had to adhere to .
the ambiance is cozy and you can order taster glasses of the wines !
the prices were totally reasonable too .
5 star food at one $ prices . easily the best quality for your dollar in the city !
it 's like a book ! the food is decent though , and the vibe is super chill .
the fajita looks like crap , and taste chewy and not like chicken and fatty . the tortilla is dry and stale .
the atmosphere is just plain stupid and tacky .
there was no doubt that there was pork mixed with the chicken .
if you like doing makeup , the lighting in the bathroom and entire room sucked .
very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get .
we sat at the bar and ordered drinks ( draft beer for the husband , a limoncello cocktail for me ) and pizzas ( chicken pesto for him and vegan for me ) .
for the price i paid ( $ 15 ) , i was thoroughly disappointed .
not sure if that was part of the special , but thought it was kind of strange .
it is affordable and pretty big . the downfall ?
the prices for a chain restaurant with mediocre food at best are exorbitant and totally unjustified .
cocktails : the ketel sodas were amazing !
perhaps i misread his tone , but i certainly did n't feel welcome at this establishment .
bartender was very attentive and friendly .
never had a bad experience here .
at that point , we 'd had enough . we asked for the check for the drinks and salads , though the lady was kind enough to take those off for us , because she knew we were not satisfied with the experience .
great atmosphere . only downside - very , very noisy .
the unlimited beer/wine was nice , but there was only one craft beer on tap , which was disappointing .
i would however , highly recommend the strawberry lemonade .
it did n't feel `` clean '' as another reviewer said and the bright lights just showcase every imperfection of the place .
it was just `` ok '' nothing spectacular . fish still was kinda frozen .
do n't even think about a steak at this place , can you say terrible ?
there is probably no way i would ever return because the restaurant clearly had a fly problem !
keep up the great work !
i ordered a jelly coconut & rum and mista chin 's fancy gin but ended up feeling disappointed with the drinks , particularly the coconut drink .
i live in the san francisco bay area and these were so good i had to take a dozen on the plane home ! they 're a must every time in phx
the food is fresh . the prices are unbelievably cheap .
the place is modern and quaint , easy accessible bathrooms .
prices are i but higher than normal bars but food is much better .
the food is decent but overpriced .
this place has unique items on the menu .
with the high ceilings the sound travels and the place is very loud when busy .
meh . the price is pretty cheap , and the service is whatever .
we were the only other people in the restaurant and the service was slow and horrible .
i do not order tap beer there , the selection is very weak anyway .
they were super accommodating to my picky toddler .
the result is an uncomfortable hour-long struggle to not slip off the `` stool '' onto the floor !
it 's amazing ! reservations recommended !
also , the women 's restroom was dirty and there were paper towels all over the floor .
the prices are very reasonable .
not sure what happened there , but what a shame .
however they have one of the best food specials - a nice variety of things for $ 2.95 .
atmosphere is fun , a little loud but still very good place to host a get together .
the one thing i thought a little unusual was that they served beer , had a couple of taps and some bottled craft beers listed on a chalkboard .
no draft beer there but a nice cold bottle of corona .
there was n't much of a tap selection . also i do n't know if we picked 6 bad beers or if the taps were bad but none of the beers were good .
this is why i love yelp !
plus , $ 18 for a three-course lunch is great value for the quality of food that we received .
oh well , good food and great prices . good value .
$ 55 for two with tip , so very expensive for what you get .
when you add in all of the tattoos , nose rings , ear discs and other face jewelry it just gives a trashy look to an otherwise beautiful restaurant .
however the bill was $ 40 for an early dinner for two , which is crazy considering the quality of the food !
we got in for cheaper as we were staying at the bellagio , and as chicks we got 2 free drinks with a choice of vodka or champagne ... which was warm !
good choice of spirits on hh as well .
having worked in the area for many years , i was thrilled when this place opened in 2013. the staff is passionate about quality , variety and service .
everything here is cheap . cheap food , cheap drinks and cheap tables .
this is my favorite place to eat when i am in phoenix .
the hot are very hot as well not as hot as the suicide but close .
it 's a great value for the price you pay .
the place is priced right ... the waitstaff is pretty clueless ... but because it 's so inexpensive it is a fair deal .
the only accurate thing on the receipt was at the bottom where it reads `` here pos ''
fast service cheap prices and great quality of food .
terrible atmosphere , super bright and loud . staff is so unfriendly .
i 'm not sure why they even call it bulgogi because it was cooked in curry sauce and i could n't taste any traditional bulgogi marinade at all .
the garlic mash taters a bit lumpy for the way i like them , but they were decent .
2. the menu , way too cluttered , font too small , very hard to read compounded by the poor lighting .
trying to place a to go order is difficult , as they rarely pick up the phone on the first try . i also placed an order today and they forgot to put it in , so when i arrived even later than the estimated pick up time , i had to wait an additional 15 minutes .
the waiters were quite rude and made us feel both rushed and unwelcome ( telling us to hurry up and order , clearing plates before we were done ) .
i got the bernaise sauce on the side and it was great . the mac & cheese was fantastic .
i love pizza and decided to give this place a try .
that 's cool - unless you write `` freaky fast '' all over your walls ; - )
we were so happy with the food and drank ... .yes drank !
it was n't even bottled , pretty sure it was tap .
i would 've given 4 stars except i think they raised the price of the combo . i 'm pretty sure it used to be $ 36 but now it 's $ 40 , that extra $ 4 cost them a star in my book .
we are so glad you are now in gilbert !
they have comfortable booths and great service . i recommend this place .
stephanie checked us in and was very friendly and helpful .
the only negative is that i wish they had a larger selection of beer on tap . they had 7 beers on tap but they did have a huge selection of bottle beers .
i highly highly recommend this place !
if they get the right management .
the st ambroise stout tap kept me happy while most of my friends indulged in cocktails that they all enjoyed .
do n't expect to be full after eating .
and expensive considering the quality of the food .
i had the breakfast sandwich on their house made bread and it was fantastic .
the girl stared at us the entire time we ate , letting us know that we were a huge inconvenience to her .
i 'm annoyed that our waitress was so uninterested because otherwise i 'd give a higher rating .
i thought i was getting a free `` business '' dinner , but the host was so blown away with the prices , i agreed to pitch in to ease the pain of the bill .
went here for restaurant week and everyone in my group loved it .
the beer selection was n't bad .
also poor customer service .
she was very rude and had been rude when we walked in .
even the margaritas were bad ( pre-mixed ) .
therapy 's drinks were amazing mostly bourbon bases with their own smoked version - they brought us a sample it was real smooth with a simple bite at the end and the bottle is gorgeous !
the one weird thing about this place is the lighting .
waitress was apathetic at best , and indignant , rude , and completely inattentive at worst .
the drink was definitely one of my favorite drinks ... refreshing , cold , and delicious !
i just was n't super impressed by anything and they had some sort of weird lighting problems outside on the patio that was kinda uncomfortable when the lights kept going off and changing brightness .
the waiter was extremely nice despite how busy the restaurant is and repeated fill up our water .
the muffins are delicious , the service is great , this is my first time , and i will definitely be back . candace our waitress was very nice , friendly and professional .
it was way to peppery yet bland .
dude , it 's not clean .
always looking for a good non-chain restaurant to grab a bite .
they have an incredible happy hour with pitchers of sangria for cheap and delicious tapas .
horrific veal parma is like frozen shoe leather cooked in used motor oil . hard to recommend but you might have some luck .
i would recommend this place if you want to have a great meal !
not really sure if it 's that special to be $ 18 for a small .
beer selection good but server had no clue .
i ended up paying around $ 60 for dinner for one , when $ 30 would get you a very nice indian meal in pretty much any other place in town .
good selection of beer and helpful bartender . unfortunately , they 'd just tapped out 2 of the 3 beers we chose .
and they have some good beers for the pitcher not .
wine and cocktails were wonderful as well .
the first impression walking into the restaurant with all the graffiti and writing on the walls , not impressed .
they also only have beer , no wine at all .
i also thought it was very reasonably priced .
love the california roll in a bowl .
we had beer served in an ice cold glass , very refreshing .
we ordered the empanadas as an appetizer , chicken hemingway ( chicken wrapped in bacon ) , shrimp in garlic sauce and chicken alfredo as the entrees . the empanadas and shrimp in garlic sauce were tasty .
super tacky in my opinion .
the decor is very new .
not a bad bar .
after enjoying fresh hot bread and pesto , we started with the ahi sashimi ... one of the best and better than roy 's .
this is a nice cool treat when it 's 107 degrees outside .
the bed was hard as a rock and the bathroom had ugly overhead fluorescent lighting and could have easily been a bathroom at a mediocre motel .
good beer selection with the opportunity to order pitchers rather than just pints .
wines by the glass selection was a little weak - 1 rose for a french restaurant ?
so far , every night i 've been in this place is packed .
all in all it was very satisfying .
i like it , it 's well priced and pretty tasty .
our server was very friendly and attentive .
now , factoring in the + $ 15 i paid for the meal , i 'm disappointed . guacamole is an additional + $ 2 .
and they always give us a small shot of almond liquer after dinner - nice touch ...
the lighting was a little weird too .
the atmosphere is relaxed yet romantic , and the price is definitely right .
the drinks : fabulous martini 's ! the service : very attentive .
the lobby looks good but get any further and you start to see the nasty ceiling tiles , cracked and stained drywall , broken faucets , moldy grout and broken furniture .
the bouncers are incredibly rude . the smallest water bottle you 've ever seen is $ 11 .
we liked the ambience and location is perfect .
the sangria is great .
my personal favorites are the szechuan chicken , the curry chicken and the yui shan eggplant .
walleye looked amazing on the plate but lacked flavor and was also overcooked .
let me list the ways : - tv low resolution and comes on at absurdly loud volume - confusing tv user interface - only one luggage stand - confusing directional sign when you get off elevator and are trying to find which long corridor to go down .
the gin rickey was light and refreshing but they forgot to add a lime wedge .
good , not great . it has a pretty standard coffee shop atmosphere , with some fun designs in the interior .
anyhow 75 for 4 people . too expensive .
many of their popular items on their menu were unavailable , food qualify was below average , and service was just okay .
the kids meal is great value $ 10.99 for a ton of stuff .
one of us ordered the fish tacos and the execution of that dish was poor .
drinks - the cocktails were awesome .
this place is great !
pass on the chicken , at least .
loved the chicken shawarma plate and sandwiches .
the pasta has great taste and is prepared fantastically .
he said raspberry ice pic , and this is a girly drink and i loved it .
the decor was tacky to begin with and now its just looking tired and dusty .
as far as seating , it 's a bit crowded , but tables open up frequently .
the restaurant bathroom is just plain dirty .
the food is decent , about what you 'd expect for the cost .
i understand that most high-end burger joints now do not include sides , but $ 20 for a burger and side seems a bit too expensive .
quick pours of wonderful wine , and perfectly portioned tapas . hat tip to jimmie for fantastic service
for drinks make sure you go for happy hour .
the price is very reasonable especially considering their portions .
they even had sparkling water on tap how cool is that !
great beers , bartenders do n't know anything about the beers . the menu is ok. not bad to pair beer with .
the ambiance is cool , and there 's always a lot of people .
there was a green stain on one of the bathroom towels and everything was just dingy , stained and disgusting .
it 's located in an industrial area so might be hard to find .
parking : free , limited parking , quiet area entrance : a bit confusing because they have 2 ( two ) entrance doors but only 1 ( one ) works inside : surprisingly , inside is very modern , clean , organized with warm wood touch color and bamboo .
one guy at our table went to the count of 60 , good thing he was n't driving .
pleasant which looks like it has n't been upgraded since the 70s .
it 's in a strip mall , which is odd since it 's such a nice restaurant .
service is generally pretty good - we love getting fanny as our waitress as she 's super attentive and friendly .
the ambiance of this place is very nice .
a nice enough place , but if they ca n't handle `` hold the eggs '' we ca n't risk ordering from here again and having our dinner plans ( or worse ! ) ruined .
before i go into the pizza , i get it , but it was rather frustrating having to pay $ 2- $ 4 per topping .
the menu and ingredients are very simple , but everything is so good .
we had excellent service , happy hour drinks and a delicious meal .
we were seated very quickly . staff was friendly and knowledgable of the menu .
the sushi is pretty good and the prices are reasonable . the atmosphere is very nice and its a great place for a meal out thats not too fancy or expensive but not cheap and fast food like
beer was ok , but not quite cold enough . nice bartender but a second bartender was needed .
no tap beer , no blended drinks for a decent margaritas and out of steak for tacos .
it was pretty good , but the flavor of the curry was okay .
it 's insane how much these things taste exactly like the real ( yet dead and disgusting ) things .
we had the tempura green beans to start , outstanding . my wife had the farmers salad and i had the frittata , both were delicious .
the menu is very brief but very difficult to read with the lack of lights .
i love the tempura mushroom . naked fish 's sushi 's food is great , service is good and price is reasonable .
my favorite lakewood bar . great food , amazing bartenders , and of course , best happy hour for beer .
it 's a charming place !
the decor was tacky to begin with and now its just looking tired and dusty .
beer was awful and is n't even in a pint glass .
should be an easy order .
perfect for a light meal and margaritas after work .
also , when i was paying with the debit machine , it was set up so you have to give a tip even do you pick up only .
i love the thai bbq chicken and the green chicken curry .
yes it is `` dated '' and lovingly cared for , no it is not the hip painted concrete floors , pin lights , and open ceiling ... get over it , it is part of the experience .
because i prefer all white meat , i was disappointed the only item was the general tsao menu item .
mushroom soup used to be pretty good . did n't like it .
the drink specials were awesome - half price signature drinks and sangria : yum ! ( the happy hour specials run from 4 - 6:30 pm . )
price is a bit high to be honest , but again you 're paying for better meat quality .
very happy with this place , great location and outdoor area .
the bathroom was nice , but the advertisements in the mirror were tacky .
as for the drinks : -after all , the bar was just calling out to me and although i had hoped to see more beers on tap , unfortunately , a majority of their beer list was bottled .
location is slightly awkward inside with bad lighting but not too bad .
for the price , the food 's quality is mighty decent .
so disappointing . i was expecting so much but my salmon was so bland and dry that i did n't finish it .
i 'm sorry but you should never treat a costumer the way our server did .
the lunch specials are quite cheap but the entrees and specials can add up quick .
no more mood lighting , no more fancy chairs and tables and the food was awful .
it was replaced with another draft beer that was n't that great either .
food and drinks are relatively cheap .
perfection . perfect with a glass of champagne .
the beer selection was n't bad .
bad idea ! margaritas were ok but not booze in them !
price is super affordable .
they do have a good wine selection , and the prices are reasonable .
they do have a full bar but no beer on tap .
their house wine is $ 7 which is decent .
also our server hardly ever came around to check on the drink or to remove the old plates and cups attached you will be able to see the accumulation of dirty items not picked up as he went off to other tables to server .
the meal was great and so was the wine pairing .
service was absolutely perfect , we shared 9 different dishes , our cocktails to start were lovely while we perused the wine list - we had 2 excellent bottles and everything was what we had hoped for , and more .
the beer selection was n't bad .
we got the dumplings for an appetizer and they were crispy and delicious !
great cocktails and wine list . very fresh seafood as well .
good beer , the music makes you want to move , and everyone is so friendly .
all was good once we had our drinks , i had the sweeter mojito with guava and my sister loved the huckleberry margarita .
a great as spot to relax and unwind , a real hole in the wall .
our hot sake and beer , appetizer , and one of our entrees came out .
i paid $ 25 dollars for chirashi thinking it would be overflowing with different and high-quality fish .
i would love to stop by here again .
the decor is still there- though seems dirty to me , but my boyfriend insists that it is intentional distressing on the artwork . whatever .
good was good and pretty reasonably priced .
well , this is exactly what we got , a great brunch place , beautiful environment to look around in and have a serene meal .
their drinks were yummy ( especially the mojito ) , the food delicious ( the cheese board was awesome ! ) and the service prompt and friendly .
beer and wine was unlimited , but they were serving only one type of beer .
it felt almost chaotic . the music was loud - the kind with drums beating that gives you a little anxiety , and there were at least 3 or 4 loud bangs from plates dropped or furniture tipping over .
one of the nicest things though is they offer byow ( bring your own wine ) for just $ 10 corkage ( only $ 1 on tuesday i believe ) .
while wines are $ 7-10 and though they only offer 2 beers , they 're extremely cheap at $ 3 .
the vanilla here is good . friendly service and the place was clean .
all the curtains were down too which made it unnecessarily dark . mediocre .
bad service and bad food .
which i did n't get any of ; ) the egg drop soup included w lunch is huge but was n't anything special flavor wise .
granted these prices were n't exactly lee 's prices , but they were pretty darn god for a restaurant .
food was just okay for the high price .
prices are very fair .
the five spice sauce on the ribs was also perfect .
the salmon is very fresh and the rice is warm and melts in your mouth .
and some of the potatoes dishes the potatoes were undercooked ( hard ) .
i loved that they are very generous of fresh fruits on the crepes and blintzes , it was delicious .
i do n't know why , but the entrance feels weird , like its cluttered or just too confined .
i absolutely love tea and i drink it all the time .
i ordered a cappuccino and mimosa , mmmmmm ! the cappuccino was well done and the mimosa was mostly champagne with a splash of orange juice - awesome !
wonderful place - always busy and for good reason .
the fries were kind of limp and not at all crispy , so i ca n't recommend them .
if all you need is a bed & a shower , then find a groupon for $ 25 & win resort fee for $ 70 not bad .
there were also a number of frustrated delivery drivers because they were given wrong orders .
we live in wyoming but get to phoenix on a regular basis and the loving hut has become our favorite vegan restaurant , after trying about every vegan restaurant there .
i like different and tasty food , and they 've got it nailed .
no margaritas . just beer and wine : -/ what 's a girl to do .
very accommodating for substitutions to the menu . waitress was very attentive and friendly .
the beers we ok nothing special .
the interior is absolutely beautiful and the staff is very nice . the food is great .
my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed tonight and would highly recommend you come if you stay in vegas !
always super good , reasonably priced , and satisfying .
fantastic service ! they were super busy for father 's day .
it was n't as creepy as some people made it sound .
food is okay . prices reasonable .
also the fried chicken with peanut sauce .
ca n't say much for the decor- tables and chairs are rickety and the decor bland .
prices were lower than the spectacular quality .
the room was clean and what can you expect for 35 bucks per night .
great sushi ... and very fresh .
finally we got up to leave and asked to pay for our drinks . then he was troubled enough to check on our order .
they were so rude and i was so appalled at this kind of service .
they also have good specialty alcoholic drink with a souvenir cup .
only thing that kept it from 5 stars was slow service .
we 're talking about a popular diner that 's constantly busy yet the staff go out of their way to make sure orders are correct , checking back in reasonable time and doing it with genuine smiles on their faces .
not to mention a nice tropical atmosphere with misters and palm trees .
i am all for reusing perfectly usable furniture but just rolling some interior house paint over it does n't really appeal to me .
the food was also delicious and they have a great selection of drinks and wines .
unfortunately my family and i came here during a busy saturday morning around 9 am .
yuck . the bread was dry and stale .
however i 'm taking off 1 star as they are very slow .
the atmosphere is awesome and the decorated theme with the bus i see is so cool .
the food was tasty with the gyro meat being the true standout .
great coffee , decent food , free wi-fi with plenty of seating on two floors in an eclectic and unique setting just off the capitol square .
we also enjoyed the strawberry mojito and an refreshing frozen beverage .
it 's a room in desperate need of an overhaul ; from the old peeling wallpaper , to plastic tablecloths all the way to a bookshelf filled with old economics textbooks .
prices are affordable and it 's really good .
not cheap , expect to spend at least $ 30.00 for two cocktails .
the person in charge came from behind the bar and gave us some uncalled for attitude .
we had a domestic beer and sweet tea and ordered the taco and ceviche it was awesome !
the place is brightly lit and honestly would n't need lights on during the day because of the stream of shaded sunshine from the window .
my only issue was my fried chicken was a little dry . i could still eat it , but it definitely required sauce .
if you happen to be seated facing that wall or your table is directly underneath that foul lighting ... .well it 's tremendously unpleasant .
we were told they were `` amazing . '' well , no they were n't .
i think for the price you get great value for a 4 star hotel .
it is hot dog nirvana .
super disappointed i spent $ 50 on this breakfast .
the gin cocktail was much spicer , but still well balanced and delicious .
very nice atmosphere , especially now that it 's cool enough for them to leave the tall windows open . the whole restaurant area feels open to the world .
i got the au jus or whatever it 's called on the side but it was also bland , just tasted like oil and made my bread soggy .
service was slow , but i guess that made me expect my meal even more eager . my personal favorites are their chicken kabobs , the lamb is really good as well .
the food looks reasonably priced .
so expensive for such a horrible experience . never going back here .
they did n't have any beer on tap , only select few bottles which was disappointing .
the food is not extravagant but tasty and the breakfast is only 2.00 $ . how you can beat that ?
somewhat full bar not just beer and wine they do have liquor as well .
i love sitting on the porch eating or sitting in the armchairs in the pool room .
came here with a friend for the first time on taco tuesday and was very pleasantly surprised !
the only thing i would complain about is i did n't like their choice of tofu , wish they went with a softer tofu .
and it 's not just a gimmick , despite its cute name and design .
do n't bother with dollar margarita tuesdays . they 're so syrupy it 's impossible to drink an entire glass .
they had a good selection of beers and something i 'd never seen before , jameson on tap . i 'm very curious as to how liquor on tap works ( and why a mexican restaurant had whiskey on tap instead of tequila ) but we did n't have the time to stay and investigate .
i also had one of the local brews on tap which was lightly peach tasting and refreshing .
the space is an awkward set up and on a cold evening , the wind came through and it was bone chilling .
vibe in there is quiet , cool , light jazz music playing .
the only awkward part was the ambiance .
the walls have splatter of food , there is trash on the ground , stains on the ground , and it just looks dirty .
you wo n't be disappointed !
the beers were ok , nothing special .
very nice selection of wine and beer !
i think there were only 3 or 4 beers offered , draft and bottled .
fine selection of alcohol . the only reason not for 5* is that it 's expensive but that 's justified by the area .
great stop for lunch !
i drank the tasteless overpriced drink and switched to beer .
unfortunately the decor is tacky and the whole place ( including the bathroom ) is cluttered by it .
i ordered the lamb to the chef 's liking and everything was incredible .
i felt it was somewhat bland to have a fried green tomato on it .
i 've been once so far .
taro sago was a little bland . the fruity supreme was overpriced for what it was and was also bland .
the beer is cheap but the beer is also awful ; my boyfriend drinks a lot of beer and we went on national beer day .
atmosphere : the patio is nice to sit on when it 's not a trillion degrees outside and the bar has a sparkly countertop which is a nice touch service : service is always decent nothing outstanding or super poor .
disrespectful , out of line , judgmental and rude do n't even begin to touch on the service we got here .
the brownie tasted like something you 'd buy frozen and microwave : / i would n't say that i will never go here again , but do n't see myself going out of my way .
it 's very reasonably priced , and super cheap considering how good the food is , but the lineup is proof enough !
given the service and the atmosphere i highly recommend it .
their drinks are just as good . and , it 's pretty inexpensive .
smallish , but inexpensive and excellent quality !
when i first arrived to cleveland this was the first place i went to for a drink and i have to say this is an excellent place to enjoy great wine good drinks with an excellent setting .
my family and i made reservations for 5pm , right as the restaurant opened for dinner .
the prices are very reasonable .
my boyfriend said it was n't edible . my stepdad said it was `` pretty great for cardboard . ''
good good food . nice atmosphere and friendly servers .
the house cocktails are good and strong .
i do n't get sticker shock often , but that one surprised me and honestly , it was n't worth $ 70 .
best of all the meal is very reasonably priced for lunch .
by the time dessert came out , and after a couple bottles of wine , we were pretty exhausted .
always has an attitude , does n't speak , not good service what so ever !
served with delicious garlic bread and a balsamic green salad .
the decor was very simple yet effective in giving that `` wow '' factor .
if you have other options for a restaurant and steak , i would suggest heading elsewhere . the bathrooms were pretty neat , where there were lights on the ceiling and see-through glass floor , where it kind of resembles the bottom of an ocean .
great food at a very reasonable price .
although the prices can be high it really was n't outrageous .
keeping up with the appearance of the store is also important so the concrete floors was a turn off , at least acid stain it .
i know most beer drinkers prefer piss like corona and budweiser and heineken , but us beer snobs are kind of left in the cold it seemed .
my server today was todd w. and he was exceptional !
however , the potato wedges were awful .
went here today for a late lunch/early dinner and service is superb .
the bartender was great and helped me decide between the pink lemonade and peach iced tea - i went with the peach iced tea and it was a great choice .
we usually go to durants for special occasions as it 's been our favorite for 16 years , but thought we would try arrowhead grill .
it 's quick and convenient , and the staff is super friendly .
was very loud in there .
might be why . anyway , disappointed .
we enjoyed 2 delicious glasses of wine .
it looked like the decorator thought they were designing a buffet . it could be very sexy and dark with the egyptian theme , but they failed .
the cheesecake is very good when hot because its soft and fluffy .
always nice to think of a new restaurant to go to in summerlin .
as for alcohol it 's bottled beer and a few selections of wine only here .
beer was good too and they even had drinks even if do n't drink beer .
even the normal price of $ 9 is a lot for a crappy buffet that serves nasty food .
extremely reasonably priced , great value .
staff was very helpful and friendly and they are off to a great start .
really delicious food and drinks and wine selection .
i do love the architecture and interior design , but idk , it 's kinda dark and depressing , and not up to date with alot of stuff . my room was kinda crappy and did not have a flat screen like in the picture .
neat little place ; cool laid-back atmosphere , just a great little place .
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
the lamb & clam casino was great for sharing and had four huge clams , served in their shells .
the service from the two bartenders at the time were super nice and got my group our new player cards .
not particularly cheap either for a run-of-the-mill lunch , i paid about $ 18 for my entree , 1/2 guac , ... and a water .
it is reasonably priced .
i love this place dearly .
if you 're able to book a weekend for under $ 200 consider it a steal .
i would love to say the decor is delightfully tacky , but it 's not . it 's just plain tacky .
you do n't need to be able to see every inch of it , but it 's a little weird to have creepy bathroom mood lighting .
one more thing , it is very stupid to have your view ruined by the beatles banner that covers all the top floors which are the suites , you get nice big floor to ceiling windows and you ca n't see very well out the window because of it , so disappointing .
warning : i got bad food poisoning after eating here .
even enjoyed the chickpea fries .
parking was easy . our server was super nice and attentive !
however , there are some serious issues with their service : - at lunch time , even though there may be only one or two customers ahead of you , it will still take over 10 minutes - tried calling in an order to speed it up .
it 's a chunk of cheap grilled lettuce lightly drizzled in caesar dressing with a piece of burnt chicken next to it and this weird cheese wafer thing .
as a night club , rumfish is great . beach atmosphere in bridgeville pa !
prices are surprisingly reasonable .
broccoli was cool , fries were good , but about 10 % were burnt .
room was nice , but expected more . hallway was dirty , bathroom ceiling had hair stuck to it , ( gross ) , no coffee maker or refrigerator .
the margaritas and drinks are all very bland and watered down despite what they advertise as `` 1800 '' tequila .
there was no wait and the cost ( ~ $ 35/person ) was pretty inexpensive compared to other casino buffets .
they can also be so rude .
not too expensive either ... about $ 30 bucks for 2 beers , an an entree and an appetizer .
its outdated and although clean but needs a touch up may be a lil paint .
just kind of ghetto in a way .
however , the fact that i 've been overcharged on both of my previous two visits by over $ 2.50 each time is just ridiculous .
draft beer selection was not extensive , but they offered tastings ( poured more than fairly ) and the beers they had were really good .
nice to have craft beer on tap and bottle . should n't be in a chilled glass though .
the interior is very outdated and felt kind of dirty .
$ 43 for two people for cold ass food is robbery .
they have a full bar with decent selection of beers on tap , by the bottle and wine .
the restaurant is a simple , charming place .
i wish this was the kind of response i received while i was still a guest but it 's good to see they do follow through and follow up .
is very friendly , he comes around and welcomes you .
beer wise , stick to bottles .
the food was tasty and the chicken was good quality meat .
do n't recommend ! did n't even get my entire order then the pizza looked like it was microwaved a pinch of cheese on the cheese bread !
furthermore , the prices are super reasonable .
disappointing all around . beer was ho-hum .
she is completely surprised and told us the meals had to come to our table .
finally , one of them looked at me and said that someone would help me momentarily .
the prices are reasonable .
love this place . definitely a foodie must try .
my girlfriend had the margarita on the rocks and it was syrupy sweet .
i went for lunch this time , and it was great !
we ordered the high society and the thrifty cocktail of the day which featured chamomile and was served in a tea cup .
the grilled meat was awesome .
the outside tables add a nice atmosphere .
they 're asian selection was okay , they had pot sticker , shu mai , some kind of noodle which i thought was too bland .
it is incredibly bland .
my meal was hugely salty , due to what seemed like heavy use of soy sauce , instead of a more sophisticated cooking .
it is n't the worst bbq i 've ever had , but it ranks at the bottom .
however , the ribs were over cooked and chewy . while the mussels were hit or miss with some not really hot and the accompanying fries completely soaked in the broth .
they had a good selection of beers and something i 'd never seen before , jameson on tap . i 'm very curious as to how liquor on tap works ( and why a mexican restaurant had whiskey on tap instead of tequila ) but we did n't have the time to stay and investigate .
sure , i can spend my $ 60 on better things , but part of the cost is the experience .
no more mood lighting , no more fancy chairs and tables and the food was awful .
good value for the price .
the sake was also a great experience .
the salad was extremely soggy due to all the dressing and the potatoes were not fully cooked or even hot for that matter .
the sides had no flavor and was n't even warm .
the location was nice and easily accessible with a decent amount of parking nearby , the restaurant itself was very cozy and quaint with acceptable lighting and decor .
price are very reasonable .
only 3 stars because the price is so high for what you get .
the service is fast and the food was good : i had the chilli soup and meatball sandwich and they were very good .
no return for sure .
the drink prices are a little higher than you 'd expect - the aria is one of the only casinos on the strip that does n't have a starbucks , so your run of the mill chai latte will run you around $ 6 bucks as opposed to $ 4 at starbucks .
everything we 've ordered has been delicious and as described .
the people that work here are really nice and welcoming and it 's a cool environment .
the pizza was excellent . super cheesy and the dough was just the proper thickness .
overpriced . decent food .
the rice was ok but the beans looked dried out and not appealing .
this is a very conveniently located and friendly location . the staff here are very attentive and helpful as well as courteous to newcomers .
my delicious meal came with complimentary chips and salsa ( choice of hot or mild ) . the hot was hot , but deliciously addicting .
i guess when your restaurant is this bad you are used to people complaining .
i 've been to a few panda 's in my years and i 've never had noodles be so dry nor rice so bland .
tacos where lightly served with meat , pico really was bland , no seasonings .
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
excellent selection of beer , reasonably priced . the food is acceptable .
the `` seasonal veg '' that i opted for instead of mash or fries was string beans again done poorly and 2 pieces of terrible tasting squash or corn , could n't tell as there was no seasoning .
we stopped and went in to find a great menu and prices !
i was not happy that my combo plate , which i thought would cost me under 8 dollars ended up being 12 or 13 dollars .
leah was a fantastic server .
great place for late night dining . quick service and food is fast .
watching others around the restaurant who were finally being served after waiting just as long as us , their food was not coming out all together .
oh and very reasonable prices .
the sandwiches were always a little soggy & i remember them putting a ton of sauce on the pasta dishes ( the sauce itself was n't bad , but i do n't care how good sauce is , i do n't want my pasta drowning in it ) .
the frozen drinks were not that great either and kind of expensive , $ 20 dollars each .
tastes almost like real chicken .
beautiful design ! i been here recently .
unfortunately is what the most expensive thing on their menu , but for $ 12 it was priced just right for me .
i noticed a decent beer selection but was disappointed to hear that they had no drink specials .
we were told that our meal was going to be compted , but when the check arrived they only took off our drinks ( $ 3.00 ) . however , the people next to us got their entire meal compted for their , lesser wait .
brisket , pulled pork , chicken - but no matter what - you must try the hot links in their homemade bbq sauce .
could n't drink but beer menu looked awesome too .
meh . got delivery and it was pretty bad .
i was not at all disappointed .
atmosphere : it 's a nice restaurant with a modern touch .
after mixing the alcohol and slushie together with my straw - i was a pretty happy camper .
had i ordered this as my entree i would have been very disappointed as it was $ $ $ $ expensive .
lin and his crew are awesome too ! they always greet us and are super friendly .
it tasted good , but i lacked heat .
the food was extremely over salted .
the sweet topping poured over the top was gelatinous and just covered the entire dessert .
we are excited to return for date night !
service was good and prices are reasonable .
however i did find the pasta to be a little on the hard side . i also got to taste the fettucine and while it was the correct softness i found it to be a bit too bland .
we were pleased to see happy hour everyday with great drink prices .
manager was a little rude .
all of the food pretty much tastes like it was frozen with a lot of salt and butter .
the thin crust was perfect , the sauce was a tomato paste base , which is the best way to make sauce .
dim lighting makes it incredibly difficult to read , and i 'm not old !
both of these options were beautiful and delicious .
it 's a cute gimmick but if you are into food and service and can afford more than $ 5 a meal , i would avoid this place .
husband had the dragon soup & i think he licked the bowl clean .
i was warned ... `` do n't get fooled by the pretty colors and sparkly lights ! ''
the gentleman on the phone barked orders at me to the point where i was n't even mad , just confused .
my only complaint is that it was really loud in there .
when we tasted the pizza , it was ... okay . the sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland .
also , try to find free parking around the area while you 're down there .
decent turkish cuisine with reasonable price and good service . tried shish and chicken adana kabab , it was great !
speaking of price , everything is more expensive than magic noodle by about 1-2 dollar .
you 're only a billion dollar company that ca n't afford the electric bill anymore ? guess that remodel went over budget .
they 're a little proud of their pastries , and everything costs about a $ 1 more than it should .
this is one of my favorite restaurants in phoenix -- the best things on the menu imo are the short ribs and shrimp and grits .
unlimited mimosa and the beautiful bottle of chianti as a gift was a plus .
we were near a window which was nice .
( highchairs , counter space , etc ) let me start with one of the cooks near the meat section , who very loudly , told me to `` hurry up there 's other people here . ''
the right side is adjacent to the open kitchen .
the staff is great !
pizza was bland , poorly cut , with minimal subpar toppings .
it 's a bit expensive .
the price is a bit high but its an airport restaurant .
great food with great vegetarian options portion sizes are small but you can easily get full off ordering several dishes ! the salads are great and so is the risotto !
the carving station offered a brisket that could have only been prepared by a rookie since it had no smoke ring and was as tough as a rubber sole . stay clear of the latin station everything was over cooked .
i have had the lunch buffet 3 times and they were great . great selection with the food being fresh and tasty .
prices overall are not bad , happy hour is decently priced but not huge discounts .
excellent drinks , especially mine !
the food is authentic italian . the ambiance is relaxing but classy .
ca n't say much for the decor- tables and chairs are rickety and the decor bland .
price is reasonable too .
they accommodated . service was solid and they tossed in a free dessert ( not sure why ... said `` congrats '' on it ... .but we never told them we were celebrating anything ) .
the decor was nice , but is that paint color blush of bashful ?
i think there were only 3 or 4 beers offered , draft and bottled .
amazing smoked meat . the best part ?
prices are reasonable , service is n't too bad and portions are decent .
my wife had bacon and escarole quiche that was light and yet creamy , really delicious .
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
the food was great and came in immense portions with plenty of leftovers for two more meals .
it 's not cheap but with such high quality food , you should expect to pay a bit more .
plus , the place was full of area locals when we arrived , which is always a good sign .
started out with an amazing pina colada with toasted coconut on the edge of the glass .
this place is great for watching almost any sports game , they have tv 's in every angle and all around you .
the selection is pretty good and prices were pretty reasonable .
kc also recommended a drink that was n't on the menu that was made or rose wine and some type of blueberry vodka that was just absolutely divine !
i do find it amusing how `` hipster '' the establishment seeks to feel with tattooed employees and rustic decor ... yet much of the clientele is overtly b & t , sigh ( not dive 's fault ) .
wonderful place to grab a quick dinner or a fun night out with friends and family .
the interior 's nothing fancy but it was n't uncomfortable and was fun to read some of the signs on the wall .
all in all , a very cute date spot . i love the lawn in the back !
all of the staff was very kind and helpful .
rice was fine , but only so-so .
the bartender was very friendly and the pours of wine were generous .
and are welcomed by the host right away .
or sit down in their clean eatting area and watch some tv . highly recommend
the only turn off is a nasty exterior access bathroom .
i ca n't wait to try this place again ! great salsa and atmosphere .
the atmosphere is charming , warm and inviting .
the meatballs were mushy & flavorless ... ... sauce was mediocre at best .
it was a great room to watch the sunrise from the first morning and a nice spot to watch the people jump from the tower .
excited to try more .
food took forever to get : ( food finally came and was definitely a 4 out of 5 but i have to drop the rating due to the poor service .
otherwise , if you 're in north chandler this is a great place to enjoy east indian food .
their prices are very reasonable and when getting the tacos it is a great deal .
cash only ! even though there are signs everywhere , we somehow missed them .
no draft beers which was a bummer , but still a decent selection of bottled beers .
the selection of draft beers looked o.k . nothing outstanding but their bottle selection sucked .
the only downside is that you will literally pay $ 16- $ 24 for a cocktail .
dinner for two and a bottle of decent merlot went for just under $ 100 .
there were the normal beer options ( no craft ) and the wine was barefoot so nothing to write home about .
not bad but that 's what i get for being a spas !
i normally would praise the server by name , but i lost the receipt .
everything was delicious , fresh ingredients , the service was amazing .
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
the lighting was nice , i could see my food but was n't blinded by lights .
i will never give this place my business , make your money while you can , because people will only put up with this shit for so long . learn to turn your tables .
all the dishes were very flavorful and delicious .
what i really enjoyed was that they had a variety of flavors and so many choices .
pretty dirty environment ( after all , it is tempe ) and awkward , crammed seating arrangement .
love the drinks here !
needless to say , i was disgusted .
there 's a good wine selection and awesome appetizers .
the decor was tacky to begin with and now its just looking tired and dusty .
it 's like being invited to go behind the cash registers in a retail store because when you come in through the to-go door you are supposed to stand directly behind the computers used to keep track of to-go orders .
that was find , but we ordered 2 chicken tacos ... terrible !
personally , the drink was a bit strong in alcohol yet way too sweet .
the atmosphere is very good and although it 's a bit warm , the place is quiet enough that you 're not bothered .
the employees are nice and the outdoor seating is a really great environment .
i did no drink one , but apparently the margaritas were pretty good and not a bad deal by the pitcher .
+ cool seating areas , spacious , lots of outlets , some outdoor seating , convenient to campus . - average drinks ( no signatures ) , baristas not as familiar with drinks , pay parking .
their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers .
smells wonderful , taste terrific and we would come back here again . the staff was so kind and helpful .
drinks were a little weak but draft beers worked well enough .
also , for a wine bar , i was not super impressed with the wine selection .
my usual order is the boneless chicken roti , the roti bread has a nice texture and the chicken is cleaned well ( no nasty bits of gristle , etc ) .
the bathroom was really dirty , a real turn off .
while we did not drink any booze , they appeared to have a good selection of craft beers , wine , and specialty cocktails .
the drinks were great .
the restaurant decor is a cool student artsy vibe , small tables , jam-packed full of people .
they have got really great pizza sauce as well .
could n't wait to try this restaurant with its weird name and kitschy deco .
great bar and tv 's to pass the time .
the prices are awesome though .
terrible service however ... i ordered a bento box and clearly stated which one .
the arrogant butcher kept only the most expensive dishes leaving you no choice but to spend twice than you normally would .
our waiter was also awesome and attentive .
after work we stopped by to give it a go . i 'm glad we did .
the veggie burger is great and fills you up . the pineapple pizza also very delicious
the bartending staff was very friendly and helpful .
the balance of the ingredients ( bleu cheese , arugula ) was amazing and felt very tasty .
both servers were incredibly nice and despite it being close to closing time , they were very upbeat !
great food and they have a dog-friendly patio . the service is also amazing .
perfect to have a drink with friends !
it 's kind of dark and depressing .
definitely get a drink because their tea selection and drink selection is wonderful .
prices are pretty good .
it is a great value .
the takeout box was filled to the rim with rice while only a thin layer of meat sitting atop .
with a drink , i still feel it 's a bit expensive $ 16 for a take out !
i also got a cadillac margarita that tasted like they just lazily put the alcohol and margarita mix .
the lunch prices are great .
the food was enjoyable as well . very fresh , tasty and well prepared .
when i say drinks i mean sodas - no special bar drink or something .
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
very basic . super expensive !
our server was great and super friendly .
and not sure why all the clutter in the hallway towards the bathroom .
the prices are a little high for the dining fare , but i suppose , you are paying for the view .
it would be a good place to hang out and read a book without feeling like your selling your soul to the trendy hipster gods .
the tonkotsu ramen is fantastic , as is the fried rice with the pork option . we also enjoy the diversity and price of the combo meals .
this place has it all for one price like a high priced spread at the vegas casinos only for a much lower price .
ok. the decor is all neon lights and straight out of the 80 's which was actually kind of endearing .
but the entrees were disappointing .
the prices where a bit high but if you like really good steak then you will have to pay .
the prices are also very reasonable when you consider the quality .
the quiche is wonderful and the baguette perfectly fluffy and chewy .
but again , we come here for the food and this is our favorite place to eat in scottsdale , in arizona , in any where we 've been .
very expensive but worth it for a special occasion .
the drinks were also made great .
wine and cocktails also great .
i 'm pleased with the menu variety too .
oh and the strawberry kiwi drink was great even the large piece of watermelon was sweet .
it is also reasonably priced .
the drinks are done with a strong hand , which i loved !
prices are great , lots for your dollar .
$ .69 for not even a quarter of a small ramekin of cheese kinda ridiculous .
he loved looking at the beautiful lighting .
they also make a delicious moscow mule cocktail . i 've always made reservations so have never had to wait .
the burger was cooked to the right temp ( med rate ) but again lacked seasoning , and the protein while having a great texture was over whelmed by the bread , onion lettuce , etc .
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
customer service is horrible and food not nothing special , this place needs to go out of business.. do n't wait your money eating here .
poor customer service , prejudice against people not their own .
the restaurant layout was totally weird but who really cares .
we admired the view for a while , got significantly drunk , and then i capped the night off with a gin & tonic .
the food was extremely disappointing , the service was horrible and we sat at a tiny uncomfortable table .
the lighting was so bright i could n't stay .
i had a strawberry rhubarb sangria , so good !
we were seated in the backroom which had a nice intimate atmosphere .
only thing was i know the lighting is for ambiance and what not but its hard to read the menu with the lights so dim .
high quality food for a super reasonable price , what 's not to love ?
decor is tired and a bit threadbare .
in addition to having 5oz and full size glasses , they will let you sample some for free .
$ 5 i could swallow but $ 13 is effing stupid .
i had been wanting to try this place for awhile and i was so excited when i was finally able to go .
however , she did not ask the person if she wanted a replacement for the soup that was out of stock and walked away . fortunately , the person who ordered soup did not want a replacement .
also , the jalapeno margarita is excellent and they make a great moscow mule .
the beer was good and cold , but i think i would rather have a draft house beer .
when i brought it to the attention of the waitress , she agreed it was a little high before walking away .
good selection of signature drinks .
very reasonably priced , and clean .
beer and wine was unlimited , but they were serving only one type of beer .
it fell apart easily and the tastes did n't go well together .
my husband and i love this place . we go on a weeknight and service is great !
i guess i did n't understand the benihana seating plan . my advice is to make reservations and only show up with reservations , otherwise you 'll leave pretty pissed just like me .
when i said something i was treated as if i was wrong to speak up .
did n't get a drink but looked like a nice selection of beers on tap .
fantastic meal in a cool eclectic atmosphere .
the food is great here , also reasonably priced .
however , as the dd that night , i did n't appreciate having to ask for more water twice ( especially when one time the waitress was refilling the other side of the table but did n't notice the lack of water on my side ) .
reasonably priced good food .
pasty low mein , dried out rice , soggy cabbage , no mashed potatoes , chicken wings were sitting out way too long .
it was $ 8 a day max , so in total $ 40 for the duration of 5 days we stayed parked .
disappointing all around . beer was ho-hum .
the upgrade price for the sides was a little excessive at $ 2.50 for a side salad substitution , already on top of a $ 20 burger , but it is what it is .
the beer was good and cold , but i think i would rather have a draft house beer .
the free garage is right next to the entrance of the restaurant , so it 's simple and easy .
i will say that the drink selection was good and they had some good beers on tap .
the salad was bland .
we had them remake the pizza , which made it edible , but it was not enjoyable like before .
the prices are great .
it was definitely crowded so they must be doing something right
she did n't seem too sympathetic about it either .
at 6 bucks i could only laugh .
needless to say based on the change in the menu and the horrible service that i wo n't be going back anytime soon .
the prices are decent , especially for the quality of the food .
look was kind of drab .
the serving 's very generous and the price very cheap . the service is a-ok but not great .
great quality at a great price .
very friendly and bubbly .
such an delicious find ! i am new to the area and found this place .
i have never dined in here as i always get to go but im sure the service is great .
the service is average . inside the restaurant is quite nice , nicely decorated .
the cashier said it was the first time anyone 's ever asked for that , but she was happy to add it to my order .
love this place ! my kids do too .
the chicken was dry and old .
the portion for the price ( $ 8.95 ) was very reasonable .
very good . prices are reasonable .
good selection of drinks and beer on tap but i was dissapointed they did n't have a drink menu so we had no idea what anything cost .
$ 38 is very cheap for the quality of food and the service we received .
the restaurant itself is pretty minimal , big paint words like smash and burger all over the walls .
when i politely requested the correct order , our waiter was so rude and brought me udon noodles instead .
this is a great authentic thai restaurant . papaya salad is fresh and delicious .
we got the mussles , pulpo , grilled wings and skewers and everything was delicious .
their tomato soup is pretty good as well . the price point ( $ 6- $ 8 ) is pretty good for the amount of food you are getting especially with the usual marked up vegas prices !
but the beer was disappointing .
we could n't have received any better service . the waitress was right their and willing to get anything we needed .
i asked for sauteed salmon on the salad but out it came with no salmon unfortunately .
awesome for a little bite but you might need to buy 2 slices ( $ 10 at least )
absolutely terrible , no one greets you at the entrance , waiter was friendly but standing around looking at his phone the whole time .
however , this dish is served with only 4 ravioli 's , priced at $ 16-18 , that 's $ 4+ per ravioli .
the rum drinks are creative and delicious .
went on a saturday night and they place was very popular .
cash only may be awkward but it 's better than higher prices !
i would highly recommend this place for anyone to try .
great service . amazing pizzas .
we had a couple beers and glasses of wine but not a bottle or hard liquor .
we did a 3 course lunch that is only $ 20.12 and i would have paid 3 times that and not felt ripped off .
service was slow ( not our waiter ) and we only had 3 in our party and it was 230 on a sunday afternoon , restaurant was not even half full .
this is my favorite restaurant !
not yet living here but visiting to search out a new abode , husband and i were staying in a nice hotel downtown and now were in search of a `` date night '' venue , a quiet venue with a bit of ambiance ( but not over the top ) and subdued lighting to have some wine and a scrumptious meal .
i went for my birthday and enjoyed the food . i do wish the restaurant was bigger seems a bit cramped in there but it has a lovely atmosphere and is nicely decorated .
they barely had any beers on tap , had no jack daniels , but did make a pretty good moscow mule .
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
the way the painful fluorescent lighting reflects off the bright yellow walls is almost genius in its awfulness .
my favorite part of the meal , however , was the sparkling rose ' , of which i had two glasses .
but this one has chandeliers . note the plural : seriously , there are like 10 chandeliers .
it was friday night at 7 and the place was filling up but not crazy , there were open tables and outside seating and we were still finishing our drinks when the manager came over to our table and asked us to leave because they were desperate for tables .
so , cool location , good size restaurant , pretty views of caesar 's palace & also of the strip .
to-go orders are packed carefully . great location to people-watch from their window seats .
the food is also reasonably priced , and really good .
enter through a pawn shop , pass the bar and go into the beautiful dimly lit spacious restaurant .
the restaurant is cozy , yet it can get quite noisy when it is busy .
bad idea ! margaritas were ok but not booze in them !
huge selection of both wine and beers . outstanding .
great beers , bartenders do n't know anything about the beers . the menu is ok. not bad to pair beer with .
was drinking bottle beer so hard to not get that right .
every single item was delicious .
appetizer- fresh shrimp spring rolls & vegan crispy spinach . dinner- won ton soup & green curry with chicken .
and it was reasonable prices .
those cheddar biscuits were served warm and were to die for .
they are very reasonably priced too .
i loved the chili chicken and the shrimp kabob .
came for sunday brunch which was amazing ! jeffrey our server was the best ... .and all you can drink mimosas for $ 5.50 ca n't be beat !
the `` thing '' on the ceiling ... well , i 'm not sure of its purpose .
i am originally from sacramento , ca and this place is a city treasure !
good wines by the glass , and good , affordable reds by the bottle which you rarely get in these types of casual spots .
if you 're lucky there will be a jazz band playing in the adjoining lounge with a cool metal bead curtain and beautiful seating . a wonderful place to relax with a treat .
then i ordered a cappuccino that said it had 8 different liqueurs in it , however it was way too strong and was basically liquor , no cappuccino flavor .
they have a special right now , if you buy $ 50 in gift cards you get $ 10 free so we asked if we could do that and put it toward our meal tonight and they said sure !
reasonable prices as well .
very good food at very affordable prices .
first off $ 2.25 for a small taco with meat only is obscene .
and the pizzas were outstanding !
i also ordered the rose by the glass which went well .
we ate in the eiffel tower restaurant and it was just excellent and so romantic !
the h3 roll and the crazy rule were great .
it 's not super fancy but the decor was really nice .
the place seemed pretty busy when we left around 7. with its primarily wood interior , it had a cozy calming effect on diners .
the selection was very poor as far as bottled beers and what was on tap .
the noodles were good and reasonably priced .
the prices are modest .
( warning : the entire place is very dark and it is difficult to read the menu without glasses and/or a flashlight . )
i get the fact of the hipster décor and approach to almost anything that involves food nowadays , but old christmas decorations lining the walls it just ridiculous .
it was pretty good food . reasonable price too .
price and quality area good !
be sure to check out the huge mural on the north wall .
so glad we did !
for less than eight dollars , this is an insane deal you can not pass up !
the atmosphere was beautiful , clean and relaxing .
great food . the tom yum soup was delicious and the spring rolls as well .
ok one weird thing - in the men 's restroom is a urinal that looks like a horse trough .
food is priced excellently and overall was great ! $ 5.50 for a plate of chicken and rice !
we also got a chicken dish that tasted like chicken .
the food is very good , moderately priced though not `` cheap '' and the portions are good .
priced in the $ 6.00 to $ 9.00 range , not bad price for the food served .
not crazy about the decor though .
the food is very good and it is reasonably priced .
good healthy food at a reasonable price .
i 'm so glad to have the kind bean so close to home !
just saying i love this place however the $ $ $ $ on yelp should n't be four . amazing wings but hey yelp fix the cost this place is a good deal and not pricy .
the staff was loud , obnoxious and completely unapologetic . the garbage cans were overflowing .
let 's see : bad lighting , uncomfortable sheets , water so hard if you use a wash cloth on your skin with it you could potentially tear the skin right off your body , an ac unit that just does n't work , terribly thin walls and you can see the light coming in from the hallway -- hope you 're not expecting privacy !
i 'm kind of creeped out sitting at a table and seeing how dirty the booths are , even in the very dim lighting .
as others have mentioned , this is a great place to get your new mexico food experience .
the layout is almost uncomfortable and haphazard in a neat and orderly way somehow .
at the time i went there were only skinny crab legs and they were really salty .
they only charge $ 1 for it , which is well worth the price ( and , of course , whatever you decide to tip ) .
i ordered the pimm 's cup , and it is a refreshing cocktail with hints of mint .
great atmosphere and the prices are more than reasonable .
drinks were all great .
ok - and what is with the creepy baby face on the menu and decor ?
there is a menu posted at the entrance and you order at the counter , grab a number , get your beverage and seat yourself in the comfortable farmhouse style dining room or the attractive patio .
dude , it 's not clean .
this place has a good beer selection and a nice list of bourbon specialty cocktails .
disappointed they did n't have liquor but only wine or beer - had to order sangria .
down sides , took far to long for a bar drink and glass of wine .
i enjoyed the pineapple curry very much . chicken satay was nice and surprisingly tender .
i was a bit disappointed that they did n't have draught beer but enjoyed the selection of cans and bottles .
we had the lobster bisque to start ( so good ) .
the decor is great and modern .
good prices and a great selection .
beer menu is severely limited with only one or two decent beers not made by budweiser .
the blueberry was the best of the 3 , but i 've eaten better elsewhere . the pancakes were overpowered by one ingredient and the artificial flavoring was `` no bueno . ''
seating in the bar area is more comfortable and cozy . the upstairs dining area is a little stark and noisy .
fast , plenty and reasonably priced .
they give you some cheap discounts like $ 20 drinks per night .
beers were good ( even though they didnt have any beer specials ) ... hmmmm .
my iced tea was always full .
we ordered the mussels and eggplant appetizers which were both amazing .
i 'm not a huge fan of sweet cocktails , but a friend wanted to give their drinks a try .
their assortment of sours was also absolutely delicious ( we ended up taking a few cans home . )
the church is beautiful .
we were seated right away but it took what seemed like 10 minutes before anyone asked us for drinks and apps .
to drink i had the rose lychee lassi and it was really yummy !
i think there were only 3 or 4 beers offered , draft and bottled .
service is always polite and have had many good recommendations .
pretty decor , but we found the lighting odd .
i had the sangria ( pitcher of course ) and it tasted pretty darn good .
it 's a super small space with a very open concept .
points for the decor though - the chandeliers were very pretty albeit seemed a little out of place .
the bar had a drink special .
food was very good and fairly priced .
great views no matter which side you are looking at .
without the groupon , it would 've been around $ 11 ( steep , but right around chipolte ) .
the decoration is gorgeous .
the weather was beautiful and i wanted to dine outside , haberdish has a patio . the restaurant is quaint and the patio seating was fine .
a couple beers each , a sandwhich each for around $ 30.00 , ridiculously great deal .
the shrimp were not eatable and i had to scrap the coating off to eat chunks of tasteless shrimp .
we have visited several times and have been completely satisfied with food and great service .
since they re did this place they are hardly out of anything !
the prices are very reasonable .
it took a ridiculous 20 mins to finally get our order ... a runner brought our order so we could n't even order food cuz our server had n't touched our table .
they serve duckhorn cab by the glass , which was a pleasant surprise !
the price is reasonable .
being that the portion size was just perfect they were also able to enjoy a sweet empanada as well .
we did n't try any beer but the beer list was impressive .
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
i can now proudly say i am a weekly customer of great priced food that can satisfy any craving after a night out .
the taiyaki is cute and different . the cafe is really cute too .
the setting is also very beautiful as it is right in schenley park with views of the cathedral of learning .
the tile and fixtures were falling off the wall in the bathroom . the bed was rock hard .
they appear to have a pretty big list of beer , but i do n't drink beer !
i think everyone at our table had either wine or beer ( they have an ok beer selection , but nothing fancy , and only bottles ) .
additionally bought a six pack of miller lite there for $ 7.50 , had a draft and that was kinda expensive at $ 3.50
the portions were just right , and the flavor pairings were perfect .
the fish was the best by far and next time we would just order fish and chips , although the chicken was juicy and tender and the shrimp was good but the batter was on the sweeter side . the fries were cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside but still soft potato on the inside and salted perfectly .
view : very nice view of the conservatory . nothing you ca n't see walking through the conservatory itself though .
outdoor seating was nice and not too loud .
thank god , as sometimes they are not hot after all the ingredients are added .
they also gave me an awesome deal i could n't resist and i love the raspberry lemonade .
just be warned its a cigar bar too . so do n't be surprised to see people smoking a stick .
that 's cool - unless you write `` freaky fast '' all over your walls ; - )
service and rolls are great .
firstly : the restaurant name does n't give enough credit to the classy interior .
edamame corn fritters were amazing , loved the sauce .
the staff is nice and they serve quickly .
also , good selection of beer , 15 tap beers and about that many in a bottle .
very doubtful , she walked from her cash register at the take-out window and had the meal already prepared so she had it for a while .
i will say that the drink selection was good and they had some good beers on tap .
towels everywhere , questionable fluids on the floor , just completely dirty .
i was really good delivered but excellent fresh which was expected .
fantastic neighborhood pub . friendly staff and great food .
one thing i absolutely love is their desserts !
the chicken wings were spectacular , and the chef sent over some complimentary ones because the ones we got were n't up to his standards ( they looked and tasted good to us ) .
loving the new location .
our waitress was pleasant and helpful .
the beer selection was solid , but i would n't come here for cocktail or anything . beer and shots only .
i highly recommend the shrimp dumplings , noodles , and pork & corn dumplings .
we ordered a house wine and a draft beer , nothing complicated .
they have added restaurants and a nice outdoor area .
i went in to purchase a meal for a homeless man that was hungry and the clerk at the counter proceeded to be loud and very rude .
food is well priced and is actually decent . service is great .
the bathroom is dirty , which was turn off for me .
the friendly staff will make your experience a good one .
the valet staff was courteous and quick as well - yes , we valet everywhere , as parking and walking cuts into our valuable gambling time !
employees were nice and very helpful .
the food is n't that unhealthy fried stuff sitting in oil like other happy hours , in even the priciest restaurant .
it tasted like it was in the freezer for a while and very poor , store bought quality .
sorry , not impressed ! i felt like we were bothering the waitress .
we tried the manchurian which was watery and bland .
the wine parings chosen for each course were perfect for what i was eating , i love good wine .
i loved the atmosphere and wine selection .
very good food and typical prices .
food was delicious , including the appetizers , main courses , and deserts .
i would definitely recommend sitting on the patio if it is nice outside .
for as great as the wynn is , this just does n't hit the mark for $ 39 a head .
the prices are fantastic .
the drink selection was so lame .
great service , friendly staff .
i drank my free mimosa with glee , and drank jim 's with even more fervor .
there was a green stain on one of the bathroom towels and everything was just dingy , stained and disgusting .
ordered alcohol drinks and they were strong .
a plethora of negative signs : `` bathrooms only for patrons . ''
the beer selection was pretty poor so i ended up with a whiskey cocktail instead .
a few of my favorite dishes are the yellowtail jalapeno , mushroom salad , spicy tuna roll , black cod miso and the bento dessert box .
price is great for lunch .
their drink selection is great and there is always a special on wines and/or cocktails . enjoy !
i think she was 12. margaritas were hot and tasted like there was no tequila in it .
it 's fast and easy , but not the cheapest . but is anything is vegas cheap ?
it 's a beautiful space and an expansive patio .
$ 8 when i went for full size one .
went to pravda on a wednesday night and had a great time sipping cocktails and trying side-by-side tastings of vodka .
dirty beer glasses , sullen server , slow service and wrong order served !
the food is good , however the staffing pattern is terrible .
great specials and drinks .
prices are great , sushi is really good for the price . super great value .
prices are very fair .
the chicken wings were well cooked but were n't very flavorful . the takoyaki was great .
food good . service mediocre at best ... 10 workers three customers and no greeting at all ... made me feel like i was bothering him ...
this place has a great view of the strip , great service , awesome food and an amazing dj .
best flavors are original hot and bbq .
this place is so good !
i discovered it driving by and have been here every week to grab smoothies and cookies and even their lunch is good .
but there is no reason to be rude to your customers
me being a beer drinker they had a decent selection .
the milkshake was like cold milk with chunks of strawberries in it .
by far the best restaurant to eat at downtown for casual or non casual dining , lunch or dinner ! love the service i always get !
it was a warmer day and a corona sounded good , however , they had a decent craft beer selection and full bar .
the rigatoni is freaking awesome .
the two sandwiches came out to about $ 18 , including a $ 3 delivery charge ( which is likely much less than what a taxi would 've cost ) .
the atmosphere is definitely casual and i 'm pretty sure it 's a good spot for the service industry crew to come after work later at night .
the prime lamb and shrimp with heads off were a great choice .
they kept checking up on us and would give us what we needed and wanted without so much as an unfriendly gesture , but the food was n't spectacular .
everyone was wonderful and helpful .
the fries were so stale and cold that my appetite was lost completely .
we ordered the beef satay and spicy cucumber for appetizer . the beef satay was delicious !
great drink prices and good for shooting pool and hanging out with locals .
worst shrimp tempera i ever had . did n't expect awesome being a mall sushi place but damn it was bad .
i 'm giving it a 4 star because i felt like the decor was a little cheesey ... the food is amazing ... it deserves matching surroundings .
the price ( approx $ 20 for regular seats and $ 28 for premium ) seems reasonable to me -- especially considering how rarely i make it to a movie .
great vibe and service .
total after tax was 29 bucks , and thats a lot of money for just one pie .
the pricing was surprisingly reasonable .
my husband and i loved this place .
the cheeseburger was extremely underwhelming , the `` brioche bun '' was in fact a slice from a loaf of brioche , the cheese tasted cheap and there was no bacon as advertised . the poke was o.k .
it 's a romantic setting with exceptional service .
i came here for a group work lunch a week ago and had a hard time choosing what to get because there were so many great options .
blah . no one was mean and bottled beer is bottled beer but i might as well have stayed home .
the $ 4 daily cocktail special is pretty legit .
i truly do not understand the bad reviews .
the staff was friendly , and the service was fast !
i ca n't pinpoint it , unless it 's just that hotel bars swarmed with people wearing name badges are low key depressing .
ca n't beat the price . sides are good .
you want real , honest-to-god authentic tacos , or quesadillas or burritos , served with a bevy of scrumptious salsas - not tomato sauces passed up for salsa in the us in general ... .
the beer is cold and i have mixed drinks about feelings .
beverage prices , very reasonable .
very nice atmosphere and friendly service , our waitress was very attentive and the manager was making rounds and checking in with each of the tables also . extremely impressed overall !
the service if friendly and prompt . the owners are pleasant and outgoing .
the girls had skinny margaritas that came in what looked like `` toy '' glasses and had hardly any tequila .
when he finally came over we explained our frustration and that we had to leave and he said that he could credit us the $ 14.95 but would we take a gift card .
i had a mojito and that was delicious as well .
if it is really busy make sure you order all at once because you will not see the server for another 15 minutes .
i love the modern beer hall look they have going on . the food is mediocre but just a good place for casual place to hang out .
the `` pork two ways '' is phenomenal as the pork belly is perfect .
nothing was outrageously priced either .
i do n't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine .
was able to get a 2 for 1 deal and paid $ 27 . if not i would have spend over $ 50 and be very upset because even with the price of $ 27 , it was n't very good at all .
good , quick food at a reasonable price .
i find this to be a great spot to get some reading or work done .
got ta say , i like it more then hot noodles cold sake .
great place to spot by and try .
the chicken was ok. the garlic ones were a little bland and the spicy ones were actually spicier than i expected .
not so great if you want to sit down and has a relaxing chat .
if you can try to get a sit outside because inside is usually pretty loud and you might get your drinks faster , the bar is usually crowded .
-- fries - hot and crispy -- chop salad - large and fresh . very flavorful .
it 's just cooked perfectly and mingles wonderfully in the stew . and that stew .
huge portions and taste great .
the chicken was juicy and flavorful , the potatoes were delicious , and the sauce covering it was a nice touch .
not too shabby considering everything is effing expensive here .
top sirloin steak with garlic mashed potatoes and béarnaise sauce and it was marvelous . the steak was cooked to perfection .
outdoor patio is a enjoyable experience -- day or night !
came here saturday around 1. the live singer was great , just a little too loud .
also loved sitting out at their patio as well .
their pancakes were nothing too special though , was expecting a little better .
the price is inexpensive ( kinda ) and the menu is pretty straight forward .
tequila selection was pretty good but the bartenders were clearly hired for other credentials than tequila knowledge , if you catch my drift .
i had a turkey sandwich on their fresh baked bread and it was great !
prices are a bit pricier than they should be - but it is an affluent neighbourhood .
the worst part was the food from the caf .
i can understand if they were slammed pack with customers but there were only 5 tables occupied including ours .
great patio . live music , tasty food and good times .
great location with a great selection of stores : there is something for everyone here . i am alway happy to see a coach outlet and this location has one .
the ma po tofu and eggplant skillet were our favourite dishes - very flavourful . the kung bao chicken with peanuts and wonton soup were also really good .
the $ 32 lobster pasta came out with two ingredients ( mushrooms and peas ) that were not on the menu and the lobster was scarce . our service was good - ca n't blame the server for the problem with the food/menu .
good thing it is at a bar and i could get an ice cold draft beer .
we also had orange chicken , which was not the least bit spicy as the menu noted ... in fact crappy panda is spicier thank this , which was disappointing .
the one thing they really missed the mark on was the calamari and you do n't have to be a calamari snob like me to agree : - ) it was so so soggy and incredibly greasy .
the service was good and the desserts delicious , price was right $ 60 per person .
the atmosphere at this place is phenomenal - large and wide open with a great patio .
the price is obviously $ 1- $ 1.50 more expensive then tims but you get what you pay for !
the mani course was phenomenal ( steak frites ) . the steak was cooked perfectly , medium rare as i requested and exquisitely tender .
the worst of our experience was with a group of 10 , we were seated and immediately asked `` would you like tap or sparkling water ?
that nasty smokers scent is ingrained into every piece of furniture , walls , rug , etc .
when we decided to sit and eat , the outdoor seating was full and there appeared to be only one open seat front and center to some live guitar music . we were looking for something a bit quieter so we could talk and lucked out because their was seating in the cellar area .
the fruit drinks are a refreshing add-on .
i even once tried a pretty awesome jalapeno margarita but honestly i would rather drink the beer .
i also got a cadillac margarita that tasted like they just lazily put the alcohol and margarita mix .
the interior was very dull with pretty much no decor at all .
great food and waiters but please sort out the grumpy and inefficient staff who make you wait and feel unwelcome whilst waiting to be seated !
the beers were ok , nothing special .
while the prices are n't bad , you get what you pay for .
the manager refused to make more reservations , i 'm really disappointed .
there 's some ugly shit on the walls which made me wonder if i 'd like a hotel room better if the walls were bare .
if you 're downtown and craving chicken or other bww goodies , do n't hesitate to carry out .
the drink prices were reasonable .
the food is fine , overpriced like much of the restaurants in vegas , but not outrageous .
the food here is amazing . i have tried the iskender , manti and lahmacun so far , and they 've all been very good .
also , happy hour prices or not this place is affordable , and serves high quality food .
the last names was peeling off on the wall , even with tapes and pins on , it 's obvious and looking ugly on my photos .
quick and fast ! wontons are great , as well as their chilli oil .
the prices are very high .
that matters to me , i ca n't handle bright lights or loud noises .
nice relaxing place . good sized bar/lounge that gets very busy on the weekends .
instead , we were greeted in the large , modern , clean bar/restaurant by a lovely bartender and other friendly servers , and she quickly whipped up a margarita for me , and made sure i was aware of which ones were on the happy hour special , too ! ( the patron margarita was great and at $ 7 was a good deal . )
yet felt i needed to share how great this place is .
been here a couple of times and this location holds some sentimental memories for me .
while during my stay i saw many attendants in this area , but not one time did i not smell musty old urine soaked floors , dirty tile walls and disgusting stall walls ... .gross !
my tab was only ~ $ 40-45 , which is a fair price .
amazing food and great atmosphere ! i 'm obsessed !
no decor except four walls painted flat black and lined with televisions on them.. using the tv 's for lighting i think is so you do n't see what the fake food is ... the beer was cold .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
super rude to say the least .
it 's such a shame that poor customer service could be keeping people from checking this place out .
the girls in our group really enjoyed their moscow mule in the metal glasses , so definitely got that right .
plus a creative pizza menu and great atmosphere .
tender and incredibly flavorful ... .heaven in one bite !
once to have their cuban night special , which includes tapas plate , mojito and a cigar .
i felt totally distracted for some reason by the decor and ambiance .
came here when i visited vegas this past weekend & it was pretty good .
the cheese and fruit danishes are always awesome , just wish they were fresh or warmed up .
service again is awesome , they even have cocktail waitresses that serve alcohol with your dinner .
it was ok beer was not that great tasting you ca n't even buy a small glass of beer without buying a flight .
it was a good buger , but was it $ 12 ?
this bar is famous for their cable cars , a spiced rum cocktail served with a cinnamon/sugar rimmed martini glass .
it smells horrible , your shoes stick to the ground , there 's broken glass everywhere that they do n't clean up , it 's wall to wall people : so basically a huge fire hazard .
really nice place to stop in and try a flight of their delicious brew ! happy hour has the best 32oz pitcher prices .
run-down hotel , room is dirty ( there is a booger on the tissue box cover in the bathroom ) .
and a variety of vegan flavors from vanilla with sweet sriracha sauce to mint watermelon as well .
prices were reasonable too .
after one misstep ( i did n't care for the cucumber lime margarita ) , i switched to the superior margarita , and it was delicious !
waited to make sure this was n't a fluke .
the waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were .
both were unreal . the pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors in the sauces were truly mind blowing .
i feel confident in saying that i finally found a great stylist and look forward to the next visit !
we love the people watching there too !
i am excited to return !
but the food is great , the prices are decent too .
this is a really great spot for a quick brunch or lunch while shopping .
there was no color to indicate that they 'd been grilled or cooked at a high heat . and , there was no seasoning .
then , although our waiter was nice , he was slow to return to take our order .
their $ 20 char plate is very generous ( and delicious ) , and they carry one of my favorite rose wines by the glass . cheers !
cool retro décor that would be nice if it were clean .
i figure it might be due to the location , but i guess i do n't know for sure .
especially on the cocktails .
great flavor and cooked right .
when you walk in , the ceiling is covered in upside-down spinning umbrellas , immediately creating a light and whimsical atmosphere .
lets not forget the decoration that is ugly as well .
i will say the service was great and everyone in the place was friendly .
after seeing this we cancelled our order and left the shop . super disgusting .
great place to relax and check out the planes .
there was a selection of sake by the bottle , though i was surprised to find bottles to be hovering around the 750ml volume .
super fast service . will return .
the high ceilings permit a spacious vibe .
make sure and try the peach margaritas they are so delicious !
the dining atmosphere is quiet and elegant with a pleasantly minimalistic decor .
yes , i know its dancing water with stupid light bulbs shining through .
honestly the top 3 worst food i 've had .
was a little to salty . still good though .
the ganache topping was perfect and the raspberry preserves were melt-in-your-mouth incredible .
the decor is adorable and i really appreciate how clean it was .
the filling looks to be made with lean ground beefy , not at all dry or runny !
all of the food was cold .
i love hot sauce , i love cheesesteaks , ergo the satan steak .
it was the perfect amount of food and set the stage for a nice evening out . the wait staff was also very nice .
the ingredients are very fresh , and the chicken was nicely trimmed of any connective tissue or fatty bits - which is another issue i 've found all too common at other places .
the new server really only showed up to drop off the check .
do n't let the decor fool you , great vibes and music .
- yes , the bathroom looks like something out of the scariest of scary movies .
i did n't drink but the bottles and canned beer , as well as the wine , selection looked nice as well .
wow , we continue to be impressed everytime we come here .
the taste was n't anything special .
you do not need to make an unnecessary loud beep from the push of the buttons lol i was trying to adjust it while everyone was sleeping ... awkward .
i think it was nutella mousse ? i ate it there and it was not too sweet and surprisingly light .
we started out with a delicious gin cucumber cocktail which was so refreshing .
should make it inconvenient from there guest and the bands that play there.. they have no stage or lighting for bands . if you happen to sit where the band going to be set up you are asked to move to make room for band .
the rice was okay , but the slaw was pretty dry -- like just shredded cabbage .
i thought the pizza was greasy and it had no flavor.. the guy was very friendly though .
nachos and no beer does not make me happy .
we ordered our daiquiris and moscow mules ( free with a check-in on yelp ) and began to peruse the menu .
a little expensive , but you get what you pay for !
it 's a perfect midday lunch spot .
the basil was very sparse and did n't have that flavor i liked . my guy ordered a chicken italian one and it was very average .
the food was great ! the mac and cheese was my favorite .
the prices were very reasonable too .
plus the prices are very reasonable .
she 's super personable and a great server . food is amazing will definitely return .
i pretty much stick to my beer basics so i ordered a corona bottle .
mind you , these were two draft beers , one bottle , and a glass of wine and there was only one patron sitting at the bar .
the ambiance itself is pretty basic , dare i say even sterile .
drinks were great . i think everyone was happy with their drinks .
there 's nothing worse than when you 're paying a premium price for dinner , and the food is average and the service is bad .
that 's a really nice touch .
when we tried to order drinks , the were out of the only draft beer , negro modelo ... and 3-4 of the bottle beers , and my 1st tequila choice ... then the bartender actually told me the hefeweizen bottle beer was `` just '' like the 2x ipa they were out of ... .really ?
i did find that all the bright colors and decorations did a lot to brighten my mood at 3am .
the servers are very polite and attentive .
the service : this is why i wo n't be returning . it 's terrible .
the service was absolutely terrible !
very small for a 10 dollar margarita .
my husband joined me and we both had their signature cocktails that were absolutely refreshing .
i highly recommend this place .
we ordered a house wine and a draft beer , nothing complicated .
the tomato are super fresh marinated simple .
great place and reasonable prices .
the price is not bad .
they only had a few beers on tap , and none that were particularly exciting .
the customer service was great at night time and i loved the atmosphere .
the only knock is that there was no beer on tap ; bottle selection was good though .
they are pretty good but definitely over priced .
i ended up ordering a medium cup of lime and rum and nuts flavor . two completely different flavors with a mix of refreshing and liquor .
the drinks were superb .
its super cheap and a great deal . yeah its no gourmet food but its a great deal for the price .
when it came to the check it showed that none of the stuff we ordered was at the happy hour price .
their regular pizzas are all right , but hubby raves about the deep dish and the crispy burnt cheese crust ( which is actually awesome ) .
great little place , with awesome soda from glass bottles !
for the price . pretty damn good .
not too expensive either .
delicious ! woke this afternoon , my wife was having trouble finding which restaurant to go , so i yelped it !
drinks are reasonable in price . and the food was pretty good .
it 's not cheap , but it 's also not too pricey .
pretty good , especially for the price .
it is kinda loud but what do you expect from a place that is fast and cheap in prices .
wine list was good and price for wine was reasonable .
cornbread was plain and kind of dry too .
staff today are unhappy and have horrible attitudes when asked simple questions . waited almost 20 minutes for a bucket of nuggets while cups of nuggets were made and stored in warmer .
quick tasty meal , expertly crafted . get the pickled veggies as it adds good balance to the bowl .
margaritas are strong and on point . i 'll be back for sure !
super delicious . loved the beans and rice most of all .
the set up of the place is kinda awkward .
i came here for the first time tonight , and i am very impressed .
but after paying a dozen for $ 23 i 'll be going elsewhere from now on . sad .
consistently a satisfactory experience and , an awesome happy hour !
no alcohol this trip , but they do have a full bar , with 5 beers in tap .
the price at under 2 dollars was also great .
the ambiance is good and comply , perfect place to grab a coffee with friends and enjoy live music !
sahara location is huge , but definitely not a happening place . they have a ton of tvs and play these super annoying 80s videos !
great sushi , great service , great price !
the little ceasars pizza is every bit as good and only costs $ 5
not sure why we got such an attitude from the bartender . the only reason i gave 2 stars is the waitress who took over was very polite
beer was good too and they even had drinks even if do n't drink beer .
ambiance is on point - classy but not pretentious , dark and a bit on the romantic side .
their regular prices are ridiculously over priced , especially for the quality and taste of their food .
this is a great date restaurant with both the cool factor and good food .
the refillable water and lemon especially lovely and refreshing in the heat .
the girls had skinny margaritas that came in what looked like `` toy '' glasses and had hardly any tequila .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
my boyfriend got sushi which was ok but still not great .
the inside of the restaurant is dark , but elegantly appointed with a classic steakhouse vibe .
love the decor the have .
i had horrible food poisoning after eating the chow mein and orange chicken . i will not be returning .
the place has potential to do better .
great food for really good prices .
it was impossible to get in for about 12 guys and 8 girls so we had to slip the bouncers some cash .
the service was fantastic , and our server was very helpful and patient with the whole party .
the layout is kind of odd though .
omg . my favorite new place .
food came pretty quick and it 's a decent price .
i also enjoyed a wonderful sangria .
i rarely get sick with minimal cross contamination , so they must have done something pretty bad for me to have had such a violent reaction so quickly after consuming it .
only place open but we paid $ 14 for 2 slices .
the bartender was pretty bad .
unfortunately , this dish was greasy and did not taste very good .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
the flavor spot on the peppers had just the right amount of sweet .
unfortunately the red wine on tap was chilled which dulled the taste . the chardonnay on tap was better but tasted weak .
talk about a depressing background to your meal .
decided to take my business elsewhere because it does n't matter how good the food is , service is more important .
my friend paid ~ $ 88 for about 3 people , which was already expensive , and a basic alcoholic drink was $ 16 on its own .
the lighting was n't too bright or too dim , just right .
bottom line 4 star not 5 because of the loud atmosphere and the poor lighting .
but i thought the beers were mediocre .
a bunch of annoying punks as well in the parking lot , drunk as hell talking sh*t. did someone pass out a flyer of this place in the ghetto and skanky side of vegas ?
it was the most delicious combination of two ingredients i do n't enjoy .
i know jerk chicken is suppose to be a bit salty but i found everything to be heavily salted .
the steak was prepared perfectly , and the bacon wrap combined with the seasoning made for a very palatable flavor . the loaded baked potato was warm and tender all the way through .
i love this place .
this one had kind of a log cabin feel with a bar when you first walk in .
no one checks on us and their customer service is terrible . they 're so many employees just standing around .
price is very good .
fabulous little cozy place . really enjoyed the americano .
i have to say the inside was amazing ; trendy , clean , really cool light fixtures , interesting decor and open kitchen .
the chairs are kind of weird ... all metal , but that 's to go with the theme i suppose .
the best part was most dish though small , only cost between 3 and 7 dollars each .
it was nice that they had draft beer .
lovely environment as well .
whopper was cold and sloppily made . got sick .
the first experience was fantastic .
beer was really expensive like $ 15 a bottle .
even the margarita was bad .
we ordered a house wine and a draft beer , nothing complicated .
not muddled properly , and it tasted like gin not rum ... .let 's try the nachos ... .hmmm canned guac , canned jalapeño , and add chicken that is cold and cut up from the night before . at least the spotted beer glasses are cold ... .
we waited a good amount of time between refills on drinks , check-in on food quality , and finally the check .
food was acceptable but not overwhelming - especially when you pay strip prices .
the sushi is also pretty expensive , with plates going up to $ 6.50 ( e.g . for three pieces of salmon sashimi ) it 's near the financial district and the decor and furnishings are all very upscale so i can understand the price is going to be higher , but still for me the price is n't really justified .
so for the steaks there were both a little dry for me and lacking flavor .
today i stopped by for a patty melt and a cup of vegetable soup . the patty melt was spot on , and the vegetable soup absolutely delicious .
we ordered a draft beer and glass of wine from the happy hour list , as well as truffle fries ( skip these unless you have a picky eater , very basic ) , calamari ( yum ) , 6 oysters ( still thinking about them ) and 6 cocktail shrimp ( good size , cocktail sauce was great ) .
the restaurant is cute and casual , with the wonderful benefit of a parking lot beside it .
unfortunately we give the food an f. the flatbread tasted like a frozen pizza .
the ugly : it 's worn .
all i know is that i was pleasantly surprised by this place .
the food was delicious , and cooked to perfection
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
such a bummer ! service was less than mediocre .
i paid around $ 12 for my entree and a drink , which is very fair for vegas .
finally , after about another 20 minutes , our food came ( chicken & cairo classic ) , however when my boyfriend asked about the falafel , the waitress admitted she forgot about it and went back to notify the kitchen ... this was disappointing since we wanted to start off with the falafels .
i feel bad for everyone who sat there waiting that long .
also the eggplant w pomegranates was delicious .
been there twice despite the amazing reviews , simply was n't wowed by it . coffee taste burnt and the dishes were just ok. had an egg and steak : steak was tasteless .
its open til 4 am ! late night eating at its finest !
a weak beer selection with the bar running out of the crafts ?
almost forgot about my terrible coronarita ... cheap margarita mix in a normal drinking glass with a corona sticking out .
the floor is n't the greatest , bathrooms ... let 's ignore those .
the interior is bright , clean , and modern , with splashes of hawaiian art , although the space is a bit on the small side .
the portions were fair for the prices and for two of us including a good tip was under $ 25 .
awesome food at a reasonable price .
behind us that looked like it hadnt been cleaned in years and she was searching for silverware to place in front of us .
first time to this restaurant and we were very pleased .
always great food and the most friendliest staff around .
we also tried their hot drinks and i can attest that the mocha , ginger tea , and cider is all delicious .
i loved everything , the meats were tender and juicy and portions were huge , i could n't finish my regular size plate !
they had several beers on tap but not that amazing of a selection of bottled microbrews ( but enough that most people would be happy ) .
still hot , still savory , still delish !
just the worst food we ever had .
great place for quick delicious work lunch or dinner after a long day !
what ever happened to taking care of inexpensive problems that reflect badly on your brand ?
all i can say is delicious ! i 'll definitely be visiting the restaurant !
we did order some margaritas and again they were n't bad just your typical margarita .
typically i feel like servers tend to check up on you within 10 minutes of you receiving your food , but i want to say this time it was a good 25-30 minutes before we had any attention from anyone at our table .
fresh salads and soups . great value and quality food .
generally quite flavorless - and the flavor it did have was not the right one .
service has always been very good , without hovering .
this is the place to go . great view and place .
well done and pls keep it going , i highly recommend !
it 's ambient with soft music , with a classic diner window and it 's adorable !
the only beer they had was budweiser .
beans were `` meh '' and mac and cheese was rather tasteless .
i finally asked if the server forgot about us and she shared that the cooks were overwhelmed and short staffed .
reasonable wine list as well .
the only reason for the 4 stars was because of the `` corny '' attire for the waitresses ... but some guys like the school girl look ( short plaid skirts ) .
loved the decor and concept of this sandwich shop ! staff was friendly and very helpful recommending me some subs .
apparently they only know how to pour beers and make margaritas .
three different servers came out while we were there to say hi to him and not one of them said anything about not allowing dogs .
talk about a depressing background to your meal .
great pizza & terrific appetizers . service is fair
the outdated bathroom that i always felt was dirty is all jazzed up with new tile , sink and fixtures etc .
great atmosphere , friendly staff and excellent food . will need multiple visits to try everything on the menu .
all innovative , tasty and well portioned .
i would pay more for what they offer . i think they went out of business : (
very little lettuce and at least an inch of re-fried beans in the bottom .
randomly came across this place last night , and i was impressed .
she was so helpful and nice , and gave great suggestions !
we waited for what seemed like forever and finally flagged down a different server .
we started with a nice bottle of chianti which was delicious .
was drinking bottle beer so hard to not get that right .
it was reasonably priced and fresh .
the drinks were decent though there were no beers on tap , only in cans . selection was ok though .
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
this is the best place for dirty hairy sloppy tasteless mexican food .
the prices seemed a bit higher than i would expect but not crazy expensive .
i have gone with several different people , some very picky , who have all loved it there -- from the food and the service to the charming paintings on the walls .
in concept the idea seems classy . in practice it 's creepy .
food and drink was great .
great service , fantastic food , good wine selections and pairing .
the lighting was harsh and the whole time i felt like i was in a cafeteria .
excellent , very fresh sushi . the lobster roll is amazing .
decor was very nice .
prices are extremely reasonable and fair .
this company was such a pleasure to work with , the staff was so pleasant and accomidating !
great location , very open-air set up with cute , trendy decor .
also had the brussel sprouts that were spicy and good .
you ca n't beat the lunch special - 3 rolls for $ 13 .
i 've been going here for a while and i 've always enjoyed it .
beers were good ( even though they didnt have any beer specials ) ... hmmmm .
pizza is alway perfect , cavatelli are amazing and the house salad and dressing are a must . have also had catering for large events and again everything was perfect .
food is okay but it 's on the strip and cheap .
i thought the price was fair and one dollar for delivery ?
concerns with the new menu and the increase of cost for meals . i had originally gave the establishment a 1 star , but after speaking with the manager i feel as if that was low .
they have a great selection of wine and other cocktails .
the music and ambience made the experience wonderful .
thought the name meant beer or good drinks . beers were pricey .
there is pink iced tasteless , white iced tasteless ... they have mastered the use of food color ... .
great spot to grab drinks with a good view of the city .
if the management fired you for us walking out , that is just bad practice , patrons walk out of establishments for far less than what we walked out for ( this shows that the attitudes have n't changed from the show ) ) .
i had a pulled pork sandwhich that was bland , dry , and not particularly well put together . my girlfriend had a similarly bland meal .
love this location & the friendly team . every nekter has great products but to be greeted with a big hello & a bright smile is always a super nice plus .
the shredded beef was so dry and overcooked that i only ate half my taco and was over it .
they go beyond to make sure you have a great experience . come and enjoy you will agree .
very cheap lunch and so worth it .
so good ! they even have cocktails with kool-aid !
everything was incredible ( like lick the plate kind of good ) .
thankfully the head of roast garlic which was served with the steak allowed me to add some flavor , but what a total disappointment .
the lobby is nice & the rooms are pretty nice .
you wo n't be disappointed .
we had such a fun time and enjoyed it all - especially the surf and turf roll ! i also loved the tahoe roll .
i love my ipa 's for nfl sunday , mix drinks are a little sweet and a light pour .
amazing service from the greeting at the door to the friendly and efficient wait staff .
just had my best spinach salad ever at fast fresh foods ! a boat load of spinach , lots of great toppings , and a delicious dressing ... all for a very reasonable price !
there was a security guard posted downstairs that people had to show their room cards to gain access to the room elevators which i thought was nice .
it was clean and very bright inside .
never had as bad experience as tonight . they comp 'd the meal but since this is my first yelp post ... that tells you how bad this experience was tonight .
unfortunately we found it quite disappointing . the carbonara was slightly bland and the duck still had a lot of fat on it which should 've been rendered longer .
great menu ! unique fusion combo .
pretty cool dive bar . they 've got pool tables , shuffle board , darts , and live bands .
a gross hole-in-the-wall that was bad as its tacky ambience and ugly surroundings .
for the price it is a pretty good deal .
i had the bahn-mi - very delicious , served with some of the best fries i 've ever had .
there was only 3 pieces , too .
the only 2 beers available was budlight and `` house special beer '' which tasted like piss water .
there was no sauce . tried using the gyoza sauce and hot sauce on the table but nothing worked .
considering one person put the room key card into one of the wallets that was stolen , the only explanation is that someone entered the room while they were asleep and took it things .
pretty ok selection of beer bottles and draught which is what i was after .
the free wine & beer was a plus and the desserts were phenomenal !
oh , yeah , the their bar is pretty stellar ( try the raspberry cider ) .
soups are fresh and fantastic as you 'd expect from a good thai restaurant .
plus the price , all this goodness for less than seven dollars is that possible ?
the sangria wine also was very good .
for the price , you should expect decent quality food .
a little more oily and just not right .
for a family of 3 to dine for under $ 50 was great !
i love to see a group of hard working , polite young people - just awesome !
if you choose bistro 19 know that it is higher end dining and therefore the prices will be high .
not necessarily unclean , but dated , well-worn decor and furnishings give it a bit of an icky vibe .
what i did n't like is that it still took them forever to bring the bill , even after they knew we were in a rush , and when she finally brought the bill , the server said to me , `` just so you know , that was n't my fault , i know you 're mad at me , but it 's not my fault . ''
ingo 's has a pretty decent beverage list that includes a variety of local beers , wine , teas and a yummy homemade lemonade .
prices for drinks are very reasonable and wine choices are good .
restaurant was dirty and there was no soap in the men 's bathroom .
first off , we must have sat there at least 10 minutes before anyone came over to wait on us , which was funny because the girl who waited on us sure found time to sit and chit chat with her co-workers instead of waiting on the clientele .
their beijing chicken had a very odd looking food coloring additive and a very bland taste .
the tator tots where very delicious , flavorful - nothing i 've ever had before .
the prices are a little higher than normal but the food is of a higher quality .
the meat seemed like it was a very good quality and cut .
outdoor malls like this are very popular in florida and california .
i did n't order a drink because they only had cuervo as far as tequila at the outside bar . the food was ok not great but just fine .
3 sapporo 's and all for only $ 50 .
food was ok. nothing special .
the beer was cold and in a pint glass .
he steered me straight to the cubano which was delightful with the fresh grilled pineapple and the generous portions of pork and ham .
burnt does n't taste good .
food was excellent . the music choice inside was a little absurd however .
the servers were really nice and provided quick service .
after we ordered we had to wait 65 minutes to get the food and half of the meals were cold . then i got my bill and was overcharged $ 6 for my bottle of wine .
great atmosphere , consistently great food , and live music on the weekends .
you wo n't be disappointed .
$ 13 for their tuna sandwich is outrageous -- and beyond a price point that i am willing to pay under any circumstances . at 9 or even 10 i thought it was reasonably fair and allowed for a tip -- at $ 13 it is not affordable and there is nothing left over for a tip .
the place itself is pretty small with not a lot of seating .
i did n't think anything of it but when the food was delivered it was kids chicken sliders not chicken strips .
this is a great spot for happy hour drinks .
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
we loved the pasta , entree and special options .
the fish was super fresh and the dressing was bang on .
not many beers on tap , but what they had were pretty good .
after waiting for at least 20 minutes for a server to come around with water and to take our order i finally flagged down a member of staff to let them know we had not been helped . after about 5 minutes , a server came to take our drink and food order .
the price is higher than what i 'd normally expect to pay at a food court .
prices are fair and the staff is nice .
the bathroom was nice , but the advertisements in the mirror were tacky .
it was pretty bland .
great place for lunch . reasonably priced .
needless to say , i am so happy to have found this hidden gem .
got the red wine sangria - very good and strong .
server carmella was horrible , she could not keep up with our requests .
house salad is extremely salty , teriyaki chicken is dry , and the sushi does n't `` wow '' me .
and specially loved the drinks .
great food , great drink selection .
the only thing soaking up the sound is people 's clothes .
the broccoli was not overcooked ; it had a crunch that made me happy .
delicious food , decently priced , and great service .
amazing food and great service . we sat at the bar and the bartender was super helpful with recommendations .
had the buffet about a week ago , we thought it was awful , food was way to spicy .
it was decorated in a really cheesy asian theme , replete with a creepy floating baby head that gave me the willies because its eyes were following me .
beer choices were weak , wine choices were fine .
we ordered some garlic seitan wings which were a little too crunchy but still phenomenally delicious along with an extra large pizza pie with mushrooms and vegetarian sausage . the pizza was out of this world .
good selection of beer , wine ... not at all .
lunch pricing was also too high .
the hibachi was pretty bland . i expected more vegetables , i received mostly rice and meat .
the ordering process is a bit annoying when you get asked 3 times what you ordered .
on a scale of 1-10 , i would give them a 7 , our group had chicken tacos , and a steak burrito , all was fresh and homemade , and the salsa bar is a nice touch for different kinds of sauce .
it actually seems like a pretty cool place to hang out .
i love that you can get 1/2 sandwich with soup , salad or wait mac & cheese !
how many times do you need to hear the f word while eating dinner . it 's unnecessary and extremely unprofessional .
its about high time people realizes that .
the music is loud , so i always find myself talking loudly just to have a conversation .
nice location , plenty of parking on the side streets .
if you 're looking for delicious food though , please make a stop here . lunch is the perfect time to go .
one of the best pizzas i 've had . i got their fried zucchini too and it was amazing .
i ordered the french toast and was absolutely blown away ! it was a combination of perfect bread and very tasty cinnamon batter .
after dinner we thought we were being kind to move to the bar so our server could seat someone else at her table .
the happy hour is spot on with both food and drink specials from 3-7pm .
the restaurant was so dark that multiple people had to use their iphone flash lights to read the menu which is not only annoying , but also distracting when you are getting blinded by another persons flashlight .
love that the parking deck is so close to everything and epicenter is walking distance .
we ordered a pitcher of the house margarita , which was delicious , along with a couple of appetizers .
the fried chicken on the other hand did not and was not as crispy as we would of liked it to be .
service was polite n attentive .
it 's the looks and the snobby tones it 's almost as if i 'm annoying them .
the one thing i missed in the beer list was an indication of how many ounces they pour for the different beers .
the duck was my favorite of all our dishes .
attentive staff once seated .
it was just disappointing .
the bartender warned me that it was not a weak drink .
we go the spaghetti & chicken parmesan , roasted potatoes , and a house salad .
good for date night and girls night to just enjoy the food since they open late till 12pm or 2am .
the food is unexceptional , but reasonable prices for happy hour .
it 's me and my moms favorite place to catch up .
i had a bite of a macaron , and even though they were small , i was unable to finish it as it was too sweet and dense .
the prices are great also .
regular slices are delicious .
decent selection at a good price !
the crepes were of a perfect texture and beautifully presented .
i would definitely going for a date dinner , prices are a tad high but you get what you pay for .
amazing tacos ! great price too , $ 5 each which is a steal for such great quality food .
they claim on groupon that the normal price for two is $ 90+ and that you 're saving about 50 % buying a groupon for $ 42 .
another is off of hwy 51 with meager portions and high prices .
they were average , and i felt a bit disappointed there was n't more crab meat on my burger .
i would have thought the waiter would have picked up on our lack of interest in our food with completely full bowls but obviously no s**t 's were given .
they serve it with a lame dry biscuit and a piece of watermelon & strawberry .
i love their pad thai with chicken and shrimp .
tables are expensive , blackjack was $ 25 to $ 50 per hand depending on when you went to play .
we discovered sawa pretty randomly ( because it 's near target lol ) , and my girlfriend 's coworkers were eating there !
if you have not visited this new addition to the downtown gastonia nightlife , you are missing some wonderful food .
could eat their chicken kebab pita sandwich all the time .
the prices are also very reasonable for the quality of food .
wait staff on their phones in plain sight behind the bar , one waitress was wearing practically nothing , half her chest was showing which was really disturbing .
last but not the least , impeccable service from the staff makes the dining experience unforgettable everytime .
highly recommended . bring your $ $ $ though , the experience is pricey .
the prices are fair .
any time a server delivers your margarita with , `` i 'm a terrible bartender because i like drinking too much .
the staff treat you like royalty and the food is excellent . if you want a delicious affordable meal off the strip , mr. mamas is the place to go !
street corn is amazingly tasty and comes on or off the cob .
bad service , expensive food that 's average at most .
the staff is excellent greeting you with a smile and quickly seating you .
the decor was straight out of sex and the city and , needless to say , outdated and tacky .
this a cool experience .
3 ) food : lunch specials are decently priced ( around $ 10 ) .
hardly any flavour at all .
it 's a nice snack to have while on a study break .
the restaurant is cool and the food is pretty solid too . reasonably priced too .
personally , i enjoyed their salad selections including faro and squash salad , pretty tasty and a nice alternative to the usual green salad .
they appear to have a pretty big list of beer , but i do n't drink beer !
first time to original breakfast house .
the beer i got ( which was the cheapest on tap besides miller lite ) was not bad .
restaurant is on the smaller side , but it 's cozy .
we had about 8 people and we got in after 45 minutes ( not bad ) .
the calimari was perfect -- crunchy and crisp and not at all greasy .
beer selection was horrible ( typical of canada ) and on top of that they were out of the one beer that 's barely drinkable . wine selection was nearly as bad .
the outdoor patio was cool but the tables were way too small !
lori and her crew are always super attentive and the sushi is the best in town . thanks for always making tom 's salsa for me whenever i come in .
the entree unfortunately was disappointing , the fish itself was cooked perfectly , but everything it came with it was frankly bland and devoid of flavor .
the area where it is located and the building itself seem very new .
decided to come here instead of bacchanal . bf and i would n't mind paying over $ 100 for both of us , but the wait time is ridiculous so we decided to come to rio .
my friends and i had a blast exploring the crazy mirrored hallways upstairs and `` glass floor '' in the elevator shaft .
the interior and the space is a clean minimalist style but still comfortable .
five for ambiance -- great building with a modern rustic feel .
totally indifferent food . way too sweet and mostly little flavor .
when i say drinks i mean sodas - no special bar drink or something .
it was extremely chewy .
for a lunch costing $ 40 for two pizzas , unfortunately , food quality and service did n't match up .
quick , friendly staff and the food is amazing !
music was a bit loud but we were the oldest people there .
great tea and drink selections as well .
it was a sweet coconut drink that was really refreshing .
beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor . or at least the menu was .
everyone is very friendly .
the burgers were amazing and have great fries . offered a gluten free bun that was the best i 've ever had ! i had the green chili pepper burger , and would highly recommend you try it .
tool 10 minutes to take my order and 30 minutes after getting up to in quite where my food is service is terrible and the place is n't busy .
great food in a comfortable setting .
they were out of corona so i had a beer on tap sorry do not remember name but it was good .
the prices are reasonable .
it came up to a whopping 16 bucks but panera is not a cheap chain .
the patty itself was ok. a little bit on the dry side but nothing bad at all .
ingredients were fresh and presentation was nice . staff , from the hostess to the waiters very pleasant and helpful .
you can spend $ 50 easy for lunch on a couple of nigiri .
bottom line the atmosphere is amazing , the mural , the wood , the feel - the patio stellar .
i was disappointed they did n't offer any beer on draft .
pretty good value for $ and tasty food .
reasonably priced ( for vegas ) and high quality .
but honestly , with how careless they seem about the order we had what could they of done ?
be careful hostess said 44 minutes and we left at 1hour 45 minutes with no estimate on when we may be seated . we are dedicated customers but we had children us i am not impressed with new location .
order it as it sits for $ 7 , or $ 11 if you 're chicken and have to ask what it is .
i highly recommend to give it a try .
the decor fits warmly with the ethos of graze rather well .
great prices as well .
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
the staff are friendly and nice . the ambience is quiet and they always have great music on .
so disappointed because the sushi chefs and good are always wonderful .
the cocktails were consistent and tasty . the vibe great , beautiful patio , good music and the food oh mah gawd !
the layout of the restaurant is great , though the acoustics make it very loud .
the portions are really generous for what you pay and yet at only $ 2.50 a plate the quality does n't seem to suffer whatsoever .
all of great quality .
they run out of prime rib , bad service , no apologies from manager , one time we wee overcharged for the number of drinks we ordered . thank god it did n't turn into a nightmare to get that off our bill .
the outdoor seating is so lovely- it is as if you are relaxing in a beautiful garden .
the food here is wonderful , and the patio is just lovely to sit at when it is nice outside .
good prices . good service .
skip it . good sauce .
favorites were the tartare , pork belly and the steak , but all delicious .
the other employees were just being difficult .
i got a glass of some other kind of beer in a nasty glass .
the margarita had hardly any alcohol in it , though .
the place was very clean and has lots of space .
the menu looked good , we thought the beer selection was good , especially having 12 draft beers .
enjoyed two cocktails one with some ginger syrup , great .
does this hotel always look dirty , run-down and dark ?
prices are very cheap .
she should have been nice since three slices was 12 bucks not including the $ 3 tip i gave them .
wow this little gem is great ! a friend and i are from strongsville and saw crown of india as a great place to stop .
drinks amazing . they do have drink specials .
the only thing that was n't really good was the wedding soup that my husband got . it was all spinach , few meatballs , no pasta , and really bland .
this was a huge disappointment .
only four beers on tap , none of which were particularly good .
the restaurant was so cool and had a great view ( we were overlooking the gardens where they grow their produce ) . the service and food was amazing .
nice and thick ramen with tasty flavor and lots of veggies , shio and miso are to die for !
i called , spoke to a manager who had a sincere apology and even asked if i 'd like a comped meal for 2 and i said sure since the place was so far away from my house anyways .
you could see behind the wallpaper .
honestly some of the worst food i 've ever had .
a nice light starter with a hint of mint that added very well to the dish .
very friendly service and seems like a fairly clean place .
the sandwiches are the perfect size for lunch .
4. the entire place was out of all draft beer except some shitty orange something .
the 2 bottled beers were quite good though .
what bar does n't have coors light ? did not have it in bottle or draft .
this place was good but definitely not worth the $ 10 for a mediocre burger .
i ended up ordering a cheeseburger with onions , ketchup , tomato , and lettuce . i expected a pretty basic bland burger but what i got was an absolutely delicious , scrumptious , and juicy piece of meat between 2 patties that left me kind of sad i did n't get a second for the next day !
they have great lunch special prices .
i was not sure what to expect .
negative points for weird service and an even stranger ambiance in an old 50 's diner .
best dining experience i 've had in years . the cuisine , the ambiance , the staff such as michelle and amanda were exceptional .
normal portions of good food .
the food was very reasonably priced .
they have a full bar with decent selection of beers on tap , by the bottle and wine .
the food was delicious and reasonably priced .
tables are comfortable as is the seating and atmosphere .
very disappointed . food was cold and bland .
our server joy is the best , great customer service , very attentive and great personality .
the actual restaurant was creepy .
delicious food available here , and the options are good .
this venue is in a small corner behind the car repair shop .
perfect spot to bring out of town guests .
the kicker was when the bill was dropped off i noticed it seemed high .
he was very friendly and helpful .
nothing exciting but cheap , fast , and good . it is fills you quite well .
for starters 3 of our tacos had far less than what anybody would call the proper amount of chicken , and the shells taste awfully close to being stale .
the decor is tired and worn but who cares ?
god , it 's so shockingly ugly inside here .
the leftovers were equally as good .
it had got a bit of everything , and nothing is awful . but nothing is amazing either .
cook everything fresh everyday .
the drinks were n't `` weak '' !
the pastas are not that great and are definitely a rip off if you are paying full price for them .
the rum punch was great and the servers were kind .
as most reviewers below , the only reason we got in is because we had girls in our party .
nothing fancy , service is good ! very reasonable prices .
located in a trendy location in mission .
good service , good food , reasonable prices too .
the seating is rather cozy , but bursting with light , and the service is always impeccable here .
the only negative i have is that he tables in the middle have poor lighting . they should have a light overhead just like the tables aligned against the wall .
the atmosphere was casual and relaxing and the food was superb !
this place has a warm , welcoming feel the instant you walk through the doors .
high prices and food is n't delicious .
interior designer should be shot though - eclectic design that 's incredibly confused and close to distasteful .
prices are very reasonable .
and the selection of wine was awesome .
but the room 's horrible . i ended up in the basement -- six tables , dark , depressing .
i work in the complex across the street and rarely take a break for lunch .
drinks are delicious . i always leave happy .
little diner with nice staff inside the casino .
the staff and people who work here or very friendly and a pleasure to deal with .
the service was weird and the decor confusing .
today we came in and were turned down service and told that both of our washington state ids are fake .
i only ate half the meal before i was too disgusted to continue .
the margarita was weak but ok and there is no way to screw up a cold corona !
metro diner does n't seem special enough to justify the higher costs .
everyone in there had a great view of the game .
and i was glad i did !
my friends and i loved everything we had , and be warned - the cocktails are potent !
i want to love this place especially since our friends all rave about it but every time we decide to give it a go , we are disappointed .
hallway leading to washrooms have some quirky notes , read them for laugh .
- i get that high end burger joints are getting pricier and pricier to account for quality of food costs ... but come on .
the list was not very creative and most bottles i recognized had a 3x markup .
the atmosphere is great too . also price is very fair .
the roll was stale and it did not taste as good as it sounded .
the food is excellent ! my favorite is the thai chicken bowl , and their plantains are drool worthy .
there is a lot of seating space . very clean .
certain pieces of one of my rolls were squishy and hard to break apart with my teeth .
bottom line : yummy food and juice , but extremely overpriced and the staff could learn a thing or two about attitude .
it 's not high end , but it 's great for what you pay for .
the place is nice to chill at as well since they have games like connect the dots and jenga to play while waiting or just killing time with friends .
my thai bbq came like it was fried then it was placed on the grill for a little while , then they added some bbq sauce , reminds me of cafeteria chicken , just worse .
the food is amazing and there 's plenty of gaming for the gamblers but darts and pool tables too !
for drinks we ordered a beer flight and a passion fruit mojito i loved the pineapple cider on the flight .
love the variety of options and freshness of all the brunch foods !
we ordered the takoyaki and the black ramen . i was so disappointed when our food came and the ramen was salty and bland .
good food , pleasant staff .
the filet was good , not the best ever , but very good .
we were able to see the city during the day , and while the sun set .
disappointing draft list . with a name like pints on penn i expected a great beer choice ... of the 5 or 6 selections offered only 2 were available , bottle selection was lacking , not even local brewery selections .
inside is very bland and boring , i guess you could say it looks generic .
very good and reasonable priced for downtown eating .
great atmosphere and nice area .
after 25 minutes of waiting the stupid emo kid gives me a bag .
fries were great as always too , hot and salty .
$ 10 for a slice of cheesecake is absolutely ridiculous .
the server was dismissive and rude .
my orders through door dash are always good as well .
good food , no frills , great price .
pita was plentiful and warm .
the prices are very fair .
atmosphere is clean and bright . nice patio .
disappointed they did n't have liquor but only wine or beer - had to order sangria .
the staff is friendly especially since i go here quite often .
joe is a fantastic server . my water glass was always full , and my margarita was amazing
it was nice how they gave a good chunk of avocado too instead of cutting you short with just a slice or two .
the only reason i give it three stars is cause the manager is a asshole .
the sushi has great flavors and the sashimi was fresh and tasty .
the bar tender did n't know the beers on tap , which were only 8 beers .
the only thing preventing a 5 stat is the dated carpet and furniture .
keep it up fellas , your doing great .
we were visiting from out of town and chris made us feel right at home !
the interior was very dull with pretty much no decor at all .
this was in my top five favorite places to eat on the strip .
the ambiance is good .
not sure how that was possible .
the fries are always delicious and the guy at the window is so nice and authentic when he smiles and greets you .
the amount of food is enough for 2 people when it comes to the plate order which is only $ 10 plus tax .
the price was also reasonable .
then they sat in the air conditioned air on the cold metal plate until the cashier was done with her previous customer .
my second time here , once again an amazing experience . everyone knows the menu and offered a great wine choice .
the total came out to be around $ 12 .
i 'm a college student on a budget and the prices are great for the amount of food you get !
finally one right in my neighborhood .
my favorite is the mushrooms wrapped in pork and the buns .
1 ) prices are extremely reasonable ( $ 8- $ 10 ) for lunch and the portions are great .
i had the osso buco with saffron rice , terrific . my wife had a pizza with gorgonzola that she really liked and my mom had the veal chop with vegetables which she really enjoyed .
try it you will love it .
loved them both . my kind of music .
check in was absolutely terrible . so slow .
customer service is great and very friendly . very clean establishment and they except bitcoin .
to top it off no draft beer in the theater only the bar ?
nothing special . ok for a couple beers .
great serviced prices . employees are friendly and nice .
always an amazing atmosphere filled with a high quality dinning experience that will have you going back for more ! there is never a time where i am disappointed , and i am always treated with the most phenomenal service .
at one point , i could n't even finish my meal because the sauce was so overwhelming , a pity .
nothing cozy or intimate about this space , harsh light and monochromatic ( gray ) color scheme .
the patron perfect margarita was excellent ; great taste , plenty of booze to meet the price point , so i was happy .
i had to wait about fifteen minutes for the hot dog to come out and there was only one other customer in the restaurant .
i love this little casual , unpretentious cafe .
mediocre sushi and food .
do expect a nice hot burger and fries and a fountain soda for about $ 6- $ 8 depending on what you decide to get .
their bloody marys were amazing , not too spicy , and everyone enjoyed their food . they went above and beyond to split up the bottle of champagne we got too .
we started with a sangria that was quite delicious .
first time i 've stayed here and it was amazing !
my dad and i went here thinking it would be a good place to try .
oatmeal was dry ; i had to add a lot of the milk .
it was ok beer was not that great tasting you ca n't even buy a small glass of beer without buying a flight .
i like my tacos simple with just cilantro and onions and all three meats that i tried were amazing . the al pastor has a strong flavor , the chicken and steak are good as well .
why would anyone want to eat a cold burger or chicken sandwich with less than fresh ingredients and a slice of cold cheese on top ? and how about fresh lettuce instead of the old white chunks of iceberg ?
it might sound weird , but check out the bathrooms .
only thing was the seating this time , i felt the lighting was terrible , like i was in an interrogation room .
but majority of the food was totally disappointing .
the iced tea was good .
the whole atmosphere is really cool as well .
they have a pretty good beer list , though nothing on draft .
but the room 's horrible . i ended up in the basement -- six tables , dark , depressing .
if she did , maybe she would have learned how bad the music is .
just flew in and met my coworkers for a quick late lunch .
did not enjoy this place , they over cooked my steak it was tough ! it was supposed to have lobster on it but the lobster was non existent just some weird cream sauce .
the service was terrible .
the juice is expensive $ 9 for 16 oz of juice the food is so-so . why did they get 4.5 stars ?
the inviting atmosphere , paired with great service , makes for a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience .
we had a bottle of wine 2004 merlot from california and it was great with dinner .
the joint is a smallish dinner type place , decorated in a kind of 50 's chicago theme .
i also ate one of the most amazing desserts .
i ordered a glass of wine , they were out of stock , i ordered another glass that was good .
they bragged about how this would be sure to give joe the $ 25 in house prize related to the survey .
so kind and helpful with evrything .
erick and jimmy do a great job and have a long list of songs that you can request - like a live juke box !
we 're paying customers and the fact that the host was very petty and rude as well as the server was extremely disappointing .
after a two hour wait , the food finally came .
good food and reasonable price meal .
drinks and food are at good reasonable prices .
to be fair , the price of the high quality goods is quite high , but there just is n't much reason for me to buy a drink so expensive .
great value and taste . daily specials are amazing and practically feed the whole family .
the food is pretty good , however , the lady who takes your order should be replaced .
we waited a while with our party of 7 but once we were seated we walked by the entire buffet of food , which seemed like it went on forever .
caffe boa is a cute restaurant with a romantically lit patio out front .
the wait staff is generally nice , the wine selection pretty decent for a bistro , however i can never get past the fact they ca n't cook a french fry . location is nice though , the dining room has really cool paintings and good music .
what sent us over the edge was the absolutely terrible service at harry 's bar inside the hotel .
the service not only ruined our dinner , but the rest of our night .
the drinks are strong and they have a good happy hour special .
decent margarita , but in the wrong glass .
i 'm sorry but this place is terrible .
dark , poor lighting and big tables that are uncomfortably .
was thrilled to finally catch up to cousin 's food truck and give them a try .
service was spot on and fast .
the beef was cold and tasteless and the sauce was only mediocre .
when you restrict your hours because you are to afraid of your neighborhood you alienate me and i take my business elsewhere . do n't let racism dictate your business hours because it certainly does n't dictate where i spend my money and so far you have n't received much of it since you are n't open in the evenings like the rest of your entire chain of restaurants .
my mom ordered spaghetti and meatballs which was all water on the bottom of the plate and did not taste good .
the restaurant was also pretty empty customer wise , i can only assume this was due to the price .
my friend ordered a glass of rose and i ordered the rose sangria .
i work near this restaurant and finally went in for a visit .
the drink i ordered was on the weak side .
nothing special , but still tasted great .
i liked the bathroom layout for some odd reason .
thanks darius for your outstanding customer service and hope that you keep that up .
i had dirty silverware and i saw another person ask for a clean glass also while i was there .
love the modern vibe . simple and elegant design .
nice wine selection too .
price is right so that 's good .
here 's my summary of all those great visits throughout the years .
the noodles were by far the saltiest thing i 've eaten .
only thing was i know the lighting is for ambiance and what not but its hard to read the menu with the lights so dim .
it was n't even bottled , pretty sure it was tap .
have always gone to the one in china town and that one is great .
the food was good but we were rushed to pay the bill and vacate the table .
menu is reasonably priced , there are many more expensive places around but this place is a nice middle ground .
perfect place to drop and have amazing grub with family and friends .
they seem to use a lot of fish sauce as i can notice it but it was delicious .
love this place ! the sushi chefs are super friendly and make incredible , fresh rolls .
they have a full bar but i was more impressed with the 20 or so craft beers on tap .
my order was so beyond messed up i ended up being late for work while the manager told me `` that 's not our logo '' when i walked her through the link .
they have a nice wine list as well .
the wine list was decent by the glass and amazing for higher end wines .
when i called to order , the man taking the call even informed me that my order qualified for a free liter of soda because of a special they were running .
even one of the draft beers was bad !
there were dead bugs in the bathroom light , tiling in the shower falling apart , sprinkler a over the bathroom mirror had no cover , you could see up into the ceiling .
their fresh handmade noodles in their beef broth is so delicious .
very dirty ... they dont even clean the rooms . the walls had nasty stuff all over them along with the bathroom floor .
ridiculously massive portions , expensive , slow service , dirty , ugly environment with fluorescent lighting , and the food just was n't that good .
beau had the thai noodle steak salad and it remains a favorite .
sometimes customers complain because they just want to bring a problem to your attention so you can address it , not because they want free dinner .
before anything else , you notice the decor , lacking in bright pink , tacky gold plastic and neon lights i have grown to look for in a good pho place .
that said , i do n't think what they are doing is bad , just not as good as it probably could be .
i waited 20 minutes for someone to finally give me the tickets that i received which were absolutely horrible .
had we not been running late as is , i would have asked them to remake both .
the chicken is so juicy , the fries are seasoned to perfection .
for paying over $ 10 , i expect to get a good amount of food .
there were only 3 other people there .
unless you have a party of 5+ or are ordering a $ 40+ bottle of wine you are n't going to feel very welcome .
he chose their fresh jalapeño cheddar bread ... so good .
i hear lunch prices are more reasonable .
the most annoying part of our experience was the lighting .
the best cajun seafood i 've had so far .
it was a well rounded glass of bubbly . it was light and refreshing with a hint of sweetness at the end , but was definitely not a sweet champagne .
every time we come here we are very happy with the food and service .
i was disappointed they did n't offer any beer on draft .
as a note , the prices are very reasonable too .
service was ok. food is good but my husband said chicken was dry .
it tasted rather good with the nice sauce . the lobster itself was good but it came with some kind of stuffing which i did n't like it all .
woody was very rude and made it clear that he was not working that night and not to bother him .
the staff goes out of their way to make sure their customers are happy . will be coming back for sure !
their fruit was ( surprisingly for me ) the biggest highlight , as everything just tasted good , and was n't mushy like some fruit selections can be .
we only had appetizers but entrees look good.. not a lot of beers on tap but the ones they had were craft beers and were decent choices .
all employees were extremely professional and courteous , the chef was superb .
not only that , it was sliced into huge chunks that it felt like chewing into raw meat .
beer and wine yes , hard booze no .
so awesome ! and jennifer is a super cool waitress .
everything was incredibly excellent , except the almost $ 200 bill but hey i guess you get what u pay for !
one of my favorite places to dine or have a drink .
the customer service here is wonderful for a fast food place .
the vegetables were amazing as well as the chips and salsa .
house wine very good .
all that food and a pot of coffee cost only $ 12 .
it 's so awkward and uncomfortable and all conversation is obliterated by the sound .
you will pretty not walk out of here spending less than $ 15 a person .
the pork filet is grilled to perfection and full of flavor .
ambiance kind of sucks .
excellent food ! i love this place and i will be returning !
it was deliciously sweet with a little bit of crunch and it was surprising with the brie .
very good quality for a great price !
the service was deplorable .
also the bathroom stinks and is kinda dirty .
the noda area is a great place for a night out . live music , great food and fun people .
sadly they did n't offer any hard cider , but a friend was happy with the beer on tap .
everything is great about this place except the cost ... average $ 22.00 for a large pizza or a 12 '' gluten free pizza .
decor is causal industrial and cozy .
service was good considering she seemed to be the only server .
i do n't care if they are tiny and cost $ 5 and represent a terrible value . i had three !
they have a good beer selection but unfortunately the beers we ordered were flat .
the restaurant is pretty hipstery and cool . i like the feel .
pay over $ 100 for a meal that leaves you wanting more different food because this was lot good !
wings were great ... they were a bit on the greasy side but crispy and spicy ! had large supreme pizza and it was great as well .
so - decent breakfast very reasonably priced with good service .
when all 11 of us agreed we had a bad experience , i know they restaurant did something wrong .
one of the more beautiful lobby 's in town as well .
the inside was nice and basic tables and chairs , a older phoenix home converted to a restaurant a nice cozy place .
the chicken was dry and covered in spices so thick that it covered my whole mouth .
wow ! service by our waitress , katy , was friendly , helpful and very professional .
the service was fast and friendly .
makes my day every time i stop in . keep up the great work , all businesses at the west side market should be this great !
the price was reasonable .
i reccomend sitting at the bar , the set up is really interesting and although there 's alot of people working in such a small restaurant it feels like an intimate family oriented restaurant it 's really nice .
the pizza sauce is also very sweet .
the service was attentive , friendly and informative .
although i only had wine , the craft cocktails look amazing !
but the price is insane because there is better .
the service we encountered was nice and friendly and seemed to be hitting on all cylinders .
the restaurant attempts to be very trendy with it 's dim lighting and decor , but it 's more annoying than anything .
oh my gosh , it was perfect .
the ambiance and the environment with surrounding cases included celebrity memorabilia , and a nice dark brown bar area .
then , the noodle texture tasted like an instant noodles you can get at the dollar store .
i would say a fair price for the tiny bite is 50 cents .
the fire roasted veggies and smashed potatoes were delicious .
oh and they make great drinks too .
would come often , but expensive though : ( $ 15 lb .
i would probably order the same without the mushrooms , as i suspect that those are the key culprit in the rapid deterioration of my bun ( other than the burger juices and the runny egg yolk , neither of which i 'm willing to eschew ) .
also , the bathroom was disgusting , with the urinal having a leak that was `` fixed '' with paper towels .
cold and it just tasted like bread .
lighting in the rooms were terrible - ladies , good luck applying makeup - men , best of luck shaving !
we moved to the neighborhood and salty sow is my new guilty pleasure .
price is very reasonable .
our favorite restaurant around .
also , a few of my pieces of chicken were undercooked .
the draft beer selection was lacking but the bottle service was awesome .
it still ended up being 12 $ for two people after drinks and honestly cicis , call it what it is : a six dollar buffet or 5.99 not 5 and change .
my favorite place for sushi .
they have lunch specials that are super cheap ( $ 5-8 ) but other times are also cheap .
it 's been a hard time finding a place comparable .
we are the only table she is serving !
it 's filled with a bunch of modern lighting and furniture , if you 're into that sort of thing .
the prices are also very reasonable .
high street is a happening spot .
great drink menu , good selection .
my husband ordered the `` big cheesy '' and it was cooked perfectly , but the flavor was just average . i ordered the `` cinco '' and while it was prepared well , i did n't like the taste .
the decor of the hotel is simply beautiful as well .
the food was fresh and hot .
great look and feel inside .
the decor was really nice with the lights and the space is bigger than khao san road .
i went with the fresh berry lemonade and was very happy with it .
nice clean atmosphere , and a nice patio to sit at with misters .
drinks were a little weak but draft beers worked well enough .
the toast was n't too great , but the crab salad was delicious .
kind of creepy actually .
the service was great and loved the atmosphere on the rooftop .
we always enjoy the food from panda express , our problem lies with the poor staff it seems like they are poorly trained and not up to speed on how to handle customer service .
yeah , we fell for it , the beef was blech but that 's what you get for the price . the quesadillas were n't bad though .
had the spicy fried rice for lunch today . the food was excellent and the service was great .
other sides of rice and beans were great and the dipping sauces were also really good .
i ca n't believe i only pay $ 5 for a burger meal .
the cooks were ok today , the house salad was lacking , only two cucumbers instead of the normal other then that is was only carrots , tomatoes and lettuce .
there was only a small section of beautiful views due to big buildings blocking .
the noodles had a nice chewiness to them , which you could tell resulted from the dough being hand-pulled rather than store-bought . the broth also was n't excessively oily , so i did n't have to hold back from slurping up the soup while eating .
the prices are fair .
part of the restaurant is an outdoor patio , which is great when it 's nice out .
the chicken and beef dishes were served on huge platters fit for a queen !
drinks were a little weak but draft beers worked well enough .
i will probably give them another chance , but the service was disappointing .
the taste is a pretty good . the price is over priced .
we ordered five dishes which came up to a total of $ 54 , including the cost of tea $ 7 .
was here with my wife and daughters to celebrate a late valentine 's day since we both had to work and today was our day off together .
this is a great little spot to visit .
the good beer was n't on special at all , and their `` domestic '' beers were all pretty much the crap i wo n't drink .
also , the shrimp were cut up into smaller pieces , so i had 3 whole shrimp at max on my sandwich . it was ridiculous .
the soup however , was bland .
so chewy : ) we ordered way too many noodles .
food was ok. not worth the $ $ and service was bad not impressed for being a high end restaurant .
first time , we both had a stromboli , nicely browned with lots of stuff inside .
the rice was very bland .
take a cheese pizza that looks like it was frozen at one point , throw cold arugula and cold chunks of prosciutto , then charge $ 14 for it . lazy attempt and not worth it ... .
we loved this restaurant .
give the ginger chicken a try ( packs a punch of heat and complex flavor ) , bhaji kashmiri and and any of the curries .
price a little high for the quality of the food .
a good experience except for the old couches which were a bit uncomfortable . looks like a great gathering place for the locals !
there was also a good selection on tap , but there were no descriptions of the beers on tap , nor were there any prices for beer indicated on the menu .
it was loud and sort of clubby , but that 's part of the experience .
we were sat and the server came over to get our drink order , which was probably the only good thing of the night .
this is a great place to meet up with friends and have a good inexpensive time .
she also said that if there was anything that is n't on the menu and if she knows of the recipe , she would be glad to prepare it , all you need to do is call .
what a cool spot !
surprised that there were a few true craft beers ( in bottles , no taps ) .
great atmosphere . always lots of fun , and great great music videos , when they are n't playing the censored crap .
tried the general tao chicken , amazing , it 's easy to tell that they use good quality meat , the sauce is carmelized to perfection and they add jalapeños instead of bell peppers for added kick . the pan fried dumpling is amazing as well .
i 'm not an expert on interior design or anything like that , but it just did n't feel comfortable in there .
the flavor was n't too sweet like some places .
food was cold and boring . not at all impressed .
at least they have a cool bar and live music .
very nice , modern decor with a pretty long bar . pretty sizable patio as well !
i had the smoked salmon eggs benedict which was very good with plenty of salmon .
but the service is terrible , there are so many people walking around , but you ca n't get their attention .
prices were very reasonable .
great way to start a night and have dinner before you go out .
the girls had skinny margaritas that came in what looked like `` toy '' glasses and had hardly any tequila .
would have given an additional star if he was nice .
not bad for 11 bucks .
it was like they where afraid of salt .
our waiter was attentive and helpful with menu choices , and the food was great !
but the workers provided the worst customer service i 've had in a long time .
this nice restaurant i believe sunk $ 5 million dollars on the property .
i can only assume that this is his normal behavior , as i also saw him shoo a busser away from a table in a very degrading manner as well .
the prices are great too , not too expensive .
it lives up to the hype . come with your phone charged and a good attitude because there is no way around the line .
i started with the apple & quinoa salad , which was delicious !
great place to go have a nice relaxing breakfast or lunch while watching planes .
food is good . it 's reasonably priced .
great happy hour , wine menu , and meals .
it 's a great place to dine out with friends !
the women 's bathroom was clean , just had a weird layout .
drinks are nice but the wine selection was even nicer !
it 's simply a nice little coffee shop .
the sauce is an awesome twist to traditional mac n cheese with a southwest zing , amazing !
reasonable prices as well .
i love how they have the privacy of each table , you get a little booth where you take off your shoes and you get to sit inside .
i tasted it and found that some noodles were nice and soft while , others were a little hard .
this is n't the way to train employees , it just made me feel awkward and bad for him .
good deep dish , little pricey . great service .
the rolls were subpar and their special mango mesquite roll just had some funky flavors going on and i could n't figure out if it was tasty or disgusting which is a first for me .
the place has a sleek modern look , but is still comfortable . i love the booths .
the lunch specials are reasonably priced and decent sized . the atmosphere and staff are both pleasant .
i highly recommend the parillada plate so you can get a little taste of everything .
it 's a great lunch option for $ 10 per person .
it 's nice to sit outside when the weather is nice .
great food , really nice waitstaff , comfortable surroundings .
that 's 18 pieces of sushi for only $ 10 !
it 's a great place to go if you want a new dining experience and are tired of paying $ 25.00 for itty bitty pieces of steak !
the food is good , drinks are very reasonably priced and good ( $ 6.50 martinis ) , and it 's a fun atmosphere .
just lacked a certain flavor for me .
i will never return ! poor service , rude .
the food is pretty good and well priced .
lastly , the happy hour here is great .
they have a fantastic beer and wine menu , which has my favorite wine and my husbands favorite beer .
mind you , these were two draft beers , one bottle , and a glass of wine and there was only one patron sitting at the bar .
and , the place does have some good lunch prices .
the bathroom was kind of dirty and there were n't any paper towels .
i went in and the place is cool inside , an area for large groups towards the back , with the nice booth setup it would be a great date spot especially with the atomic koi right next door .
the prices are very reasonable along with a good selection .
walls are chipped up and needing attention and the lighting is just too bright .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
having heard that toronto has the reputation for great food , i was looking forward to my foodie vacation ! being from nyc my expectations were high .
it 's just awkward .
it 's just awkward .
the original menu was good and food was great , but now they dropped the price by quite a lot ( for example risotto from ~ $ 25 to ~ $ 15 ) .
i hate to leave a negative review on a place that i enjoy but this server was honestly so rude that it 's unacceptable .
stopped by again for another quick , late lunch .
typical vegas prices , it 's not cheap but it 's a nice place with good food and drinks .
they had a good selection of beers and something i 'd never seen before , jameson on tap . i 'm very curious as to how liquor on tap works ( and why a mexican restaurant had whiskey on tap instead of tequila ) but we did n't have the time to stay and investigate .
like for real , it 's almost creepy .
no draft beer there but a nice cold bottle of corona .
my husband had a cornbeef sandwich that i sampled and was very good .
the staff was attentive and helpful .
any manger will tell that coffee should have been comped ... sausage was cold .
serving size is good ! their pinakbet is the best so far .
my boyfriend liked the salmon and the cauliflower was yummy as well .
price are super cheap for the quality of food .
prices were fair , atmosphere was cozy ... music was out of place .
we made a reservation which i highly recommend doing .
my husband and i had an awesome dinner at ticoz ! our server andrew was excellent too !
the prices are reasonable .
they also have a drink called the fishbowl with is a giant fishbowl full of alcohol ! i only fished about half of it !
sucks for pictures , pretty dark .
the salmon had a nice crunchy baked crust on the outside and was tender and juicy on the inside .
even the drinks were great and came in sizable glasses .
if you 're eating in , they start you off with complimentary breadsticks , which is fried pizza dough flavored with garlic and sprinkled with parmesan cheese on top . delicious !
the prices are very good .
almost forgot about my terrible coronarita ... cheap margarita mix in a normal drinking glass with a corona sticking out .
they gave us the wrong dressing , the croutons were soggy , the pizza was tasteless and the wings were swimming in butter . never again .
they ran out of salmon , did n't have any chicken left , the meals did n't come out all at once , the burgers were cold , one of the dishes was not spicy as listed .
i got my food , and it was disappointing .
also , i ordered the sweet shrimp which only came with 1 piece , other sushi places gives 2 pieces and charges less .
i love this place for happy hour . take advantage of their 1/2 price drinks and appetizers , best deal on mill ave. the atmosphere is great , a large patio with long tables and bench seating , plenty of room for a large group .
i do not order tap beer there , the selection is very weak anyway .
the worst thing is the bathrooms , they have run 2 four foot fluorescent lights on each side of the bathroom mirrors that are bright and obnoxious .
only real negative was how dark it was ; jet black walls and ceilings , dim lights , but that was n't a big deal .
drinks are excellent also .
only go for happy hour for drinks any more !
we wanted a nice relaxing night , a good bottle of wine and a steak .
this trendy spot is casual yet i can see the bar getting up and popping later in the evening .
carmon 's is a dingy little restaurant that has cute `` authentic '' touches here and there - fans that look like jet engines , mismatched salt and pepper sets , crappy paper menus shoved onto a clipboard , an antique cash register - but their menu lacks a certain something .
you ca n't see the `` stage '' area unless you are one of the three front tables . find a new way where all the seats can see the karaoke area without having a giant bar in the way .
not bad for the price .
they have a beautiful private room that is amplified by their wonderful menu .
i recently attended a wedding here and it was gorgeous . the ceremony was held near the entrance of the venue and it was on a hill overlooking a beautiful scene .
a nice selection of wines compliment the menu .
they have delicious fajitas and yummy drinks ( both alcoholic & non-alcoholic ) .
the ambiance is perfect for a group setting or a romantic evening .
glad that phils is still a staple in town !
overall , very satisfying , reasonably priced , and quick .
tons of lunch specials , great prices and lunch come w soup or salad and a spring roll .
when he returned , it smelled amazing and tasted better than it smelled .
it was definitely a unique tasty drink but the alcohol was very weak .
the beer drinker in me switched to a delicious rose ' , refreshing .
the price of the food is a very good bargain .
the bartenders also make great recommendations on beers and drinks based on your preferences .
the server was nice , but we sat there just waiting for service for quite a while . the restaurant was pretty empty .
service is very good . bread rolls are fresh .
the food was a joke , ordered carne asada tacos got more like dry lemon drenched meat .
it looked like it went bad and they cooked it anyway . then i tasted it and knew it went bad and they cooked it anyway .
the food is very good and reasonably priced .
i then decided to lighten the mood as she seemed so upset to be wrong and made a joke .
the wine list was also very good .
my husband 's manhattan was delivered to the wrong table and sat there for about 10 minutes .
delicious fresh food and the portions are very large .
came here two years ago and frequented their happy hour , enjoyed the wide cocktail selection . came back and discovered their happy hour has since been reduced to just two cocktails - pear harvest a vodka drink , and from the garden a gin drink .
came here for drinks and the bartender was a gentleman and great conversationalist .
the beer was good and cold , but i think i would rather have a draft house beer .
horrible food , crappy lighting , and the monkey sound effects i can do without ! the flashing lights and animal cries are just plain disturbing to have going off while one is trying to eat and enjoy thier company !
i was greeted quickly and they were very friendly .
there are some restaurants in the mgm grand where dinner for one person can cost over $ 100 . i 'm thankful the mgm also has places in their food court where the prices are more reasonable .
the hawaiian poké bowl was fresh and tasty with loads of flavor . the ramen was also full of flavor and tasted very authentic .
i ended up paying a premium price for mediocre ( at best ) food .
i was disappointed that they have no draft beers .
they had great deals on drinks !
while neither my husband or i drink beer , they look like they have a good selection of bottled and draft beers .
a good portion of these were under an awning but there were others in the sun or shaded by the building and/or trees .
i 'm not fond of the mismatched furniture and the seats are painfully uncomfortable ( unless you get a booth ) .
foul . the blend of textures wasnt very appealing , the sauce was a bit much , but something had to help mask the bland food and disgusting breast meat chicken ( ? )
they have really cheap lunch specials and pretty decent food .
the bartender was friendly and i sampled a couple of different wines from their excellent list .
price is very good , but i would rather pay more for better quality pho .
the ambience is very nice and romantic .
i then switched to beer - they have a pretty good beer list available , too .
the prices are also extremely reasonable .
the drink was really good ; i especially liked the strawberry rock crystals along the rim on the drink .
not sure what 's up with the decor though .
at this point , i 'm getting annoyed waiting for my drink while the customer who is it for ca n't get off his cell phone .
the food comes out fast and hot - and the portion sizes are huge !
i had the full tasting menu and passed on the wine .
i got excited even thou i noticed the scoop of mac salad was on a skimpy side .
our waitress raquel was so sweet and very friendly . the place was very clean and the employees were all very friendly and greeted us with a smile .
6 beers on tap and only one watered down version if a beer , so that 's a plus .
the price is outrageous but worth it for special occasions .
the staff is always friendly and fast !
then she veered off other customers who walked behind us , and offered them patio seating .
they had glasses of wine for 1/2 off and the desserts were just right too .
it 's a good price for some decent food .
the bbq beans are amazing . the tri-tip was also good but damn , those beans !
i was annoyed , unfortunately .
the wine list is amazing and comprehensive .
was extremely nauseous after eating the shrimp and chicken with broccoli with no sauce on it .
i also ordered a thai tea which was a great value at $ 2.50 because they are usually at the $ 4.50 price range . i ordered duck for my meat and it was pretty good especially at its price point .
the drinks were good - mojito and prosecco , i 'd recommend .
you may end up waiting 20 minutes or so for a table ... i suggest getting there at 11:45 or earlier if you want to sit right away .
this is not a cheap restaurant , and the ambiance is n't cheap , either .
the rice i found to be dry and clumpy .
it was okay , not what i expected . the toasted bun was nice , but the flavor from the chipotle chicken was lacking .
after an hour of waiting i finally had everything i wanted , so i looked around to find the cashiers and saw them located at the exit with another line ... being annoyed at all this waiting i was paying for my food and the female cashier was being rude and unprofessional ... all in all the food was meh ... at best .
huh ? bartenders were ok ... though real slow getting me another beer .
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
not that i drink beer but they have huge beer selection , over a 130 beers on tap .
the restaurant itself was cute and i especially loved the soccer on the tv !
sat out on the patio , and got to experience the unique culture in this part of toronto !
this is a casual place to get beer and wings . the beer prices are not the cheapest but the food is decent .
all the food came out hot & fresh full of flavor .
i would have given 5 stars but over an hour wait with a reservation is ridiculous .
the cheapest attractive entrees were $ 11 and the cheapest red wine was $ 9 ( i bought a good wine for $ 10 . )
i do n't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible .
always a personal touch . great ambiance in the barbie dining room .
service is terrible , waited forever to place the order .
very good food at reasonable prices .
i had wings and the lemon pepper wings were really good , flavorful and tasty .
good atmosphere . nice place .
also try dessert- it 's all good !
the food was good and reasonably priced .
i just love my strawberry and lavender cocktail ( $ 13 ) which was so delicious , i licked every single lavender infused sugar off the rim of my martini glass .
i had a great night here and will be back for sure !
the ugly : it 's worn .
honestly though considering that every thing on the menu is 15+ $ for tiny size really ditch the lame 1 $ surcharge on water .
it really was n't that bright ( bright finish , but immediate taste was dark ) .
this is a true family business and the food is fantastic .
it 's a great location and i love the idea of having a really cool coffee shop close by .
lots of parking space and the restaurant is spacious , clean and well lit .
there is only one who needs to have an attitude adjustment and i 'll leave it at that .
for $ 20 for a bowl of ramen ( absurd , should be $ 10 ) it was very disappointing .
the first bad sign was that the girl who took my order for delivery did n't come across very intelligent .
great little place ! food is good quality at an affordable price .
i love the bite size chicken and the sides are delicious
the menu looked good , we thought the beer selection was good , especially having 12 draft beers .
pretty good , good price .
the wings are nice and flavorful . and the dessert is amazing !
very friendly employees and clean spot .
the worst part was the horrible customer service .
for the price they charged for a `` holiday weekend '' ( $ 45 ) , there was nothing spectacular or special . great service though .
certainly not what you 'd expect from a restaurant priced at $ 35+ per person .
the liquor menu was great -- with a terrific selection on tap .
loved the food portions .
another in our party had the chicken and a doughnut ... the doughnut was good but the chicken was tuff and not seasoned at all ... and it did not come with the sour cream it was supposed to , and the fries were limp .
food is tapas style and is just absolutely delicious .
the atmosphere of the place was excellent and the wait staff were super friendly .
prices here are outrageous for special orders . they charge a whopping $ 4.79 plus tax for a mcdouble made `` like a mac '' -- that burger costs only $ 1.69 made the regular way .
i found the dessert to be on the pricey side for mediocre ice cream .
we both had some sweet potato fries and they were delicious .
service is usually very prompt and nice , looks clean throughout the store .
the drinks were super strong .
poorly made and the ingredients must be cheap or the employees lazy as it seemed they threw everything on some ( undercooked dough ) and slapped it in the oven . very disappointed : (
hardly any cheese at all .
great bartenders and excellent drinks . strong and delicious .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
not bad food for the price .
i had the the sage fried chicken benedict . it was amazing .
busy place , slow service , and bland but tolerable . i think they pay more attention to the decor more than the food .
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
anyway , i took advantage of the happy hour beer specials , but unfortunately i really hated the second beer ( something by deschutes that i think might have been skunked ) .
we stayed for two nights . all things considered it 's a good deal if you get your room for less than $ 60 ... because it 's a great and original place ( if you stay in an pyramids room ) .
price 2/5 - i mean you 're paying $ 10 for bad food ... it 's still bad food .
congrats to a burger place that can do it right !
i got a mint julep that was perfect .
beer and margaritas available , not sure about any other alcohol .
but it want just great food , luis our server ws outstanding - one of the most attentive server we 've had while eating out recently . we 'll be back next week and asking for luis !
very cute place ! a bit on the pricey side for a more cafe setting but still a pretty nice place and unique .
weird that the men 's one person bathroom has a big gap in the door .
tiny dance floor , no seating for dancers , lighting wrong , atmosphere `` created in haste '' , bad , bad , bad .
use to go here 5 years ago when we used to live close by . yesterday we drove there , to see if they still as good as i remembered .
cold and refreshing with just a hint of sweetness which makes it the perfect beverage to go with the chef inspired sliders .
dim lighting makes it incredibly difficult to read , and i 'm not old !
very good wine as well .
the furniture here was outdated and not to fit the theme , but just nothing aesthetically pleasing .
no margaritas . just beer and wine : -/ what 's a girl to do .
always find the staff very friendly and unpretentious .
the smell of the burger was nauseating and the meat was bland .
what 's different is this is one of the two strip starbucks that does n't drastically inflate their prices to pay for high strip rents .
no cheap statues or posters hanging on the wall that are supposed to give you the hint you 're in another world .
the bathroom was nice , but the advertisements in the mirror were tacky .
everything on the plate was wonderfully cooked and the flavours were nice .
and of course , they have a giant jukebox right in the middle of the restaurant from which you can choose a variety of songs .
however , for 2 people at lunch , $ 8 was perfect !
they have a pretty good beer list , though nothing on draft .
good drinks . love the strawberry margarita .
a much different atmosphere for lunch , bright , not too noisy and a long community table making it easy to converse .
the ice cream was surrounding the cake and it tasted awful .
i absolutely love the concept . the quality of the ingredients is great .
great wine and food selections .
it was horrible . meat had an awful taste .
notice how virtually none of the `` bad '' ratings came from people who have actually been to this kind of restaurant before .
the men 's rest room was dirty .
one of our very favorite stops when in cave creek ! we always look forward to enjoying the outdoor space with dog friendly dining , service and venue is dependable !
bad food , taste spoil .
especially love the szechwan spicy beef and the crab puffs !
food was not good we were served frozen fries and burnt burger with undercooked meat and slow service . gave two stars because it was cute inside and waiter was very nice .
all of their food is amazingly priced , but the low prices do n't mean low quality .
i had the tonkotsu and it was pretty good , but i was n't a big fan of whatever slabs of meat they put in there .
quite a good combination .
very reasonable prices and tasty food .
a great welcoming , relaxing atmosphere .
trio 's caesar salad featured powdered parmesan and was pretty flavourless . the house wine was undrinkable , and the quatro formaggi pizza was really bland .
others speak that its expensive , however , you get what you pay for .
together with the dingy furniture and shabby decor , i was seriously worried about food poisoning . the service was pretty bad too .
giving them two stars just coz the interior is sort of cute .
we stopped here for some lunch before an appointment and we really liked it .
low rating because a ) $ 35 for 3 coffees and 3 cronuts is insane , that 's higher than sf and enough a reason to go elsewhere .
the sushi is consistently good , the fish is fresh and the rice has a nice texture . some of the rolls are pretty creative , and my favorite is the cajun albacore .
i love north park and run there quite often .
the bottled selection is good and their rotating drafts are good as well - i do like seeing their iced down bottle display : ) we sat at the bar and i had a chicken pita with pineapple mango salsa and a side salad with balsamic . both were very good , and the bartender was very accommodating and attentive .
housekeeping is sloppy all over the hotel . i would never stay here again .
you 're doing it right crazy mike !
extremely crispy on the verge of being a little overcooked , but it was ok. service was good .
the only 2 beers available was budlight and `` house special beer '' which tasted like piss water .
we asked what was in the margaritas as in what kind of tequila and the bartender responded `` everything is tequila based like every margarita '' .
we had the crab cake and spinach dip appetizer which was very good .
a dollar a wing is not a good price .
when the bill came , the manager , who never came over to the table to either apologize or inform us as to how he was making things right , had deducted a meager 15 % from the check -- a nominal fix for what was for us a huge and unnecessary disappointment .
after rolling by a ton of places lit up with fancy signs and neon lights , pulled up to this restaurant not expecting much . how wrong was i .
i was extremely happy with the crab cakes and shrimp .
on the up side , my margarita was strong so left w a buzz : )
other customers there began to get pushy over food , not sure if they usually run out ?
the only disappointment was the fried bean app - skip it !
the margaritas were so weak i 'm not sure they even had tequila .
the beer i got ( which was the cheapest on tap besides miller lite ) was not bad .
and if you 're not willing to get rid of those lights or turn them off , put in warm bulbs -not cool .
everything on the menu is reasonably priced .
we were also drinking a lot of iced tea & soda and our waiter was amazing .
prices are good as well .
the only real flaw it they should put padding on the ceiling or wall to suck up the loud noise from the plastered customers ..
aesthetically , it was nice but at night , we could hear the music from the club until the wee hours of the morning .
this place is great . the donuts are excellent and the employees are very nice .
if you are looking for reasonably priced sushi with a large menu , but nothing too fancy , this is your place .
worst of all , the buns they use are terrible and flavorless .
they made me a pineapple mojito that was n't on the menu and it was delicious !
i ordered the red beef curry and it was disgusting , absolutely disgusting .
not sure if they are using fluorescent bulbs but the lighting messes with my eyes and gives me a slight headache .
went there for breakfast today , service was terrible .
the interior design is nothing too special , especially considering some of the amazing high design concepts here in las vegas .
the prices are reasonable .
they did n't have any beer on tap , only select few bottles which was disappointing .
fantastic meal , great wine list , but very expensive .
the lighting is probably supposed to be mood lighting , but just made it tough to read the menus .
and even though the hallways scream 1960s , i even liked the low ceilings because i 've never felt so tall .
the layers of flavors and the freshness of all the ingredients were amazing .
i started off with a glass of chardonnay , that was just ok. it was n't a great choice for the only glass of chardonnay offered on their menu , but it was drinkable .
to many bad thing to mention . they should be a shame .
total for three was about $ 52 with no appetizers and no booze , just soft drinks .
they were not cheap ( $ 1 a piece and not particularly large ) , but i believe in spending a bit more for small business 's sake and good quality .
decent prices for delicious food .
it 's kind of depressing .
rating this place 4 stars because the service was a little slow , it took our table 30 mins before we could enter our food order in , but once our food arrived it was amazing !
all of the meats were very tender , all of the sides had great flavor .
excellent service . friendly .
the pizza was delicious .
the hookah is $ 30 , i think that is a little over priced , i usually you only pay about $ 20 .
price is very reasonable .
this place is pretty good . do n't let the chipped paint on the walls make you think otherwise .
the waiters , manager and anyone that spoke to us were very pleasant .
the whole place was really dirty - stains on the walls and the floors were disgusting .
good atmosphere , not overly loud so i was able to chat with my friends ,
the food is excellent and very reasonably priced .
it 's classy but with sparkle ... if that makes sense hehe .
so becareful when the waiter asked what kind of water you want .
we got a nice little corner in front of the fire pit .
very reasonably priced for the great quality .
i have also tried the pot pie ( also delicious ) , and the pork tenderloin which may be the biggest item on the menu .
i love abay , and i 'm happy to see them doing so well in pittsburgh .
i did n't give it five stars because it was really dark and loud , but it 's such a small intimate space and i 'm not sure how they could improve the darkness without making it less `` swanky '' .
as far as night life is concerned , it is a pretty decent place with decently priced drinks .
everything was well cooked , well presented and , most importantly , tasted right .
they have a full bar , a nice draft list , and an array of bottled and canned beers .
i consider myself a foodie , and i 'm here to tell you that original sunrise cafe has the best breakfast .
i always *have* recommended it , and now , after that amazing and unexpected experience , i will always continue to do so .
the surrounding patio is a chill atmosphere to choose to sit at if you 're dining in on a warm sunny day .
nothing awesome , but nothing disappointing . the prices averaged maybe $ 1 per item higher than the many comparable places in shadyside .
on the plus side , prices are very reasonable .
paid $ 15 , and all i could eat was a little chicken and `` fried '' rice .
the music was great & the guy had an amazing voice .
the food is wonderful and happy hour is the deal of the century . homemade lemoncello shots are heavenly !
i even once tried a pretty awesome jalapeno margarita but honestly i would rather drink the beer .
to top it off no draft beer in the theater only the bar ?
prices are fairly reasonable , especially for the quality of the food .
fortunately , there 's competition in chandler at pokitrition , and that 's where you 'll find me .
excellent cocktails though ! definitely a nice spot outside of casinos
i absolutely loved this place !
the prices are reasonable .
i get the fact of the hipster décor and approach to almost anything that involves food nowadays , but old christmas decorations lining the walls it just ridiculous .
i had a little of everything , have to say that most of what i tried was ok. the buffet is nothing special but it did the trick .
surprisingly it 's pretty cheap for quality of food .
the creepy , outdated statues are n't not doing any favors for this place .
it adds a sweet flavor to the food with great texture .
it 's a ridiculous , around a $ 1.50 fee if you do n't spend at least $ 8 before tax .
they have awesome happy hour and yummy champagne . they are also opening a lounge which we ca n't wait for !
we also had margaritas which you could hardly taste anything but a pre-made margarita mix .
unfortunately , they have no beers .
the meat was delicious , smokey and juicy . i also tried the stew which was good !
also the bathroom stinks and is kinda dirty .
atmosphere was cool , had an industrial feel .
i got an iced hibiscus tea that was sweet , refreshing and absolutely flavourful .
it 's a very solid place with a nice atmosphere .
the customer service here is always awesome too .
the stage area was alright , but far from good .
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
the price is n't that expensive .
good but should be $ $ $ $ did n't expect to pay $ 19 for only 4 pieces of nigiri sushi and $ 15 for one piece of toro . plus tax and a tip , $ 40 for 5 small sushi !
i ordered the bbq chicken salad and it was enough to feed a family of four !
that was kind of creepy .
i mean that 's a lot for 10 $ .
good options for vegetarian ( my wife ) .
great salad . i had the borderline , it was well dressed and had excellent flavor .
the drink was super refreshing , big enough for two , and absolutely delicious .
drink menu was amazing .
i ordered the chicken kabob plate which is my usual fare in restaurants with this type of food .
unless you have a thing for weak , tasteless cocktails , i suggest ordering a beer or glass of wine .
service was horrible too .
was a bit loud but the music selection was great .
after finishing my drink , i went for a refill as i normally do when i leave and did n't experience any problems doing so .
i was unable to check in until i finally spoke to a manager .
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
incredible service ! the staff was very friendly and attentive .
the chicken sandwiches were huge with quality toppings .
i had a spring roll ( with chicken and shrimp ) also .
as i 've heard many say before , if your not looking for this place you would easily pass it , and while that is true , i 'm glad i was looking for it !
$ 12 for kids meal : - ( but overall , food is good , but expect for a high bill if you are bringing your whole family .
come here for ambiance : crazy beautiful golf course views , outdoor corn hole , big screen tvs for sports lovers , good live music & wrap-around bar .
it might just be the placement of the furniture , but there 's something that kind of feels ... awkward .
when ordering the guy taking our order acted as if he did n't know the menu or ingredients like is the fanta caffeine free .
the food was great but it took about an hour just for our appetizer to arrive and about 30 minutes after that for the food to come out .
the draft beer selection was lacking but the bottle service was awesome .
setting and decor is beautiful , modern , and classy .
i though their food was bland for mexican and rather uninspired .
all the curtains were down too which made it unnecessarily dark . mediocre .
it was just bland meat in a bun .
the beer selection was decent for canned beers but the only had one brand on tap and the one i wanted was out .
oh well , now i just get the wings and a salad . the turkey melt is awesome as well .
even the margarita was bad .
i really liked this place and it was really good except for my one rib that for some reason tasted like it was cooked on or near a piece of fish .
to make the situation more confusing was the interior decor , it was very nostalgic .
the three drinks for $ 10 was really good .
the happy hour is fabulous ( almost all drinks half off ! )
the fish lacks flavour . the butter chicken tasted better .
the ambiance was very nice , not dark where i could n't see the menu but not glaring bright either .
we split the salud platter , which had a tasty selection of spicy meats and sweet cheeses .
the food is fantastic . the drinks are refreshing and original .
prices are totally reasonable .
he refilled us with hot pita bread when we ran low , asked us if we needed any additional sauces , and cleared our plates for us when we were walking them to the trash .
i gave this one a three stars mostly because we ordered a pitcher or margarita and honestly i did not taste any tequila .
tons of options and amazing food !
good bar to drink at ... but maybe not eat at
the solon restaurant was open and spaced well , but still felt cozy .
it was done just right ; not too dry but it was crispy enough .
i would say its a little tacky but clean .
negatives - the only negative i can think of is the lighting is a bit dull and dated .
i do n't care how busy you might be that is pathetic .
the margaritas and drinks are all very bland and watered down despite what they advertise as `` 1800 '' tequila .
nothing fancy yummy food at decent price !
the room was old and tiny which i could have dealt with too but the wallpaper in bathroom was filthy . the entire bathroom was dirty .
not dry at all .
if i pay $ 120 for a dinner i expect great service .
the patio furniture is a pleasing turquoise and dark brown color scheme , though up close it looks a bit dirty .
i was n't really pleased with the ambiance either because it had a gaudy interior design .
and the tea came out to be very strong .
great food , very sweet staff , fantastic wine list .
the meat is always beautifully cooked with the right amount of spices , i love the first bite since it always has this nice spice kick ( not heat spice but flavour spices ) .
the men 's bathroom had piss all over the floor and smelled disgusting .
the bartender was rude and did n't know anything about the beers on tap .
shrimp was cooked great and paired well with the ingredients on the taco .
kind of creepy actually .
we sat outside as it was a beautiful day .
we also ordered the miso cod , for i believe $ 30.00 , it was bland , i have had better in places that only charged $ 9.00 and lamb for $ 40.00 that did n't even have decent sauce , i have had better for $ 12.00 .
keep up the great food and service !
the atmosphere is pretty depressing and it has a thrift store feel for the interior design .
this casino was cool .
the brisket sandwich is amazing as are their burgers - which are also made with some brisket mixed in .
they do have a happy hour with some great cocktails .
the cookies and cake pops were very moist and delicious .
she knocked it out of the park with a gin raspberry drink and 5 dishes showed up in a flash with the most delicious food .
sadly the most basic elements of service and good tasting food were lacking .
the interior was nice but felt like a knock off , with paint chipped off some of the styrofoam ball ornaments .
they had several beers on tap but not that amazing of a selection of bottled microbrews ( but enough that most people would be happy ) .
bread bar is great but your paying for more than that .
curried chicken soup was amazing .
the food was in no way bland , everything tasted amazing .
i have been to old homestead about a dozen times every time has been fantastic .
really enjoyed this spot . service was great as well .
they also had music on the patio this place is great it 's a sure spot for charlotte ppl to try : )
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
also for their grand opening special you get 2 free raw oysters if you spend $ 20 or more and each oyster going forward is only $ 1 ( you can get up to 10 extra oysters per person as the max ) .
the serving size could be increased a bit more given than its an expensive place .
we had the shrimp tacos and filet mignon nachos . both were delicious .
kinda disappointed ! went there today and was told that they do n't have the a.y.c.e .
bad service and poor management .
the fried rolls were about half the size of the fresh ones , and the couple that ordered them felt pretty jipped .
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
lots of conversations , cell phone and in person , filled the air , with nothing to absorb all of the sound .
i got the pork chops which were very good especially with the apple chutney that was served with it .
they do have alcohol but sadly , no full bar .
when we tried to order drinks , the were out of the only draft beer , negro modelo ... and 3-4 of the bottle beers , and my 1st tequila choice ... then the bartender actually told me the hefeweizen bottle beer was `` just '' like the 2x ipa they were out of ... .really ?
delicious , unique dessert that will satisfy your sweet tooth without the overstuffed , heavy feeling after !
the room was mediocre at best . the floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded .
we felt the interior is modern which is very nice .
it 's one thing to come here and pay for overpriced food , but it 's another when i have to be waited on by unfriendly rude staff .
the prices are just as high if not higher than a steakhouse . need i say more ?
food is not bad but on the high side around $ 10- $ 15 price point but i personally do n't mind coming here if i happen to be downtown .
the drink was good .
we had a great time while there .
it was hard , cold and did not have sauce on it .
went well with a glass of merlot . cappuccino with a hazelnut shot was a perfect way to end my lunch .
they were pretty mild , which i liked , but some people might find them too bland for their taste if they like theirs spicier .
there interior design is `` interesting '' , not sure why there so into the zebra print but to each their own .
great design and atmosphere . nothing we do n't love .
i understand it must be devastating to a business not to be able to serve customers but we are taking time out of our work day to patronize their establishment .
the little chicken sandwich on happy hour are awesome and the bartenders make the best chambord margarita in town .
just a heads up they do n't have liquor , only wine and beer .
ps the lemonade they had was amazing .
when i had ordered for delivery it was very dry , low on sauce and the chicken seemed like it had a different texture due to the dryness .
i love the easy going vibe .
nice wine selection as well .
this is my go-to spot to work on projects and concentrate outside the house . good coffee , friendly staff , free wi-fi , and comfortable seating .
my chicken sandwich was overlooked and bun stale but we split it due we did n't want too chance anything else .
the ambiance was very nice , not dark where i could n't see the menu but not glaring bright either .
and the frozen margarita did n't seem to have hardly any tequila .
i love their chicken , rice and potatoes .
i thought it was awesome they had different drinks to chose from other than the normal sweet tea , fountain drink , or water .
this location works really hard to keep the lines moving .
it said it had eggplant in it which i love , but there were only two pieces of eggplant in it .
i chose amelies for it 's easy of parking , safe environment with plenty of seating , and of course the delicious treats .
overall , expensive ( $ 110 for 3 adults , 4 kids , including the wait-time drinks ) , and a bit over-rated for what you get , but food was good and atmosphere trendy i guess , and the wait time sucked .
they seemed to have a very loyal customer base that does regular take out .
the dinner special prices are very reasonable .
they did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it 's not all about crappy beer .
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
and they around up the number to $ 150 in total .
and the bartender definitely knew how to pour a good , strong drink .
it was ridiculously over priced for only 6 pcs .
i asked for a blended margarita and was told they only do on the rocks . what kind of bar does n't have a blender ?
the staff and owner were great and the bar selection was great !
drinks were of course awesome !
how is it possible that it could be messed up that badly ?
i honestly do n't know why i expected more from this place , i loved the interior design and lighting but the food did not satisfy me at all .
price was right at $ 16.00 for a buffet on a sunday .
2 ) the pomegranate iced tea is all sorts of awesome .
i promptly texted all the guests that were not there yet and told them not to come ( as i was not sure those of us there would get a table ) .
the decor was super outdated and dirty looking though , and the furniture was showing obvious signs of wear .
it lack the rich flavor it had the first time it touched my palate . the rice was more prominent this round , the sauce was disappointingly bland , the only thing i could taste & in succession was rice , then the heat of the jalapeno pepper .
either way you ca n't deny the good atmosphere , good food , and reasonably priced drinks .
its got a great urban vibe , good music mostly , and one long table that i find very charming .
pretty good selection of wine and interesting cocktails on the menu .
the atmosphere was great for sports - lots of aussies hanging around watching the rugby match .
cheap food and lots of it .
i think i like it the most because of mascot , the atmosphere , bright colors and that 's where i get my pencils !
the marble ( i think ? ) steps and the black on the curtains and walls made the restaurant look that much more sophisticated .
the gravy was greasy and bland , the eggs were average , the chicken fried bacon was gross .
the staff were very friendly , overall atmosphere was lovely but upstairs lounge looked a lot more elegant than the downstairs where we were seated .
fantastic food . great free margarita with check in .
service was top notch and very attentive .
unless you have a party of 5+ or are ordering a $ 40+ bottle of wine you are n't going to feel very welcome .
we started with the pineapple upside down martini , what an amazing cocktail .
delicious ! best caesar salad ever .
the service was fine , the side veggies are alright , the free bread with margarine is pretty bad , and the house salad is meh ( only 2 choices for dressing too . )
i just paid $ 10 for food that i ca n't eat , awesome .
after a few minutes of discussion they finally agreed to let us sit at one of the tables with a bench on one side .
the place is not visually appealing either , the vintage cluttered look only brought out the large amount of dust scattered on the decorations .
always a great price the specials are only $ 4.25 and cooked after you order . its really good to get a fresh cooked dinner under $ 5 .
it was hard finding it , it was random where it is at , ghetto feeling casino that felt dingy dirty etc.. interior decor of the restaurant was lack luster ... .
yeah , it 's a little dingy , but that 's kind of part of the charm . sort of .
great value for the price .
the staff were extremely efficient and polite and the store was bright and clean .
.. trendy , great atmosphere , top of the line rooms and equipment !
prices are very economical .
the variety of offerings worked well with our group of 6. the calamari was perfect and the grilled lemon half was a plus .
and the worst part was falooda that is listed under dessert is not a dessert but is a cold beverage .
the food was delicious .
and the prices are very reasonable .
the tootsie was my favorite and my mom loved the spicy tuna !
this pizza was garlicky and cheesy ! my two favorite things on pizza , so i was in heaven !
had a well made martini and a nice bottle of wine , which was half price on sunday !
so if your are driving through , this is a great place to take a break from a road trip .
the special was $ 42 , which made $ 60 after tax and tip ... a little bit expensive imo , but the food was just excellent , and we had some to take home .
great selection in the background music ; totally fits in with the ambiance .
when you walk in there 's all these flowers and it 's so bright and colorful , the uniforms are lame tho , they could do something about that pink housekeeper look .
the sauce was too sweet and did n't have enough flavor for my taste .
service was friendly , prices a tad high , but you get what you pay for .
i 've always loved this place .
a dinner for three people only for 30 bucks .
our bartender/waiter was very enthusiastic and awesome . he chatted us up while we were waiting for our food and was very attentive .
the sushi is kind of pricey but decent . worth the money probably not .
it does get noisy so i would not recommend this place if you are looking for a more intimate setting .
while neither my husband or i drink beer , they look like they have a good selection of bottled and draft beers .
i asked them many times to not do that and they still do , talked to the management they do n't care . they only care about table turnover .
rude as could be .
not having beer descriptions in a beer bar is just wrong .
only real negative was how dark it was ; jet black walls and ceilings , dim lights , but that was n't a big deal .
for the food and drink combined , comes out to about 12 $ per person , which is reasonable .
you always get a beautiful view
meat was dry and overcooked like it had been laying in a pan all day .
the bathroom was huge and i loved the decor .
the chicken salad itself was very disappointing .
fancy , gourmet tacos for a reasonable price .
staff was friendly and attentive .
price is very good .
after calling downstairs it took about 3 hours to get another room and that was only after they sent housekeeping in to see if our complains were legit ... took 45 minutes for them to show up !
price is also right .
an added bonus : these fine folks know their cocktails , so you can have a satisfyingly boozy brunch !
i did find that all the bright colors and decorations did a lot to brighten my mood at 3am .
i heard a lot of good things about this place .
in fact you can easily spend $ 50 on one hand at the casino or one meal in vegas , so this is really a steal .
i 'm certainly a fan of the breakfast poutine at over easy . for travelers , this is one of the nicest little breakfast places in downtown toronto .
by far my favorite restaurant in scottsdale ! every experience that i have had here has been amazing .
we moved down here from the northwest about 6 years ago and had not found truly great thai food in arizona ... that is until tonight .
about $ 15/person , not bad !
lots of hot pot dishes to choose from - includes one bowl of rice .
they have great reasonably priced lunch specials and the all you can eat deal .
beautiful room . nice to relax and not feel like you are in a hotel room .
the food was amazing and cooked perfectly . the mixed drinks were unique and delicious .
what a beautiful shop and nice spot to grab a good quality cup and maybe sit outside and enjoy the neighbourhood .
good variety of items for their all-you-can eat .
i do n't drink beer , but my friends do and they said their beers were just ok , nothing spectacular .
the place is cozy with only a few tables , but was still comfortable .
wine prices are very reasonable and there 's a good variety .
good price - great value .
she looked at me like i was stupid for asking such a question , and said the picture is right there of what you ordered .
it was n't great , honestly . and the salad was pretty good but had some rotten pieces .
even some of the sushi was decent .
there was hardly any beef in it ( trust me , i dug through the pile of rice looking for it ) .
the prices are very reasonable .
it was terrible ... very dry and no flavor . also , it did not taste like chorizo .
the decor inside is nice but weird .
i thought the salmon was a bit dry , and the dish was pretty small for $ 21 a plate with no sides .
not stuffy , not trashy , just right .
what 's not to like - massive rooms , great facilities , unbelievable views of the strip and of course the essential 14th floor rooftop pool .
the prices are about average , but not as ridiculous as the casino sushi places .
ambience : 3/5 , the only fault would be that they should invest in new chairs ( very creaky ) and better lighting .
great atmosphere , super service , fun drinks and yummy healthy eats . explore the drink menu ... both alcoholic and non .
food was very good and rate 5. but charging $ 30 a person and nobody even gets you a drink .
two people can come in , easily spend $ 40 and leave hungry .
the tacos are amazing and so are the appetizers .
and the drinks are perfect .
perhaps this used to be a good place for coffee but it seems the owner / management is n't into this business anymore .
without the groupon it would have been $ 41 , which seems awfully high for one person .
i do n't drink beer but the waitress said they had a good selection .
the lady in the front was telling us that our order was too difficult to make for them .
i ordered the spaghetti which was very bland and boring for the price of $ 15 . the portion was quite small , so i ordered a dessert which as you can see in the picture , was very crumby and old .
i 'm glad it 's in town and with any luck , it will become an institution like lola across the street .
it 's so disgusting and greasy .
service was terrible , sat there for 20mins before being helped . food was pretty solid .
had a white sangria that was disturbingly strong but really delicious and refreshing .
this was a weird one .
burger was edible but not awesome .
this was a horrible experience with horrible food .
do n't know if they know how to communicate but i was standing to be help and the waiter fucking pushed me and i am 8 months pregnant and my belly pushing against the cash register .
they describe the spice accurately - loved the green curry and loved the papaya salad .
they were very soggy and unappetizing !
all in all it was a nice time and a beautiful night .
the food was bland , boring and prepared by uninspired kitchen help not a chef . we would not return .
great happy hour with good drinks .
i had the beet salad , and the coleslaw . everything was great .
my wine was $ 8 or $ 9 cant remember other than it being on the more expensive side for how horrible and warm it was .
they run excellent half price specials .
service was great . music was not too loud .
this was an extremely over priced , confused place .
that in of itself is not a bad thing really , and probably part of the charm , but its painted gray and looks depressing .
great conversation pieces around , great artwork , comfy chairs , etc .
now , i am fully aware everything in vegas is marked up 800 % , but i did n't think my mediocre sized plate of spaghetti and marinara warranted a $ 21 price tag .
they are also great at handling reservations for large parties , but do ask that you order in advance to streamline the process .
we also had the regular and blood orange sangria and it was delicious .
not only the room was so dated , the carpet was very filthy that you should wear slippers or those surgical booties .
when i called the store , the manager told me `` her cooks have been cooking for over 15 years and could not have done anything wrong . ''
walking in , i felt a little intimidated by the overwhelming presence of stuff on the walls and trophies everywhere .
decent burger though it took two attempts to get it cooked a proper rare . it was supposed to come with a side of a special mustard sauce , but what i received bizarrely tasted almost exactly like tartar sauce .
the only issue was the table maintenance was poor .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
you get a good value for what you pay .
kind of cheezy touristy decor but some of the other reviewers seemed to like it . struck me as kind of a applebees over decoration in mexican theme .
no good beers on tap or bottle , so i ordered water .
i love the variety of made to order salads .
the full bar provided a ginger beer and vodka drink that was delicious .
the sashimi roll was wrapped in cucumber and was so refreshing and delicious !
super friendly staff awesome team .
i do n't mind paying higher prices for good food , but it has to be justified .
always great . i typically get the smoked meatloaf ... but i also love the spare ribs and beef brisket .
ambiance : ( read below ) upscale yet tacky at the same time .
great value for the $ $ $ . very inexpensive meals with friendly/helpful staff .
the carpaccio was excellent .
again thought $ 18 for spaghetti and meatballs seems a little high to come considering the cost of the ingredients that being said i was paying more for the atmosphere .
both of our meals were absolutely delicious . he had the steak frites and i had a goat cheese salad .
2.5 stars it 's one of those hole in the walls where you feel really bad about yourself after .
check out the ceiling tiles and the memorable pics from west view park .
the bathroom was nice , but the advertisements in the mirror were tacky .
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
not many beers on tap , but what they had were pretty good .
the food quality is good and the prices are reasonable .
i find that whenever they make me a magic cocktail , i 'm only charged between $ 9- $ 12 per drink .
not muddled properly , and it tasted like gin not rum ... .let 's try the nachos ... .hmmm canned guac , canned jalapeño , and add chicken that is cold and cut up from the night before . at least the spotted beer glasses are cold ... .
prices are on the high side , our bill was about $ 60.00 !
only thing that sucks is there 's at least a 2 hour wait if you try to get in there after 5pm .
got the chance to bring my sister and mom to this spot and have to say it was still amazing .
i think the interior is ugly .
i also ordered a cocktail -- new orlean 's nectar which was very good .
if you are looking for a place to meet friends for drinks , this is a decent place .
great wine list though , and great service .
after spending twenty dollars on each cocktail in the casino lounge it was fantastic to eat for fifty bucks .
at the bar the shots were puny but the beer was cold .
prices not as high as you would expect in scottsdale either .
the only negative i have is that he tables in the middle have poor lighting . they should have a light overhead just like the tables aligned against the wall .
either way , paying $ 15 for two slabs of pork is sad .
the pizza is delicious and the quality is recognizable because it certainly tastes like it was made with love .
another fantastic poke bowl experience . we will be regulars .
my hubby got the filet mignon which was delicious but small .
the beer glasses are n't cold .
the restaurant itself is dark and depressing with terrible colours and decor .
we were pretty happy with the price for kids when we went ( $ 18 vs. $ 25 at some places . )
awesome menu and drinks !
this is my husband and i 's favorite place for sure !
great value for quality food . reasonably priced beer .
perfection ! we loved the crawfish , enchiladas , thai seafood salad , molten chocolate cake , passion fruit tarts , and gelato .
i vote for a dj on thursday nights , heck , i have amazing music , i could just be the dj .
i did n't order it with chicken but when i received my salad it had chicken on it .
hands down the sexiest hotel on earth . the rooms are so plush , inviting and unique !
lighting was harsh too . not exactly sure why it felt that way , but very bright for a restaurant .
prices are very reasonable .
lunch is around $ 17 per head which is ok. the food was good .
prices are too high for the area .
menu is pretty delicious and not over priced .
with a loud no , no toilets .
they had about 15 beers on tap and they were pretty impressive .
a little cold however and we ended up waiting an hour before we got our food . the waitress was friendly however .
tiny dance floor , no seating for dancers , lighting wrong , atmosphere `` created in haste '' , bad , bad , bad .
the atmosphere was great , except for the constant flickering of the track lighting ( it was quite distracting ) .
i do n't drink beer but they have a great selection of beer as well as wine .
good prices . good food .
it 's creepy and uncomfortable .
it 's a huge meal , but the quality of the food was also very good .
this location is amazing !
drinks are strong and yummy !
very friendly staff and the food was amazing .
- although they only had three beers on tap , at least they were good craft beer choices .
when we tried to order drinks , the were out of the only draft beer , negro modelo ... and 3-4 of the bottle beers , and my 1st tequila choice ... then the bartender actually told me the hefeweizen bottle beer was `` just '' like the 2x ipa they were out of ... .really ?
been going there for years , my parents favorite .
ca n't say enough how this is a great location for them , glad there 's more space in the store than east blvd 'cause you guys are going to need it !
pair this with a great beer and whiskey list , and you 're in heaven !
lunch prices are cheap for what you get .
they gave me super greasy pork that did not seem grilled , nem nuong , and a shrimp skewer which is not what i ordered ; i only realized once i brought it home . it left my mouth feeling super oily and i was sad i did n't get my sugar cane shrimp since that 's the only reason why i ordered it .
it 's definitely one of my favorite spots .
great selection of pizzas , sandwiches and salads .
our waitress patty , only came to our table once due to the fact that she needed to get our orders .
cute date spot food was okay .
young vibe and had great paintings on the walls .
was n't a fan of the mongolian beef or the kung pow , the beef was dry and the chicken was pretty small and did n't have much spice .
$ 17 for a 12 '' pie is a bit ridiculous .
both were served in very small bowls with one small piece of chicken ( very hard and burnt around the edged ) and one very small piece of eggplant ( as very hard and burnt around the edges ) .
where better to go than the buffet , right ? we missed the breakfast cut off but the difference in price was only $ 5.00 per person .
drinks were delicious and actually packed a punch ( which can be difficult at many happy hours ) and the food was incredible !
we did not complain but the waitress realized we were less then satisfied .
quite happy with the friendly service and how fast things came . also liked being informed of the specials ( 4 dollar blonde beers ) were great .
the broth was good but overall could have used a bit more body , and the tofu was a pretty pointless addition to the dish .
apparently they have one server who can only handle one table at a time . maybe placed an order for pickup ?
we ordered the twig & berries ( new favorite drink ) .
seems like a good place to just hang out and have drinks with your friends .
lunch specials are good and the price is great .
it 's a lot of money to spend on bad service and cold food .
the prices are reasonable .
good bagels . the everything bagel was delicious .
it 's so evident that these people not only see a problem in our food system , but care deeply enough to do something different about it .
giving them two stars just coz the interior is sort of cute .
and that certainly was n't house-made champagne .
not a bad bar .
what a great place !
also delicious were the drinks ! i had the pomegranate jalepeno ( i think ) margarita and it was really unique and delicious .
the decoration is pretty much random .
it does n't need much , just a new paint job , lighting update and some carefully placed decor and it would look 100x better .
service in general was great , our waitress was attentive at all times and everyone is nice and smiling . great food and atmosphere !
service was excellent . wine list is fantastic .
i asked for a hefeweizen but no ; they have 30 beers on tap including 6 different ipas , but not a hefeweizen in the house .
not happy about being `` nickel and dimed '' after spending $ 14 for a dip .
the veggie grill comes with a huge portion of grilled veggies - they hit the spot .
other than that , great roll & service !
talk about a depressing background to your meal .
oreo gelato not so much- i did n't like the mahi on the bamboo ( not sure why you cook it on bamboo ) .
i opted for a glass of rose and told the waiter to just give up on the gin fizz .
they have the best hot sauces !
service : place was full but we were greeted and seated immediately . food arrived fast and server was attentive .
too cold , soft and bland .
pasta itself was perfectly al dente and fresh . al dente fresh pasta is an art , which is done well here .
i also ordered sweet potato fries , they were okay but i hate that they tasted like they were factory cut .
no good . clean but weird decor .
the salmon is very good .
love their chicken salad . the herbed bread is to die for !
one time i went into the store and they were abrupt and rude . and then today we went to the drive thru .
crab cakes are awesome . service is wonderful .
everything comes out in very small portion too .
the only let down was that there was no beer on tap .
the food was really good but the management was better , if that is possible .
it 's cheap so you get cheap service .
this location is very good .
in contrast , the rolls from dong a tend to take a much longer time to `` deteriorate '' ( the skin does n't get tough , but the shrimp starts to `` go '' and there 's a slimy feeling to the roll ) .
i recommend the szechuan chicken ... sooo good !
but what slices does offer is a great pizza with fresh ingredients and a unique taste to the sauce that i ca n't quite put my hands on , but loved it .
the muffins and pastries are made in house and are perfectly moist and flavored .
after rolling by a ton of places lit up with fancy signs and neon lights , pulled up to this restaurant not expecting much . how wrong was i .
i am not a country fan but the band and crowd was a lot of fun . yes it is loud and raucous but is n't that the point ?
a couple of friends suggested this place for lunch , so i tagged along with them for my first visit and was very pleasantly surprised .
the wine list was good .
even the margarita was bad .
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
i love this place .
nothing special and was not crispy enough .
yes the food is priced reasonable as well .
i was sorely disappointed .
not bad considering the total for that would be $ 32 plus tax .
their drinks are all super refreshing .
though the prices are not cheap , they are known for their food .
great value at a great price .
beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor . or at least the menu was .
keep up the good work , good service and good food guys .
the table behind us still had n't received their food when we were leaving and were complaining to the waitress .
tons of choices , prompt service , cheap pricing .
good food , great prices .
shocking at $ 40 steak would be that thin .
but be prepared to share dishes the portion sizes were amazing .
they had a pretty decent beer selection from what i recall . additionally they offered wine selections .
it was too sweet for my taste and i ended up leaving most of it behind .
the restaurant itself is kind of ... dingy .
the wait staff is nice and the booths are comfortable .
i like coleslaw that is crunchy and theirs is pretty soggy and flavorless .
this would be a good safe place to bring your family and friends .
i only see about two people working . did n't get an drink refills either
if you staying to dine in , there are plenty of seats and a nice couch area . they also have free wifi and it 's fairly quiet inside .
nice ambiance for special occasions , date night or girls night out .
pretty good pizza , but it was expensive and small for the price . $ 11.99 for a personal 9 '' pizza was a bit steep , but it was still very good .
taste of food good but temperature went from barely lukewarm to almost hot even baked potato tasted like barely warm . when did they cook it ?
to begin with the tables , booths , fake plants and sagging ceiling tiles are any combination of worn out , dirty or sticky .
we were the only people there the whole time , that 's worrisome .
i did n't get her name since she just gave me a bad impression once we entered the restaurant .
the people that work here are all so nice . we are sunday regulars .
whether i 'm feeling tex-mex or a burger , it 's a great , family friendly place .
sorry but it 's $ 12 for 2 large pizzas being that they have their 5.99 special .
my one complaint was that the men 's bathroom was shockingly dirty and in serious need of repair .
and it 's cheap .
our waitress valerie was knowledgeable and pleasant .
the curry was rich , and flavourful , but the sticky rice was hard in a way that it did n't taste fresh .
i also ordered a regular vodka martini , which was excellent .
i mean pest control is not that hard and if you have a problem take care of it .
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
the decor here is super nice as with most places in this neighbourhood and the concept reminds me of a hipster chipotle .
the restaurant itself is beautiful .
their lunch special prices were very reasonable .
but the beer was disappointing .
service could be slow but it was n't awful .
almost forgot about my terrible coronarita ... cheap margarita mix in a normal drinking glass with a corona sticking out .
just a heads up they do n't have liquor , only wine and beer .
neon lights flashing around all the time is n't the most relaxing , but it 's not terrible either .
$ 5.00 a slice and $ 25.00 for a large cheese is the most expensive pizza i 've ever seen .
our friendly server told us that the craft beers rotate so often that he was printing up a brand new list which he handed to us fresh off the printer ; ) besides craft beer and cider , wine and cocktails , as well as non-alcoholic beverages are on the drink menu .
the atmosphere is just plain stupid and tacky .
i highly recommend trying the edamame as an appetizer . everything tasted fresh and well prepared .
good portions . priced right .
good food , reasonable prices ... it 's a known quantity .
the pasta with ricotta and corn was fresh , something different and overall awesome . dessert was very nice .
still waiting for my food ... long wait times we made a reservation and they gave our seats to someone else and said sorry . there are other bad reviews too online .
such a great atmosphere .
prices also abit high compared to other places and not as justified since they are abit shabby .
love that i can shop here before or after i have eaten .
not sure how the server did n't notice this before he sat it down on my napkin .
she was courteous and if she is n't the manager she should be . give her a raise ... .she suggested things to try and was super sweet .
atmosphere inside can be a bit overwhelming , as the interior is surprisingly large , but the plus is there 's usually lots of seating if you 're trying to dine in .
it is quite possibly the least expensive buffet ( as low as $ 9 for lunch with free membership card ) in any casino .
would definitely recommend this location bc it is small and intimate and the owner is really hands on and tries to make sure you have a great time !
3 stars are for large portion and taste because it did taste pretty good i think due to the fact that mediterranean food is pretty hard to mess up .
walked in and was n't greeted nor did we know if we should seat ourselves or if we had to wait . finally we were told to just sit anywhere .
i would give it 5 stars if they did not have such bright fluorescent lighting , which makes the place feel like a hospital cafeteria .
if you need to study , there is an upstairs portion with a good amount of seating .
beer selection was horrible ( typical of canada ) and on top of that they were out of the one beer that 's barely drinkable . wine selection was nearly as bad .
the ambiance is great .
in addition to having well selected beer and wine offerings , the food was also quite good .
pho was satisfying and hearty . super green salad - beautiful and delightful .
they had one that was a variety of olives on top - wow - it was great .
the downside , they were really fatty and the meat that was there was very tough .
the food is fresh , high quality , delicious and reasonably priced .
staff was very friendly !
for both of us it was about $ 40 , which i think is a fair price .
it 's in an awesome art district area that has great graffiti and great eats ...
i did n't really like the berry sake mojito ( too sweet ) , but the rest of the food was great .
i felt totally distracted for some reason by the decor and ambiance .
i only got upset after she hung up on me the first time : / what a witch .
it 's good , decent portions , for decent prices .
total paid was $ 33 for all this food , expensive and not worth it .
they are very fast , friendly , and reasonably priced .
the bottled beer was n't as cold as we like it .
my caesar salad was wilted , with rubbery cheese , dry chicken and weird extra toppings .
for only being open a week when we ventured in on a saturday night , we were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff and the diversity of the menu .
3 ) the shop and employees look really sad because the decor , layout and color scheme do n't do the place any favors .
i thought it was awesome they had different drinks to chose from other than the normal sweet tea , fountain drink , or water .
but he warned , i 'm pretty sure it 's basically margarita flavored beer .
the art , the music . the food is minimal but very good .
went here for the first time about three weeks ago and it was great , the drinks and the prices ! we went again this past weekend and it was excellent ... the food and our waiter ian was awesome .
i have been going to this restaurant for over 7 years and it is just as amazing as the first time i ever visited !
reasonable prices as well .
it 's straightforward delicious with juicy morsels of marinated beef perfectly paired with melty cheese sandwiched between perfectly grilled texas toast , what 's there not to like ?
seemed that the margaritas were the specialty but was not impressed , plus it came in a beer pint glass.. ?
curry can be oily , watery , too spicy , or too bland . noodles can be too grainy or too soft , and break easily .
my wife had the veggie burger which tasted more like an extremely thick falafel not bad but not a burger .
i give it 5 stars because the food is great , and the decor reminded me so much of my little parisian cafes , i fell in love .
the first bartender was kind of an asshole , i asked if we could order food in the lounge and his response was to sigh and say `` i guess . ''
mac & cheese has amazing flavor especially with the crisp on top .
people joined our table and were not served , orders were forgotten , delivered to the wrong table , and so forth .
nice , fun place .
the place is very clean , excellent service with a smile and the food was spot on .
not only did get get the dogs wrong , they got the quantity wrong and forgot the drinks .
great ambience , beer , and wine .
it was a beautiful cleveland fall evening when we went to hansa brewery so we were able to sit on their expansive patio .
the lighting was bright so i do know it was n't too dirty .
is it great value ? definitely .
clean , open , classy décor , not the regular take out motif .
i tried putting it in the microwave , but that seemed to make it worse .
also nice little patio area to eat if the weather is nice .
i love you guys !
the fries were hard to eat because they were so thin .
the price was n't bad at all around 12 dollars for a large cheese only .
their cocktails are quite refreshing , a favorite of ours was their kentucky mule .
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
the owner came to our table every 15 minutes making sure everything was okay .
server was very attentive .
went to cork just for drinks with a large group -- the bar is awesome .
the decor and vibe of the entire restaurant was very cool .
the prices are very reasonable as well .
the food is amazing and the owners are wonderful . hummus steak skewers and asian food were all phenomenal
good value for the price ! plus it 's open late , which is a nice plus !
they should have just made it chicken .
i 've tried the dumplings and they are also really good .
the hushpuppies were amazing , best we ever had .
the walls are not drab and filled with nazi signs screaming about fat is bad or banning butter .
the service was fantastic . our server was incredibly friendly , informative , and attentive .
good - the sitting area is clean .
after paying , i was handed a pager and we went to secure a table .
the marquis pool party is one of the best pool parties i have been to & the marquis night club is just beautiful and out of this world !
food was cold and the establishment was n't even busy .
they did n't have any beer on tap , only select few bottles which was disappointing .
finally , i caught one of the guys that was running by and asked for what we needed .
the drinks are pretty good , we had some beer and girly drinks ( strawberry margarita and mojitos ) which tasted not so bad and the fresh chips and salsa were kept us from going hungry while we waited for our actual food ( the service is really slow ) .
i ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with a side salad , and my husband ordered the new york steak .
they have the best meals , the menu contains a variety of items , the service is excellent and best of all the food taste very delicious !
the spring rolls , dumplings , and chicken wings were all nice add ons as well .
sadly , it was nothing good .
i miss not having an awkward swivel table , blocking the drink holder , with an obnoxious led light .
it 's a large part of why we do n't come hardly at all anymore . maybe it 's time we just stop entirely ?
the signature martini ( made with pineapple infused vodka ) , was fabulous .
unique selection of drinks , try the pineapple margarita .
ca n't explain why but it seems very harsh and not homey despite the booths lining the walls of the place .
the result is an uncomfortable hour-long struggle to not slip off the `` stool '' onto the floor !
horrible ! who would ever wait in line for this slop ?
very good for the price .
awesome location and excellent service .
the ambiance of the store and the restaurant makes me feel like i 'm out of town , on a fun getaway , in a quaint little town . the cuban club is amazing .
nothing special about it and at a cost of pennies from $ 30.00 that is no special !
we all tried the drink on special , which involved midori and dry ice .
very reasonable prices ( ~ $ 10 each after taxes and tip ) , and you definitely wo n't leave hungry .
wonderful atmosphere -- located inside the canal shops with seating right on the water . we got to watch and listen as the gondolas passed by .
the veggies were cooked great but had no flavor or seasoning for that matter .
a poor value . way overpriced for what you get .
fried and steamed dumplings are great , singapore rice noodles , and kung pow chicken are all worth ordering .
this place is so good .
i had to wait longer than the people around me who ordered after me because they ordered the special , which seemed pretty popular ( deep fried fish on a roll with mac and cheese ) .
bbq chicken rolls very good ! excellent rare beef , the white chicken in soup not so good .
very tender chicken pieces amidst slices of carrots , zuchinni , onion , celery , various peppers , mushrooms , and this amazing red sauce which they will make as spicy as you want .
the lasagne and pasta were fine , but the puttanesca was pretty awful ; much too oily and mixed with slices of rather vile sausage .
i was n't a fan of the fried rice , but other people liked it .
ordered meatballs , they came out cold , not warm but cold .
my fish was cold and i thought that was weird , until i cut into it more and it was undercooked .
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
great food and drinks . and happy hour to go with it .
the person on the phone refused to get the manager and after a great ordeal and a few laughs from him , he finally got the manager .
we ordered some saki and a couple apps to start . the happy hour was great !
it 's totally faded .
i got my beer and i ordered dos equis but they brought another kind , but beer was beer and need beer in me .
plus it 's a fantastic deal , 3.99 !
our waiter was a great efficient guy .
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
had a great dinner last night , but more important , great service !
we were seated even though our entire party was not there , but it was okay .
the only 2 beers available was budlight and `` house special beer '' which tasted like piss water .
we ordered the california roll and that was disgusting .
if they ca n't provide a box for the price , raise the price . ridiculous .
the atmosphere was also horrible . the lighting was insufficient , and place just looked pretty outdated .
great sandwiches at a low price .
the food is well-presented and maybe looks a bit better than the taste . the burgers were a bit `` sloppy '' but with a good taste .
love the fresh steamed broccoli and chicken at this place !
the portion was small and not very tasty . however , the service was excellent .
music is loud , and combined with the people , it forms a incoherent droning sound that can make it difficult to understand what 's being said .
the only negative , if you need the restroom bring a flashlight the lighting is really dim .
went here saturday . place was hopping but food and service were excellent .
the staff was super friendly and attentive .
the cocktails were delicious and proportioned to maximize strength without compromising taste .
my friend got a plain mojito , but was just as happy with her drink as i was .
the only thing worse than the ticket times in this place is the attitude .
just a series of hallways and if you figure out the maze you get rewarded with poor quality food .
the margaritas were so weak i 'm not sure they even had tequila .
i love the spring roll here .
unfortunately the restaurant version is not good - at all . not one of the ingredients in the combo bowl was worth eating ; not the rice , not the lettuce , not the tomatoes , not the onions , not the olives , not the jalapenos , not the pita and for sure not the `` beef '' or chicken .
reasonably priced for fresh food - they offered a small selection of beers , also . extremely clean , very reasonably priced .
my risotto was divine and the grilled scallops - a notoriously difficult dish to prepare - were cooked perfectly .
it was a beautiful night but unfortunately the area they sat us in was super dark .
prices are very reasonable for what you get ( good portions and good quality ) .
this place has very nice atmosphere .
annoying . also the bathroom people freak me out .
this place is awesome ! a great edition to our las vegas food community .
the cashew chicken was okay but there was not a single cashew in the dish ( likely they forgot to add them ) .
food was good , hot and tons of it !
the layout is kind of odd though .
the colour scheme and lighting was subdued but elegant making think it was going to be expensive .
we shared a bottle of wine and enjoyed a fabulous evening .
not only was the food not great , service was very slow and it was such a hassle for our server to split our bill .
the green chili pork hand pie was our favorite .
we also had margaritas which you could hardly taste anything but a pre-made margarita mix .
customers do n't deserve to start a bad day because of the server 's bad service and attitude when they are trying to spend a quality time with their family and with good food .
no one at any time of day look or feel good under fluorescent lights .
i love this place . excellent food , beautiful decor and upstairs has a cool snack menu that i 'm obsessed with .
service here is decent . on busy nights , the service is impeccable .
the house chow mein was better but the chunks of chicken were huge and should 've been cut into smaller pieces to match the other proteins on the plate . it was also too oily .
crazy inexpensive for very good quality meal .
the decor is kind of rustic and eclectic , and the place feels welcoming .
will most likely come again every time i 'm in vegas .
my husband 's sweet tea sat empty for an unreasonable amount of time given the prices this place charges .
the lighting was a bit dim , but still enough light that i was n't squinting .
unfortunately , i was n't terribly impressed with the food .
$ 200 for four for lunch is a little pricey but its not somewhere you go everyday .
the service was really terrible .
this place is pretty good . do n't let the chipped paint on the walls make you think otherwise .
it was so bad that i could n't tell the steak from pork by taste .
tequila selection was pretty good but the bartenders were clearly hired for other credentials than tequila knowledge , if you catch my drift .
my first order here was the caesar salad , and it was fantastic .
if you thought those two strong taste dishes do n't have enough taste , it 's probably you have heavy taste on food .
i love this place and def think it 's like going to a family member 's home for dinner - good homelike meal feel .
i have been here a couple of times , but today was a little bit late , around 1pm .
it is casual fine dining .
but then it would n't be the `` dirty o '' would it ?
soups are very good and piping hot .
the patio upstairs has a great view .
nice atmosphere though , for a friday after work chill .
for the prices they charge , i expect the food to at least be halfway decent .
this is a great little place to chill with friends .
prices are very reasonable .
i am amazed that this place has decent reviews .
same with the sushi . it was fresh , but the quality of the fish was of the lowest grade and therefore tasteless .
amazing food ! helpful and friendly staff .
the staff was friendly and attentive .
the price is a tad high , but you do get what you pay for .
love this place . do n't let the location fool you .
doug the chef is personable and friendly , always taking time to come say hello and offer something special for guests to sample .
i asked the waitress for their best bourbon drink and she came back with an awesome smokey cocktail . also had the cubano sandwich and it was delicious .
for what you 're getting for about $ 36 pops a person ai n't bad at all !
drink menu was excellent .
the hardest part is getting by the really bitchy chick at the reservation stand . her customer service was the worst i have seen in a while .
the mens room had no paper towels and the women 's bathroom my wife said was so dirty with towels on the floor everywhere .
the layout of the restaurant seems odd in that i felt kind of exposed at the table .
the beer glasses were n't even frothy , and the beers on tap that arrived were n't even cold .
oreo pancakes are super unique and delicious . the omelettes are fluffy and amazing , and the hashbrowns are way cool .
awesome restaurant . great food and wine pairing .
my room was beautiful .
the value is great for what you pay . i would say the sushi is 7 out of 10 and price is 10 out of 10. the portions are huge .
best in town by far .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
we ordered bottled beers -- their beer selection is good , i will give them that .
the prices are very reasonable . the lunch specials are large , tasty and under 6 bucks .
help always friendly and fast service ! i love it !
here 's my impression : decor : pretty sterile and unwelcoming .
beer selection was weak as well , and their bottle menu was inaccurate .
the bathroom was weird . it had glow in the dark graffiti everywhere which made it poorly lit and not at all good for fixing your lipstick .
they do have alcohol but sadly , no full bar .
but it was spiced so weird .
honestly , i can make better shrimp at home , and i hardly call myself a cook , besides the literal form ( as in no longer raw when i am done with it ) .
we enjoyed a couple nice bottles of wine , excellent company and a great meal .
they were just awful and i do not think the tequila was patron .
i ordered the bacon and egg sandwich ... it was good but nothing really special about it .
for everything it was $ 70 not including tax , prices were good .
the waitress knew it was n't good but did n't do anything .
prices are good . staff is kind .
but i must say , the fish quality was really good and tastes fresh .
for the prices they charge , it 's expensive for what it is .
i tried the dinner with the wine pairing . amazing pairings for sure .
ordered a couple beers but the drafts were not that cold .
not sure if it was the side of the restaurant where we were in but i found the ambiance to be a bit depressing - the dim lighting , greyish walls ( with mysterious stains on them ) took away from my experience at the restaurant .
the service provided by our server , jessica , was fantastic .
brunch was buffet-style with a huge assortment of food - from waffles , to lobster legs , egg dishes , baked ham , and everything in between .
prices increased somewhat ... it is now usually $ 9.50 for breakfast ... which since they include beverages in it now is only 35 cents more than it was ... but you do n't have the option to not get a beverage .
the atmosphere is just plain stupid and tacky .
great food , nice new and clean store . eaten here several times since they opened and never am disappointed .
very fair prices as well and some nice drink specials .
this place is my favorite place to order from in all of las vegas !
but , surprisingly , it tasted pretty good .
they also had a nice selection of drinks .
annoying . also the bathroom people freak me out .
the location is great . the building and atmosphere is great .
the wait was an hour and 15 minutes for a mediocre streak everyone in party of 5 agreed ... our server jessica was very sweet though . wo n't be coming back for the food !
we walked in at 3:45 and they were n't sure they could seat us because we did n't have reservations .
ordered a beer in the bottle as they only had the typical `` crap '' in my opinion on draft .
to top it off no draft beer in the theater only the bar ?
we love this restaurant .
the rice was kind of mushy as well as the chickpeas .
i washed it down with some sangria which was wonderfully refreshing .
our appetizers were cold and our sweet potato fries were also cold , soggy , and flavorless .
the chicken meatballs were just ok. they were a tad bland and dry , so thank goodness it came with a cilantro pesto .
so , i 've been here 3-4 times and think i can give a honest review .
i come here for the fried chicken salad . soo good .
this is secretly my favourite part about coming here.. i want to bottle it up and take it home .
we did n't try any cocktails , but the beer selection was n't too bad .
i guess it was decent food , but the main trend we noticed was that everything was super salty .
the pizzas are also great .
the price point is economical too .
they actually are kind of limp and , well , icky as they sit in the cup and steam .
the margarita was made strong and well .
while neither my husband or i drink beer , they look like they have a good selection of bottled and draft beers .
we had different flavored koolaid type drinks ; they were good as well .
the bathroom was beautiful and spotless but i 'll just say this : i hate bathroom attendants . that is all .
i heard their ramen is amazing so maybe i 'll have to try that sometime , too .
the potato salad was fantastic . all great stuff !
the pickled veggies are excellent .
plenty of food for a reasonable price .
ridiculous , they lose a start for ridiculous prices .
also it was somewhat filthy , curtains , ceiling , floor and bathroom ... ... disgusting !
there 's a nice lunch special too during the week too - $ 5.99 i believe .
and a great price .
there was nothing overly special about the pad thai or yellow curry . nothing in flavor that screamed `` wow that was really good . ''
i like that they have gluten free soy sauce but the price per packet seems a little high .
the dinner portions , however , are pretty large and i can usually make two meals out of one entree .
the flavor was just perfect , it was n't salty and the gravy did n't lack any flavor .
the food was n't kept hot and was pretty bland .
the decor and pink walls are pretty , but that 's about it .
amazing ! i had the carnitas plate and it was so good .
really excellent food . taste authentic and fresh .
i absolutely love this place . their unique ingredients in the different nacho dishes are tasty but my favorite here are the burritos
i feel this is a result of a greedy owner/manager to make sure they dont lose business .
five stars for food . the sole reason for one star is the unappealing glaring cold fluorescent lighting in this place .
the bun was pretty cheap and mushy after being soaked through .
both the the beef soup and the pork are very , very good , and moreso the spicy version .
i 've been here twice in one week . i highly recommend it .
amazing cuisine and the butter cake for desert is a must try - so delicious !
we served eggplant parmesan and chicken picatta . both were delicious !
our waiter was fantastic as he helped greatly with the menu .
only thing that was good was the dirty martini and wine .
waiter say chief only train 40 minutes and can not make .
then , i asked if they were usually not busy and she explained that during the winter they 're not too popular .
i highly recommend this restaurant .
so instead i had their pretzel breakfast sandwich which was quite delicious .
this location is new and the resturant is beautiful . love the bar top .
room was nice , but expected more . hallway was dirty , bathroom ceiling had hair stuck to it , ( gross ) , no coffee maker or refrigerator .
ad far as price , starters are $ 20-30 and entrees are in the $ 50 range .
everyone is in a good mood .
i did n't drink but i saw a good selection of their beer and a beer sampler that looked interesting .
i had a 12oz outback signature sirloin and it was very good , cooked a perfect medium rare and nicely seasoned . the garlic mashed potatoes and cesar salad were delicious as well .
but the food itself was great the kebob platter and the fattoush salad was excellent .
so fresh and so filling but not overwhelming .
sure i did n't know what i wanted , so it took me a while to order .
pizza was mediocre , with an expensive price tag . pizza and side if wings for 50 bucks is expensive .
from the welcome to a thank you for coming ... thank you for a delicious experience .
i had two beers and the beer was cold .
i come here for the lunch specials as they are priced pretty well .
try to thai local favorites which are special and unique to be added to our favorite dishes .
the cafe is intimate with an open kitchen so you can see the chefs preparing the food .
i do wish there was as more of a comfortable seating area but that factor does n't stop us from returning .
it looks nice , but the set up was quite awkward .
for a hotel restaurant , where the prices and service often reflect the fact that they think you are captive to their $ 15 tuna sandwiches and their $ 20 omelets ) .
their prices are quite good too .
it 's in the ghetto and feels ghetto but it 's amazing ! so do n't let the looks put you off .
the food is decent but i did n't think it was good enough to justify the cost . it was expensive for meh ... .
we ordered beers from a so-so beer list , and they were out of that beer , ordered a different beer , out of it too .
the environment is low key chill , with a trendy vibe .
i am really glad that i tried this place before i read the reviews .
it 's a mid-range resort only interested in providing sub-par customer service and shuffling people through their cattle operation .
the view was fabulous in the spinning dining room .
so this was a pleasant surprise .
only dish we liked was the beef tartare , but the crusty bread that came with it was overly oily .
i kept thinking , `` does my nose look shiny ? '' ( the things you think about in poor lighting ) .
my personal favorite is the $ 5 foot long menu .
the worst meal that i ever had .
paintings ) are weird , but i guess they 'd be good ice breakers or conversation starters .
it was hard finding it , it was random where it is at , ghetto feeling casino that felt dingy dirty etc.. interior decor of the restaurant was lack luster ... .
we 're so happy to have this place in the neighborhood .
will always consider eating here when in the area with all the intense restaurant competition around because of the food and service .
this place gets packed on the weekend ... .and for good reason !
i must say though that the food was extremely salty .
the prices are decent too for the quality you get .
the atmosphere is nice .
nice location and attractive setting .
they have a good beer selection but unfortunately the beers we ordered were flat .
prices even at happy hour are a bit high , usually 2 rolls and a sashimi , with beer , costs me around $ 25- $ 30 .
after paying my cheap admission price of ~ $ 12 , i was eager to start my dinner with hopes it would be decent given all the hype .
i wish i lived closer to this place just because it is that good .
clam chowders are both awesome . shrimp cocktail are huge and tasty .
these wings were n't bad do n't get me wrong but for $ 16.50 they are waaaaaay over priced .
and , the room is very bland ... .. just beige walls .
there were lots of hot foods , the beef ribs in particular are so juicy and tender .
the spicy sauce was good , but not memorable , and it came with way too little of it .
he then tried to guilt us by telling us how they do not like to waste food , wow , real classy .
bad use of over $ 30 for 2 burgers .
after eating mars which had a strong taste , the cup dessert was light and refreshing .
it was so filling and reasonably priced .
only negative , not many beers on tap , we ordered three times before we got a beer listed that they actually had on tap : (
the prices were not outrageous .
we went in for brunch , i got the peach lemonade with rum which was delicious .
no cheap statues or posters hanging on the wall that are supposed to give you the hint you 're in another world .
fish quality is outstanding .
all together about $ 60 which is n't bad for an awesome meal .
they have a nice outdoor sitting area with grass for the kids to play in .
with most of the games costing at least a dollar , this can get annoying fairly quickly .
not crazy about the overhead lighting - even though they 've gelled it in pretty colors , it still feels harsh .
beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor . or at least the menu was .
the sauce and meatballs were altogether flavorless . the only saving grace of the meal was the garlic knots .
the service was very poor and i ca n't in good conscience recommend this restaurant to anyone .
they are hard and tasted like they were leftover from the night before .
while the pho was tasty , i was disappointed with the portion size .
i like the weird , cheap feel of the decor because it sends snooty people away .
amazing staff , pretty amazing happy hour and thursdays are half off wine bottles ! our server nick was fantastic !
ambiance is terrible . the music is loud and obnoxious .
so very disappointed , and the cost was another issue . it was n't worth the $ 20 , more like $ 4.99 and that 's stretching it .
reasonable prices especially for the strip .
the lunch specials are very nicely priced at around $ 7 for two items .
great venue with a good vibe and music to match .
enjoyed dining in the enclosed patio .
the food is magnificent , the best coney dog and fresh cut fries ever .
the fish tacos at that point were over cooked and dry .
cheap price for good food .
cocktails well made and strong .
the space is small and stuffed with tables so in winter when everyone has a winter jacket it feels a little claustrophobic .
staff was attentive and nice .
on my visit i had wine which was decent ( note- i wanted sangria but they were out : ( ) and a panini .
i 've been coming here since college and this is honestly one of my favorite local finds .
besides the food being amazing ! the staff was extremely friendly .
the wine ( by the glass ) was tasty and reasonably prized . i really liked the ambiance of the restaurant .
i 'm not talking about your normal cracks and creeks i 'm talking full on loud construction type noises .
terrible . the employees seem clueless and the sandwiches are nothing like the detailed description given .
when i say drinks i mean sodas - no special bar drink or something .
i had the chicken sandwich with arugula salad , as well as a blueberry mojito ( mojito is not part of hh menu ) .
when you need comfort food and a great time with your family or friends , this is the spot .
everyone was so nice and accommodating .
the music is never to loud or obnoxious , it is rather enjoyable to get a table near the stage and listen to some great music as you enjoy a fantastic meal .
the ugly - too many tables in such less space . i felt horribly claustrophobic inside especially with the lights being so dim .
it is a soy protein that tastes just like chicken .
let 's see : bad lighting , uncomfortable sheets , water so hard if you use a wash cloth on your skin with it you could potentially tear the skin right off your body , an ac unit that just does n't work , terribly thin walls and you can see the light coming in from the hallway -- hope you 're not expecting privacy !
the prices are cheap for the amount of food you get .
the sangria was good .
not sure who 's idea the ceiling was but that 's pretty cool .
score ! the ingredients are fresh , the food is creative , and the mad spice is amazing !
very nice staff . the price is also lower .
i ordered the chicken ceasar pasta salad - it was terrible .
tiny not special at all pizza for over $ 20 .
decor is nice , but the only thing that bothers me about this place is the fact that there are circle prints on the walls .
the only disappointment here was the lomi was n't very fond of it .
we love their curry and roti , grilled chicken + spring roll vermicelli , and their rare beef pho ( broth is decent and always piping hot ) .
i started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila .
drinks are served in these gorgeous green glasses .
we have been to pittsburgh a lot the past couple of years on weekend vacations ... we love shopping the strip district , especially with all the mom and pop shops ... .
all the curtains were down too which made it unnecessarily dark . mediocre .
i love the food , and i think it is significant to note that they offer more than donuts and sweet rolls ; the salads and sandwiches are great !
the waitress did nothing to fix the problem except `` sorry '' .
not a bad meal but was expecting better .
plus it is reasonably priced .
eh . after reading the reviews and standing in line for about 25-30 minutes , i was expecting some spectacular , mind boggling , better than sex kind of a sandwich but sorely , it did n't live up to the hype .
it 's kind of tacky .
i went on a friday night and all the tables inside are already reserved but i was able to get a patio sitting which was very nice .
and the decor was just ... outdated .
i found the price a bit high with the four margaritas , total about 55.00 total food and everything .
i also got the sweet potato fries priced around $ 12 after tax and tips which would be considered on a higher price since you do get a really small portion .
only bummer for me was their bathroom lights = ( i know that may be the style they 're going for but i do n't like it when its dark in there . spooky .
( just to add a little more color imagine caviar served on a soggy , cold wheat cracker ... blech )
the hand towels in the bathroom had stains on them , the water from the sink had a horrible smell , ugh .
what i loved especially today was the superb customer service !
the decor is is nice and simple -- very traditional . the food is very unique in that you are not getting your traditional bento box with salad , miso , and chicken teriyaki .
also were barely warm .
it can be a bit noisy due to the ceiling reflecting sound around you but not terrible .
pretty good wine selection i guess , i 'm not a wine guy . not much of a beer selection for being a beer and wine bar .
kensington is one of my favorite places and this is one of the reasons why !
so i tried to ask scenarios and they still acted as ignorant as possible .
thought some of them tasted a bit bland at first but then we realized they have bbq sauce in a soy sauce bottle .
so upsetting how this great place went to crap !
we added the ice from the margarita glass which was a tall glass skinny filled to the brim with ice to the tea .
way overrated burger . hard to believe when paying 21 $ .
the atmosphere is chic and i like how the sheer curtains give you a sense of privacy ( even though they do manage to fit a lot of people in ) .
they over heard about the special occasion and surprised us with glasses of bubbly wine .
the restaurant lighting is also kind of funny , it 's not dark or light ... just something in the middle which gave you a weird feeling .
not having beer descriptions in a beer bar is just wrong .
i would give it 5 stars if they removed the bone from the bottom of the chicken breast .
very bland food , basically a take out place . they have beers listed on the menu board but they were out of drafts , out of modelo , and the corona was n't cold !
we placed our order around 730 and around 750 , the manager came by and explained that the order was never placed it would be placed right away and the meals would be on the house they also gave us a gift card .
the atmosphere of the shop can be kind of awkward because of the bad lighting and awkward silences .
i got chicken strips and potato wedges instead and unfortunately all i can taste is old oil . could n't taste the chicken at all .
started with martinis - awesome .
the place is nicely decorating and has a good lively ambiance .
great happy hour with cheap beer which was fantastic .
it was happy hour when we went , so selected cocktails ( my mojito ) was only 5 bucks .
even the price was reasonable considering the location .
perfect place to chill with no pressure .
the only negative thing i could come up with is the noise level . it is a fun place to be but the acoustics can make it a little hard to hear .
the food is very good , and i feel it is reasonably priced .
it 's also very affordable too so very good for those on a student budget !
i have to say it 's more of a kickback and chill kind of place .
my 5 stars are specifically for the quality of the food , the meal was phenomenal . amazing flavor and a very large portion .
i do n't know if they switched owners or what 's going on , but service was absolutely horrible today .
we went in on thanksgiving night and the hostess was rude and told us to wait for a table . the restaurant was n't even full .
the food is pretty good here and the prices are very reasonable .
the vibe was great and the drinks were satisfyingly strong .
no music playing , no one talking , somewhat uncomfortable feeling .
opportunity cost is too high .
we had delicious drinks from the bar ( i ordered the cucumber mojito ) , and the food was awesome !
the ambience is gorgeous and it is an open air environment with beautiful lighting .
price is about 10 cad per meal very reasonable for what you receive .
so all in all , really great food for relatively cheap prices .
the buffet is the same , the decor is beautiful , and makes you feel like you are in an palace with a beautiful garden .
pretty good , but i thought it was on the greasy side .
the prices are also very reasonable .
the homemade marinara was incredibly flavorful and i enjoyed the added touch of mushrooms and arugula .
very good meal for a reasonable price
ca n't wait to see this place rolling . good luck to you oma !
in conclusion , not only is their service sub-standard and their products mediocre , they feel no need to address their customers comments .
i also ordered a few house margaritas on the rocks but unfortunately only `` frozen '' margaritas were part of happy hour .
nice outdoor patio in the front .
if you happen to be seated facing that wall or your table is directly underneath that foul lighting ... .well it 's tremendously unpleasant .
what bar does n't have coors light ? did not have it in bottle or draft .
it 's pretty good , but also pretty expensive .
great experience and will definitely repeat . food and service were both top notch - special thanks to josie !
the margaritas were so weak i 'm not sure they even had tequila .
the edemame they provided had a great spice to them that made them unique .
the pinot noir wine offered is one of my favorite bottles ever .
that has no chicken .
all the curtains were down too which made it unnecessarily dark . mediocre .
as good as it gets for cheap eats . everything is cheap , delicious , and maybe somewhat healthy .
cool ambience , comfortable seating and good service .
the pineapple vodka drink was also great !
no margaritas . just beer and wine : -/ what 's a girl to do .
not that i drink beer but they have huge beer selection , over a 130 beers on tap .
the prices are pretty reasonable .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
super delicious ! to vibe and atmosphere is soothing .
i was given less than a pleasant response when i questioned them about it .
excellent food , service and wine list .
the macaroni and cheese was out of this world delicious .
try the grapefruit beer too , that was a delicious drink .
my salad was crisp and good but my sandwich was cold chopped up chicken , in which i do not like so i did not touch . my fault i should have asked if it was grilled chicken .
also , good selection of beer , 15 tap beers and about that many in a bottle .
so good for having such reasonable prices .
the service was fast and courteous .
many times i have walked away only spending $ 10 and that is with tip .
a great place for a drink and appetizer ( tapa ) or two .
right now they have a special lunch menu , there are 10 items and each is only $ 10 .
when she brought me the bowl i asked for it to go and she rolled her eyes , because putting a lid on is so hard .
did n't like it because the spicy glaze was rather sweet and salty and not spicy . the sauce was too complex and it ruined the wings .
we stopped in to look at their space and talk over some details , and decided to have a glass of wine while we were there . wines were on special , only $ 5 a glass .
they deliver and have carry out , but they also feature a beautiful dining room .
good thing this place is n't closer to my house .
what a cute little place .
i had a bubble tea alcohol drink and that was very good as well .
i enjoy live music and great customer service . and finally , i enjoy scrumptious food .
it seems like the lighting was a bit dim if i remember correctly , but the ambiance was a nice typical `` restaurant '' y feel .
the mint espresso drink ( the name is escaping me ) is also delicious .
i 'm a fan of dim lighting , but not so dim that the menu becomes impossible to read . it was also too loud to have a proper conversation .
the breakfast was out of this world , hospitality was amazing as vanessa my waitress at the front area ( bar area ) was very conversational , super friendly , very quick and attentive . the food came out super quick and was cooked perfectly .
they have a nice sized patio and a parking lot , the latter of which is a true rarity in this area .
i feel bad leaving the review that i am the stupid one that spent 2 hours and 40 plus minutes trying to eat sushi ... .
the décor is very nice and it is a fairly large space .
my girlfriends both got the pesto chicken pasta which they said it was bland .
$ 6.50 for two pretty good size tacos and a side of rice is a great lunch value in my book , especially in uptown and especially in epicenter .
the katsu i got was kind of dry and was a little salty , though the asparagus and veggies were pretty good .
overall great especially for the price .
omg ... love the sandwiches here the veggie is absolutely awesome , as well as the meatball .
the sushi is fresh and always good as well as the choice of sake .
do n't bother . the three draft beers our group tried were tasteless , even after we specified we prefer hoppy brews .
cash only , so put that plastic away .
but the bartenders were pretty poor at mixing a good margarita .
by far the best biscuits and fried chicken i 've had .
the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable .
potato salad was indeed really good .
i gave this one a three stars mostly because we ordered a pitcher or margarita and honestly i did not taste any tequila .
this place is amazing value , if you book online you can get it as low as $ 15 and night , we wound up paying $ 30 , but compared to the $ 500 alternatives , there is nothing to grumble about .
tiger shrimp tamale , chipotle glazed ribeye , roasted corn , and chocolate sticky toffee pudding were all very delicious !
price is honestly a bit hefty , but i think the experience is good enough to justify !
all drinks were ordered as `` lightly sweetened '' and all but one drink came out regular or super sweet .
the prices are higher than expected for the type of menu , but normal for vegas .
i did n't catch his name regardless its a poor way to handle someone willing to spend their money on this place .
the pricing is good .
it 's a very entertaining show as the water blasts out of cannon like fountains and make for some especially beautiful showings at night . very family friendly and with the water all around , a nice place to cool off on a hot vegas night .
btw , we told the waitress that we just wanted to let them know how the food had changed and what we liked about how it was before .
the server is friendly and nice . loving the ideal and decor .
the place has a homelike yet sophisticated atmosphere .
portion size for that $ 5.99 lunch special did n't satisfy me . i wish they had charge me $ 1 or $ 2 more and give me a decent portion .
my favorite is the shrimp and vegetables pho .
i highly suggest this place to everyone i know .
i took a look at the beer list and was pretty impressed , as they had at least fifteen different beers on tap , plus i think that they had a bottled beer list as well .
their iced tea is amazing ( the best i 've ever had , and i only drink iced tea and water 99 % of the time ) !
.. i would only go there for the drinks
good service , and great food , plus generous drinks at reasonable prices .
the only negative , if you need the restroom bring a flashlight the lighting is really dim .
unfortunately wo n't be returning or suggesting this place to any other fellow travellers . bitterly disappointed .
really great textures beet salad : refreshing and light loved it both times i 've been here .
great variety of meats and cheeses in the deli , after we ate our sandwiches and sampled some of the salad options ( i 'd highly recommend you try the broccoli salad and the macaroni salad ) we bought some fresh sliced pepperoni and mozzarella .
god , it 's so shockingly ugly inside here .
now it still is a special but only $ 0.75 cheaper than making your own combo so there really is n't an incentive to get it .
very good decent prices !
the prices are also very reasonable .
they also seemed to have a decent selection of wine and beer .
all in all , great place for steaks and catch up with friends !
the price here is ridiculous . probably because they are on the strip .
first impressions ; it looks pretty fancy inside , kinda shiny , and the waiters and waitresses use littler ipad things to take your order .
food was greasy and terrible .
draft beer was not as cold as it should be , order bottles . crappy music .
4. the entire place was out of all draft beer except some shitty orange something .
the salad was hilarious . and the rice was completely bland .
the prices are good .
the baklava was soggy and it was just a bad time .
i love the feeling of this place it 's cute and cozy !
even the margaritas were bad ( pre-mixed ) .
great food , and nice small place to chill out . not a large setting , but who needs a giant lobby to get some good grub !
the place is small , but it has a very intimate feel .
they had curtains between two rooms with random stuff everywhere . it was scary i felt like i was in a haunted house .
the drinks are a pricey but they have a nice beer selection and they make a great jalapeño moscow mule .
there are no decorations on the bland walls .
they still have the `` ingredients '' ... it really is fresh sushi here ... the blue fin tuna was so delicious !
sigh , full of creepy dudes and overall a bad experience . plus the dress code is racist .
my orange chicken was soggy and the king pow chicken was horrible with a horrible after taste .
i have a breakfast special # 2 and my mother had the chef salad both were prepared well and the salad was fresh .
service was great and prices reasonable .
great easter experience . everything we order was delicious , from the calamari to the salads to the ribeye and shrimp and grits .
it 's creepy and uncomfortable .
good selection of beer , wine ... not at all .
we started with the mushroom appetizer - deep fried and dipping sauce is horseradish flavored - very delicious !
came here with some girlfriends to grab late lunch and drinks after checking in to our hotel .
if you want a quick and cheap bite to eat this is the place on the strip . $ 1.59 chicken tacos and $ 2.99 for large fries .
courteous service . very reasonable prices ( $ 7-10 ) for lunch specials .
the food was really good . it was hot and i liked the dipping sauces .
i felt like the walls in this place needed a more color or something ... decor seemed to be pretty plain and did n't really go w/the vibe of the place .
the steaks were perfectly cooked and quite tasty .
wow is the serving staff on it here ! so extremely attentive its amazing .
it would have been more accurately described as breaded pork chop with watery sauce and giant whole caper berries and onions on top .
additionally , the draft beer was only slightly chilled .
ugh , so uncomfortable and an odd design with just 1 arm .
the dinner all you can eat is a great deal : 26 $ per person .
the staff is great .
fast forward it was overpriced and there was very lite sause and like no cheese on it . it was pathetic .
but the prices are great : you can get two complete dinners for $ 12 , which i suppose accounts for why this place stays in business .
fully stocked bar , they make a great orange mojito .
like what others said , prices are very good for old town and quality is good .
i 'm an mlife member and my bf and i just celebrated our anniversary and we decided to treat ourselves to a nice stay and because the last time we visited the resort for gambling and the shark reef aquarium we loved the atmosphere !
burgers were good , but nothing to write home about . fries had a weird seasoning .
: ) not worth $ 20 at all .
definitely try a virgin pina colada it is amazing .
my favorite server works extremely hard !
their salsas were really good , especially the hot one .
also a decent price as well .
it 's nicely decorated and it has ambiance for informal dining .
great food , great hospitality , great happy hour . excellent marg for only $ 3 ( happy hour ) made by keith .
full of flavor and spice and shrimp cooked perfect with a good portion of them .
everybody at this location is very friendly , and the lunch specials are really cheap at $ 10 each .
once we were seated it took the waitress a decent amount of time just to come and take our drink orders .
and prices super high .
it was a beautiful day and we got to enjoy a pitcher of sangria for $ 20 with our meal ... .the service was fast , bilingual and friendly .
i was over charged and the breadsticks i remembered being so yummy were hard , stale , and not edible . sadly disappointed !
love the martini i ordered .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
they have an outdoor area on the other side of the pool so it 's pretty lively .
nice tap lineup and a frequent rotation . looks like i 've found another place to add to my las list .
wine selection was fair as well .
service from the waitress would be rated as only average at best .
the food was cold and fries some were still frozen !
the flavor was awesome .
most of the time i get an entree and salad which are delicious .
great work guys . great staff .
no good beers on tap or bottle , so i ordered water .
they have a full bar , a nice draft list , and an array of bottled and canned beers .
the waitress was on the ball w keeping our waters full along and the huge bottles of saki coming .
i am usually only passing through but this week i had the opportunity to spend a couple of days in the area .
beers are only available by the bottle , oddly enough .
it 's massive and delicious .
this is also the best pad thai i 've ever had ! the spring rolls are amazing too !
very friendly staff and clean atmosphere .
my husband and friend 's boyfriend had beer ; the beer selection was pretty limited so if you do n't like negro modelo i would stick to a cocktail or wine .
she asked if i had placed an order for pickup , to which i confirmed .
weak drinks , there i said it .
i tried the pork , the chorizo , and the chicken .
the sauce is a bit bland .
the men 's room was disgusting and out of towels .
prices are very reasonable .
i would highly recommend the items prepared on the wood burning grill , the raspberry espuma oysters , and the cheese selection - yum !
the interior was very dull with pretty much no decor at all .
you only get 3 and they are half dollar sized .
think of the effect of having headphones one ; only the person effected by the sound notices how loud it is .
delivery is always more expensive and it was still under $ 80 to feed 6 adults .
cold noodles are great here . i also love the shrimp dumplings ; they 're bigger than the typical dim sum serving size and the shrimp is so fresh !
i also had a banana liqueur drink that was awesomely delicious , all in all a fine meal .
price is very good .
nice and engaging owner .
this is a great place to take friends and family , for casual or special occasions .
everything was impressive and the pakoras were the best i 'd ever had .
lots of conversations , cell phone and in person , filled the air , with nothing to absorb all of the sound .
atmosphere is pretty loud , so not appropriate for private conversations or romantic meals but perfect to grab a quick meal in a central location .
the menu is huge with many comfort and healthy options . they also have a huge variety of beer on tap .
this is horrible food .
the beer was good and cold , but i think i would rather have a draft house beer .
i was a bit disappointed that they did n't have draught beer but enjoyed the selection of cans and bottles .
our chef was slightly on the boring side , not bad but not good .
add a small fries , which should be enough for one person , and it 's only $ 11 for the meal .
both items were pretty decent in terms of flavour . however , the gyudon could have a bit more beef and onions as there was quite a bit of rice , and the udon noodles could have been a bit more al dente .
i 'm not fond of the mismatched furniture and the seats are painfully uncomfortable ( unless you get a booth ) .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
being out of riesling we were offered an additional tasting of our favorite of the six wines available .
i came here with my friends for a late lunch while we were in vegas .
i liked the vibe here .
the sashimi ( which is the true test of quality ) is fresh and lovely . they have a wide variety sushi and non-sushi options , and all have been impressive .
great food , huge portion sizes .
totally edible . but pretty bland .
no stars for the tired , drab & dusty interior .
even the margarita was bad .
it 's down this weird concrete hallway that make you feel like you might get jumped or raped in there .
of course we had various drinks on the happy hour menu as well .
great venue ! i travel on average every week so i visit nervous restaurants .
absolutely yummy ! service is usually speedy , and they have a nice outdoor dining area for the warmer months .
their wine list is excellent but i ca n't forget to mention their specialty cocktails either .
their pastas are awesome . atmosphere is chill with different sections : inside , patio or balcony each of them will give you different feeling of yorkville .
great place to stop if you 're in las vegas .
the atmosphere was great for chatting and relaxing .
i went on cinco de mayo weekend when hotels are generally very expensive and my weekend rate was only $ 80 per night , compared to lets say the flamingo which was charging $ 200+ .
expensive but good quality .
first , their delivery fee is more expensive than the listed price .
i will certainly visit centro again !
would 've given 5 stars if the service was n't so poor .
and the prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality - added bonus !
almost as if the refrigerator temp is n't cold enough , or has n't been refrigerated enough .
on a different note , the men 's bathroom was very messy and there was no soap or paper towels anywhere .
they were perfectly gooey and not too fried , eat them quickly though because they will get soggy .
service is unfriendly because the owner does n't ask the `` chef '' to nicely interact with customers unless he feels like it or has time to do so . he says the `` chef 's '' job in a traditional restaurant is to make quality food .
rudely cutting me off before i could finish my sentences , sometimes even making the wrong assumption where i was going with my question or comment .
the price is high it is more expensive than i thought it is a 20+ dollars place .
the patio is very nice .
lost of different beers on tap and even more in the bottle for you beer drinkers .
good wine list and a large menu .
and the strawberry margarita was very refreshing and tasty .
the $ 5 mimosa was poured strong and with pulp , just how i like it .
if you happen to be seated facing that wall or your table is directly underneath that foul lighting ... .well it 's tremendously unpleasant .
the food here is atrocious .
no acai taste and not cold , just tastes like a lukewarm banana purée .
ladies , careful when wearing heels ... the floor is slick , or maybe it 's how i walk .
the prices were ok. gets expensive fast !
the outdated bathroom that i always felt was dirty is all jazzed up with new tile , sink and fixtures etc .
three stars for clean store , nice color scheme , neutral service , and clean but unexciting food .
the piano player was simply wonderful , everyone enjoyed the music and he played off the guests which was awesome .
and , the lasagna was so salty that i could hardly finish my meal .
the girls had skinny margaritas that came in what looked like `` toy '' glasses and had hardly any tequila .
we got wine and beer , they have a good selection of drafts and bottles if you like beer .
my boyfriend took me here for a nice night out for dinner .
they smelled spoiled and one bite was more than enough to make me feel sick to my stomach .
did n't feel uncomfortable and parking was plentiful and good lighting .
there was also a good selection on tap , but there were no descriptions of the beers on tap , nor were there any prices for beer indicated on the menu .
as i was walking to the door , i could n't help but notice the extreme buildup of dust and black grime on the lighting fixtures and vents .
ginger cookies were really good , perfect sweetness .
it 's pretty inside at the bar .
the one thing i missed in the beer list was an indication of how many ounces they pour for the different beers .
this place rocks ! fresh sushi that is prepared beautiful and always tastes amazing .
beer choices were weak , wine choices were fine .
overall the food was boring when it was n't downright poor . i had a taste for a bratwurst but what i was served was an awful excuse .
my fish tacos ... .the meat was cold and tough , chewy .
the only problem is that there is no ac .
the prices are fair and reasonable .
it was prepared excellently , perfectly pink all the way through . it was delicious .
without the sauce it was pretty decent , and the added sauce made it that much better .
the drinks were great , and i was even adventurous and tried their `` something tasty '' drink and the mixologist hit the spot !
but the lady in the bathroom is creepy .
we paid $ 4.50 for a pepsi , and $ 15 for three 4 '' chicken skewers .
beer selection was horrible ( typical of canada ) and on top of that they were out of the one beer that 's barely drinkable . wine selection was nearly as bad .
they missed an opportunity to make a bad situation better .
only thing i did n't like about the room and the hallway was the decor .
we wanted something with `` chips and salsa '' and a decent beer selection .
blah . no one was mean and bottled beer is bottled beer but i might as well have stayed home .
they were a little behind in the kitchen with one of our orders and the chef came out to apologize .
sorry , there are way better options out there , never again .
there was a lot of unused space at the front , but some cool posters hung up on the walls .
service was horrible and they made it so complicated for my whole family to sit together even though there was an open table next to us .
not draft beer available , but lots of tequila selections , which my man was happy about .
loved the atmosphere ! the music was great !
great service , such friendly people and a very comfortable environment ! the food was amazing and very flexible if you are on a diet .
i 'm not gon na lie we drove by this place for like a month and was a little scared to stop since it 's a true off the road taco shop , figured if we ate there , last meal for sure .
their drinks are delicious and i would highly recommend the french 75. in fact , i had 3 of those that night ! my friend also got their mojito and asked for alcohol to be added in there and she loved it as well ( although it was extremely strong ) .
the lighting inside is very dim , to the point of almost using my cell phone light to read the menu .
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
easily had enough points for free wings , breakfast or a small bottle of liquor from the shop after about a half hour . we got the liquor .
went for wine wednesday because they have a killer happy hour !
their seats were so uncomfortable , seats that you 'd find at a hold in the wall place .
my favorite thing was the strawberry mimosa ... refreshing and strong .
for $ 15 this is a great deal .
had the garlic burger which was phenomenal . my niece had the fish and chips which she loved .
the decor was a little weird though . very colorful , but the themes do n't match up .
the inside of the church is beautiful but the ambience feels weird to me .
$ 6 to $ 8 would have been a reasonable price .
to top it all , the asahi pitcher and roasted green hot tea were perfect . a perfect meal .
the restaurant is nicely decorated with what appears to be hand painted murals on the walls .
reasonably priced and pretty good quality overalls .
$ 4 house wine was not bad .
i highly recommend the restaurant for a special night out .
yummy and filling ! chips and salsa are delicious , great extra spices and salsa has a good kick !
unfortunately , the room was less than desirable . the wallpaper was peeling off , the interior decor was so outdated .
i had the bbq chicken pizza and he had the ginger crusted tuna salad for main course and we shared the carrot cake .
it is done well with a delicious sauce and cooked just right .
this place is literally my new favorite .
decor : it 's so colourful ( not in a tacky `` ugly betty '' way ) i love it !
this not only presented a horrible smell but really , it could have been a potential risk to the restaurant should myself or someone in party happen to slip because of the water or towels .
the mens room had no paper towels and the women 's bathroom my wife said was so dirty with towels on the floor everywhere .
really nice staff and great service .
the bartender was making excellent drinks . the cocktails were unique and refreshing .
my favorite time to go is during happy hour and get pitchers of sangria .
they kept bringing a basket of sliced bread with a orange-colored butter that was exquisite to the tongue . then the main course of a chicken with fettucine was very well prepared .
the patio is the place to be when the weather 's right .
give me a wood chair , tacky thai paintings or sculptures any day , because i know i will be able to trust the food .
love una so naturally i enjoy their take out market .
beer selection through the roof . not a full bar though , just beer and wine .
i ordered the southside cocktail and it was so refreshing !
was here a few weeks ago and had a fabulous experience .
disappointing . beer was fine .
plus it 's probably just me but cold potatoes , when cut as huge as these were , are just kind of weird .
they paired easily to drink alongside the food .
not cheap , but nothing in calgary is cheap .
the cannoli was great for dessert .
i was not disappointed .
at least the server was decent .
we ordered bottled beers -- their beer selection is good , i will give them that .
this place is really popular .
we ordered two drinks , the sangria which was way too sweet and the specialty drink made with ginger beer and meyers rum .
they charge full price for my teenager , while those over 21 are able to get 6 bucks off with a players card ( free ) .
good prices and good service .
very friendly people too .
love the building , love the atmosphere , the decor is awesome and our waiter zach was pretty chill .
price 's are very reasonable .
food is reasonably priced for vegas and for a good restaurant .
sadly , some things were disappointing .
my dad introduced me to this little hole in the wall one day and i have to say it 's fantastic ! i did n't have one thing that i did n't enjoy .
side note , the bread was kinda tough and chewy ... but it was a welcome distraction to the rest of the sandwich .
it 's delicious and reasonably priced
the breakfast cost $ 7.99 and it is very economical considering it is vegas . overall , a great place to grab healthy and inexpensive meal !
also - delivery is only a $ 12 minimum , which is on the lower end of minimums for delivery .
food was amazing , wine and drinks were free flowing and the staff was great .
not a bad bar .
brandon helped make breakfast that much more awesome .
the food was very good , and reasonably priced .
no draft beer there but a nice cold bottle of corona .
i ordered a lychee water to go with my meal which was super refreshing .
i only gave the 2 stars because of the servers samantha and her co worker winter attempt to make things better they did what they could ... but charlie yuck not cool at all ... however me nor my family which it was a party of 16 will never return to this location ... by far the worst i ever had to deal with ...
especially when the cute girl in front ordered something on the side and he says `` i 'm supposed to charge you extra but i wo n't . ''
the bathroom was dirty , the garbage was overflowing , and the walls were all beat up .
we were there to celebrate my girls birthday so the entire staff signed a card wishing her a great birthday which was a nice detail .
this is one of the only places to sit and look at the lake in cleveland .
it 's totally faded .
she said this has become a new favorite breakfast spot for her !
they have a fantastic happy hour .
it all had a really weird taste to it too .
about the drink i 'm really wan na recommend lychee sage ( sweet and easy for drink ) also about service the restaurant is great .
this drink was the perfect combo of rum , tequila and pineapple juice !
the sweet potato chips were n't much better ; too greasy and stale .
i went in person about a month or so ago and the odor inside the store was overwhelming and smelled like bleach combined with something unidentifiable .
i find the place a bit over priced given the mediocre quality .
the food is really excellent and at a cheap price !
food and napkins on the floor , poor service and a general lack of care .
the service was great , very attentive .
there were other people in there but there was no music playing and everyone who was in there were talking but very quiet so it felt like a very intimate setting .
awesome service anytime i come by ! the staff is always friendly and on point .
the alligator theme is fun and the inside is really cute !
the wine selection was good too .
beautiful mysterious decor which i later understood the mysterious because it used to be a funeral parlor .
very tasty , a full of flavor ... simply delicious !
$ 14 for the sandwich and $ 6 for fries on the side is pretty ridiculous .
the bread was decent . the sub could have had a little more sauce , but it was n't dry .
it seemed really difficult to eat with the chips on top , and the avocado cream was not well incorporated into the dish .
normally i love adventuring and trying out new places and new foods when traveling , but i had n't gave the carne asada a shot yet .
i had a glass of the only cabernet i saw on the menu - it was also fantastic .
great beers , bartenders do n't know anything about the beers . the menu is ok. not bad to pair beer with .
i am only posting this in hopes they get the point and quit chasing people off .
i really enjoyed the ambiance it had a cozy but elegant feel .
they only had a few beers on tap , and none that were particularly exciting .
a little too dark , but nothing annoying .
they have tons of different options and tons of different types of food . service is very nice
we had the riesling wine , which was very good .
i have lived in the city of pittsburgh for over 2 years now and have been on the search for the best authentic mexican restaurant ... i finally found it !
the lamb was well marinated and the side salad very fresh and delicious .
good food . good prices
this is a very beautiful restaurant .
robert d was waiter tonight and he was so awesome ! he constantly checked on us and had great conversations , very helpful when it came to suggestions on the menu and overall awesome .
the lighting can be a little awkward when trying to read the menus , but impossible , it is not .
super fresh , not greasy ... so tasty .
the waffle was light and crisp but it was waaaaaay to sweet , i could n't finish the whole thing . i 'm kind of bum because the manager ( ? )
the menu has a lunch special and prices are affordable . place is small but very clean .
my children ordered chicken nuggets , they were burnt . my wife ordered a chicken sandwich and asked that the sauce be on the side .
our show was n't full and i was served most my food before i was even offered a drink even though i had asked twice for a beer .
i look around and the place is dimly lit ... not in a romantic way , mind you , but more in that , `` we just forgot to change the light bulbs '' depressing kind of way .
they wo n't seat you unless everyone is there so make sure you do n't have a super late person or you will just be standing at the front being very hungry .
love dinner here too keep it up : )
the balcony is a nice add on to the room .
i love this place .
so before he could greet us , i said to the others in my party `` we need to get moved to a different section '' .
i thought maybe it 's just me since there were only 3 tables seated when i arrived but i watched about 4 other groups go through the same awkward process of asking to be seated .
no draft beer - but they have a good bottle selection .
food was excellent and prices are reasonable .
comes out quick at a reasonable price .
the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars was because the waitress took longer than usual to get our drink order .
not great . really expensive ... there are half a dozen restaurants that do something better for cheaper .
prices are great ( $ 10-12 ) and coffee/tea are around $ 5 as well .
weird that the men 's one person bathroom has a big gap in the door .
the price is very reasonable & the drinks are very generous .
plus the lychee lemonade is amazing .
the food here is pretty average tasting for such an expensive price tag .
i believe it is too dense and so it makes it kind of dry on the inside .
we opted to take in the beautiful weather on a picnic table outside .
bathroom was pretty dirty , soap was out of dispenser and just thrown up on the sink .
i also love that you can bring your dog ( s ) and sit out on the patio .
the music is on point and play great variety !
i look around and the place is dimly lit ... not in a romantic way , mind you , but more in that , `` we just forgot to change the light bulbs '' depressing kind of way .
i was told they have a good selection of beers on tap .
i was happy to see a new fast casual mediterranean place open up .
i thought the tap list was great even though i did n't have a beer .
surprisingly inexpensive especially considering how great the food tasted .
i think they should cook the chicken in the pasta for more flavor .
huge and very open and modern new location man . come down cuz the staff is always so very friendly and helpful .
nice atmosphere and good food at fair prices .
i started with the lavender iced coffee , a bit strong on the floral notes , but otherwise quite good .
seeing the fish swim around is fascinating ( as well as a good distraction for the children ) .
this chain has excellent food but the worst service in vegas ! every time i think they might have gone through a management turn over i go back ( 5-6 months ) and they continue to disappoint with their extremely slow service , virtually no customer interaction , and horrible listening skills .
the prices are reasonable too !
salad is a great value here - $ 5 .
the food is decent and decently priced !
only thing i did n't like about the room and the hallway was the decor .
the price is very nice though .
after one was cold and bland i sampled the other , just in case . the 2 were virtually interchangeable .
we were told 'no , our bar is reserved for dining , it sounds silly but it 's our policy ' .
( as a player perk ) they showed me pictures of their room and it was amazing !
great service , awesome staff , will be returning .
great atmosphere , decent wine and cocktail list .
the layout is almost uncomfortable and haphazard in a neat and orderly way somehow .
all were dry , bland and tasteless .
my wife and daughter have been coming here for years and are so happy to see that they finally renovated from that classic 80 's look that was just getting tired looking .
also the prices are very reasonable .
the food is pretty good . the prices are average .
all the rest was vegetables . very disappointing .
the atmosphere is pretty chill , really low lit at night .
lets start with the crab cake ; too salty , taste wise it was ok not worth the money . the octopus was interesting , nice presentation , kinda tasted like a sausage but still not worth the money .
they were much fuller than my pork ones , but the chicken was so incredibly dry that they were not good at all .
at first i was skeptical about it but i loved it and going to drais is a must every time im in vegas .
this place is awesome !
prices are very reasonable .
for $ 37 this was quite a meal , but it would be just as tasty at full price .
there was live music and dancers which made the restaurant very lively . the tapas were all delicious and unique .
the people here are so nice and the food is so good . plus there so polite here .
i think three different people came over to help out , refill drinks , give us to go boxes , etc .
food was fair . seems over staffed .
they offer terrific food at affordable prices .
the selection of draft beers looked o.k . nothing outstanding but their bottle selection sucked .
unless you 're a party of 2 , it may be hard to just drop by and get seated quickly .
the egg rolls also came with lettuce , cilantro and mint that were very fresh and yummy .
for $ 19 i was extremely disappointed .
awesome place ! to start off the decor is so fun .
i always stay in the rush tower at the golden nugget ( which is fabulous ) when i am in vegas and going to vic and anthony 's is always an event .
excellent and friendly service .
ok sushi , super salty orange chicken , we sent the orange chicken back and complained about it .
the decor and excellent service is worth paying for though .
the price was very reasonable .
the menu was explained thoroughly , the drinks were yummy and not weak .
service was impeccable as always and the experience is always beautiful .
the portion size is pretty big so we shared .
we also love watching all the airplanes land and take off .
prices are also reasonable .
nice bottle of wine , four apps , four mains and coffee at a great price .
if you are unfortunate to have a sinfully long delay or worse , have your flight cancelled , you can w ( h ) ine about it with other like minded people at beaudevin with some awesome drinks and even better service .
unfortunately , they lack beer on tap but the do have a variety of bottles .
nice atmosphere- pleasant but not stuffy .
the girls had skinny margaritas that came in what looked like `` toy '' glasses and had hardly any tequila .
service was nice , just disorganized .
i also had a slice of traditional new york with sausage , pepperoni , mushroom and spinach ... it was delicious as well .
they also serve these amazing sundaes and drinks in martini glasses .
all of this and only $ 8 ?
the beer list was disappointing .
takes us to one side of the place where there are empty tables but no clean ones .
price is not expensive .
wo n't come back for mediocre ambience , and terrible service .
and for only $ 5 .
no cheap statues or posters hanging on the wall that are supposed to give you the hint you 're in another world .
not terrible . just needs improvement .
the setting is incredible and it is pretty romantic .
it was very bland and also disappointing .
they had a live band and it was so loud that i couldnt hear anything !
not bad but over priced for what you get .
skip those high maintenance places that want to charge you 10 bucks for an omelette .
i will say , the alcoholic slushies are good !
the price is very reasonable .
cozy atmosphere and friendly service too !
not to mention it was extremely difficult to find a clean table ... the place was filthy .
weak drinks , there i said it .
terrible they charge twice the price which you expect but the food quality and quite frankly the service sucks .
and one more thing i do n't like about this place , is their over the top religious decoration , fake flowers and flashing lights .
great good , great service , and low prices .
i ordered a chicken burrito bowl and it was stacked . i also got a side of guac which was yummy.. it actually was n't as salty as i wanted it to be .
the walls are not drab and filled with nazi signs screaming about fat is bad or banning butter .
kind of like the chef threw greens into a blender and then smeared the remains onto the plate .
then you should also be able to pick the bowling thing before 6 its $ 4.00 a game with $ 3.50 per shoes then after 6 its $ 30 plus the cost of shoes .
this is my favorite lunch place in pittsburgh . i recommend the tomato soup and hummus sandwich : - )
given the reasonable price and quality , it 's almost always inundated with people ( 3 ) , value : breakfast sandwiches for $ 3.99 and the other hot sandwiches for $ 5.99 - this place is a steal on the strip ( 5 ) .
we ordered 3 dinners for a total of $ 60.00 and it was not worth it at all . $ 7 for a order of plantains is ridiculously over priced along with the food not being up to par .
decently priced as well !
great food- excellent service- this place always has personable servers too .
so friendly and great service and food .
other then the other commercial establishment , so i purchased a groupon for farm basket , the reviews were great , but i received the worst fried chicken ever .
pretty good , quick and fairly cheap by vegas standards .
$ 16 for a burger , only worth about $ 8 , if that .
the beer selection was slim but what they had was good , nice craft beers but the beers we ordered were bottles so i 'm not sure what they had on tap .
the casino is great , the ambiance of the hotel is fantastic .
for $ 14 you can have a full meal .
i ate here visiting scottsdale and it was fantastic !
my mom and i went to eat there for lunch because she had gone here for breakfast the week before and loved it .
ordered dark chicken wrap and it was mostly rice . like over a cup of rice , with a few ver thin slivers of chicken and green pepper pieces .
we took 2 tables and we were n't hoping for a great experience but we were definitely wrong .
this place is delicious and definitely a great place to hit up when you are rushed for food .
to add insult to injury , the driver delivered the wrong pizza . when i called up to let them know i got a very tepid response .
the back patio is beautiful but the inside is decorated new orleans style and there is some really cool seating in there .
cheap ok wines by the glass .
for happy hour but because that does n't open til 5 ( we needed a drink at 4 ) we decided to try the martini .
that in of itself is not a bad thing really , and probably part of the charm , but its painted gray and looks depressing .
also , the dry noodles were quite salty .
price wise its not bad for the size of the sharwarma .
the only beer they had was budweiser .
they are pretty good but definitely over priced .
then we had about 3 different servers try to help .
it was dried and with the after taste of an old piece of chicken .
their drinks are definitely on the more expensive side ... expect to pay $ 6 for a latte .
drinks were average ... i had a couple skinny margs and they tasted pretty watered down , nothing special .
delicious food ! nice servers who offer quick and efficient service in such a busy place .
every visit something memorable happens ... this trip , we especially enjoyed the bartender who entertained us with great stories and lots of laughs while we waited to be seated .
the tomato soup was beautiful and silky .
wait time was about 30 min . waiter was attentive but got all the orders wrong and tried to compensate by giving us free tacos .
after waiting what seemed like an eternity , the manager finally came .
i 'm craving this right now .
1. spring rolls - nice and crispy and very tasty .
great food for a very fair price .
my family stopped in for the first time today and were really surprised in how dead the place was .
bud light and miller lite were not on tap , and i 'm certain that the bartender would tell anyone that ordered one to either drink a real beer or get the hell out .
unfortunately he was disappointed because the beer taps were frozen and they could n't pour and beers !
everyone is super friendly .
you could see behind the wallpaper .
decent food . reasonable prices .
and its priced right very economical .
it was a little more chewy and had more bounce to it . it was different and it tasted good .
the prices are incredibly reasonable for such a nice experience , with most entrees in the $ 15 to $ 25 range .
in total , for two people we spent $ 102 which was pretty steep considering this was supposed to be a casual night out .
exciting atmosphere , even a live band tonight !
the dumpling soup was delicious and the dumplings were perfectly cooked . the egg and seaweed were a nice touch to the soup .
sound just bounces off the hard walls and makes it very difficult to have a conversation .
we will never be returning to this place , unless they change their horrible service and mediocre food .
will have to give serious thought about returning to this restaurant after the absolutely horrible service we experienced .
we got there right at the end of happy hour and wifey ordered a glass of sangria , i had a glass of tempranillo ( that totally blew by the way ) .
a poor value . way overpriced for what you get .
it 's unfortunate but people need to read what to expect .
the bar is great , and so is the dining area .
the nigiri , though , just does n't taste as good as i think it could be .
beer comes with a free sake . staff are very attentive .
my drink was delicious !
beer selection was large however , so i 'm sure beer drinkers enjoy that . i do not really drink beer though .
however , as some people have said , the service is not the best and the decor looks pretty ghetto with extremely poor lighting .
the prices were also decent .
the fried rice was excellent !
i had the arab style beef and lamb shawarma and mom had the traditional beef and lamb shawarma .
their food is consistently good and the portions are very large , probably too large for most .
wait times whether eating in or taking out are about 10 minutes , which is very fair considering food quality .
he only start serving them when i asked . obviously forgotten us .
i do n't believe they offered enough for the $ $ . service was good .
the service was very fast and friendly !
i only had beer .
the side i had was mac and cheese which was bland and boring .
when we finished eating and drinking we looked around for the server and she was nowhere to be found . we waited and waited and waited and after a good 10 minutes she finally reappeared ( we had n't seen her the entire meal either so it had been quite a while since she checked on her table ) .
but he warned , i 'm pretty sure it 's basically margarita flavored beer .
was n't a huge fan of the spring roll ... would n't get it again as it did n't have much flavour beyond fried dough .
we tried the ski jump , which is hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps and frangelico , except they were out of frangelico so we had it with just peppermint .
boy ... it was almost like a school cafeteria with no privacy , extremely bright lights , and weird layout .
however , the prices are very high for the average product you receive .
the waitress was super helpful and nice , especially since it was our first time here and the menu takes a bit of explaining .
i tried my boyfriend 's dishes they were not bad .
not exactly cheap and not expensive per se .
7 pieces for $ 8 ... not bad .
prices are very reasonable .
geez ! i am pretty positive this is the right location .
great happy hour menu of food and libations .
off the strip fun , clean , hip great bbq establishment .
as an out of towner looking for a good meal and some play off football i was pleasantly surprised .
the drink menu is excellent and the prices are pretty good .
nice to sit on the patio .
wow . my wife had the salmon and popcorn and i knocked of the scallops .
salmon skin hand roll was blah , no flavor but the right amount of gobo .
or 2.5 it 's kind of confusing how the layout of the mall works out .
prices are very fair .
the essen haus is good for one thing - drinking heavily , getting really drunk and dancing your ass off to polka music from the live 3 piece polka band that 's there on weekends .
will bring our own sake cups for ambiance instead of drinking sake out of teacups .
it 's older and seems wore out . what drove me crazy was how thin the walls are , i could hear phone conversations , toilets flushing , and the guy snoring all night .
had the lunch special which includes a salad .
the food very good at a really reasonable price .
i also enjoyed a wonderful sangria .
friendly staff and cute little place for a quick bite . food was okay and service was quick .
definitely not world class cuisine , but tasty , hot , and plentiful .
not bad for price .
the menu choices are limited and the so are the alcoholic beverages . the beverage prices off the happy hour menu are out of sight .
glad they opened up in the neighbourhood !
the only suggestion i have is to get a host or a `` seat yourself '' sign .
only downside , they switched our beers at table , but all beer is good beer anyway .
i 've also ordered ravioli here ( i think it was pumpkin ) and it was good but i do n't think they have it on the menu anymore unfortunately .
i was n't a true fan of the harley davidson memorabilia scattered all about the entire walls but i can see how it can appeal to certain demographic , it just was n't for me but the television was distracting enough to hide away from the decorations .
not bad , but they could definitely add some taps or bring in some bottled beer .
very nice decor and exceptional service . highly recommend .
great place with excellent fish tacos , poutine , and of course , fish and chips . have had remarkably good service every time .
good food . fairly priced .
interesting place tacos were very good but small do n't let that cheap price fool you . very casual .
this place has a great vibe .
there is also an artful flower arrangement on the counter with birds of paradise , and a cooler with cold drinks off to the side .
my families new favorite bbq place . never had a bad meal here .
the dish was a bit overcooked and the ingredients dry , but you still got the gist .
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
the tacos are now $ 1.69 each , while 10 years ago it was only $ 0.99 each .
weak drinks , there i said it .
very tired buildings and decor ( some patches and repairs make you go , hmm ? )
my wife had a grilled chicken entree which looked tasty to the eye but the chicken was very dry and seemed like it was pre cooked and later microwaved .
the lighting is just absolutely horrific .
good experience with friend on a night out .
in summery , great food , good service , $ $ $ - $ $ $ $ , but- unless you want to bring earplugs to dinner , be sure to get a table in the birds nest !
we were immediately tempted with their bogo happy hour mojitos ... coconut , pineapple flavors .
i came here for the first time and this is my new taco shop the kindest people cooking up amazing food makes for an absolute pleasurable experience .
she assured me they would be added once the chefs find a good one to serve us .
this place is amazing , i ate there a couple weeks ago and was delighted .
not sure if it 's a new staff but before i ordered i was warned the kitchen was backed up . they 're were people complaining about having to wait and hope hour already .
the pizza was hot , the crust had a great crisp and nutty flavor .
that was the only thing barely pass .
i got a glass of some other kind of beer in a nasty glass .
very small little place , nice decor . very intimate .
the linguini bianco with shrimp was absolutely wonderful . sweet little restaurant with good service and great food .
good food for a reasonable price .
the server showed up to drop off the bill only after asking the front desk people if i could please get my bill and boxes to go .
the restaurant was very clean , but had those bright white fluorescent bulbs that do not make me want to stay somewhere for long .
happy hour here is one word : glorious ! the $ 5 wine and their gimlet make me smile .
they had about 15 beers on tap and they were pretty impressive .
i 'm sorry -- not everyone in vegas wants to drink at 10 am . that does n't make us cheap and you do n't need to be snotty about it .
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
the prices are reasonable too .
this is my new favorite spot to eat .
good times ! great music in the main bar and excellent patio ( kinda small ) with free pool or you can lounge around on the comfy sofas !
i would love to see them expand the space or add outdoor seating somehow .
loud ass hell , laughing off the top of their lungs , and just hanging out in large numbers blocking walkways .
wow , to compare my experience here this time and my last time in august is the difference between night and day .
it was great and piping hot ! the pizza was thin ( in a good way ) and everything was so fresh .
every item i tried , i loved , from the crispy eggplant to the buddha delight .
the service was great . the happy hour wine was very good .
the menu is very brief but very difficult to read with the lack of lights .
a & w 's decor is always so cozy and homey , the place is clean and really well designed . bar stools are pretty comfortable , and the restaurant is well lit .
it had a good variety .
staff is very nice and polite . overall , good experience .
although the place was about 80 % full , the wait staff still seemed surprised and ambivalent to see us come in .
the green beans on it were cooked just right and added a great crunch .
free shots and amazing drinks and food .
decor does n't really make sense with fancy chandeliers and bright green chairs but that 's not the worst thing about this place .
the total bill came to $ 200 , which i consider a bargain .
what bothered me about this interaction is that he insisted on having this conversation in the dining area where we 're seated which was very uncomfortable . all the while he was talking down to her and speaking to her in a demeaning way .
for $ 30+ a person i was expecting fairly decent food .
fast food arrival and brisk service . good go to place !
they appear to have a pretty big list of beer , but i do n't drink beer !
i am thoroughly impressed with this place .
even the margaritas were bad ( pre-mixed ) .
the food is relatively cheap and delicious !
shocked to see poor reviews !
unfortunately he was disappointed because the beer taps were frozen and they could n't pour and beers !
even the price is reasonable .
disappointing all around . beer was ho-hum .
funny because there was no one else around .
at no time did we give her a hard time or resist to pay .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
one of my friends got the cucumber margarita - delicious and refreshing , while i stuck to my favorite , the michelada , as i describe it , a `` bloody mary beer '' . yum !
this lunchtime visit was superb .
not crazy about the decor though .
they also have a full bar with plenty of specialty drinks .
unfortunately , they lack beer on tap but the do have a variety of bottles .
it 's fine dining at reasonable prices .
the prices are reasonable .
especially when you 're from asia ) usually , whole fried fish would cost min $ 50 if you are to order it at those chinese restaurants on the strip , but here , it was reasonably priced and i paid only $ 20 .
they kind of acted sarcastic towards me and like i was a bother . i know everybody has bad days though and the smoothie was n't half bad , but really , work on being personable and customer service .
but to pay 1.79 extra twice to get 6 pieces is sad .
very nice place for coffee if you are looking for a modern but hip spot .
for a first time visitor , the service was amazing ; everyone was very nice .
excellent service , fast & friendly .
prices are not cheap but they are reasonable .
service was good and friendly .
i drank the tasteless overpriced drink and switched to beer .
they only had 5 beers on tap , which i thought was sort of odd .
the worst thing is the bathrooms , they have run 2 four foot fluorescent lights on each side of the bathroom mirrors that are bright and obnoxious .
i took a look at the beer list and was pretty impressed , as they had at least fifteen different beers on tap , plus i think that they had a bottled beer list as well .
excellent wine list too .
and the bread was hot and fresh .
$ 9.00 with delivery fee for just a sandwich kind of sucks but it is what it is .
great prices on alcoholic drinks and food !
the aesthetics here are somewhat hard to describe , though the numerous yelp photos of the interior pretty much paint an accurate picture .
not sure who 's idea the ceiling was but that 's pretty cool .
tons of rice for the don and hardly any udon .
i was disappointed that they have no draft beers .
fresh veggies in a perfectly spicy sauce with lots of white meat chicken with perfectly cooked jasmine rice .
again , love the chewiness of the udon and if you do n't mind the tempura getting a little soggy in the soup ( or immediately put it on the side to avoid this ) , the soup is light and not overpowering .
the staffs are always always so attentive and nice that i never had a bad experience despite being here like every other week since they opened probably .
i ordered the szechuan chicken and it tasted great . it was a rather americanized version of the dish , but still really very good .
the food is pretty good for the price too .
only bottled beer , nothing on tap was a bit of a downer .
we are especially big fans of the butternut squash ravioli , the chicken was fantastic ... well i could list the whole menu , but the point is , you can not go wrong !
to top it all off , the prices are pretty good .
do n't bother with dollar margarita tuesdays . they 're so syrupy it 's impossible to drink an entire glass .
it 's the perfect sweet , summery ( and girly ) beer .
thank you for my burned , greasy chicken sandwich , absolutely inedible .
the only odd thing whew the extremely low chairs .
-1 : a bit annoying that they do n't have a bathroom inside .
and a tall glass of arnold palmer on hot vegas day !
the food was very disappointing now .
the only good thing about the experience was the bottle of wine .
the total expensive is $ 100 for two . considering we have 4 dishes and two deserts , it 's not expensive at all .
i liked that the bartender suggested getting a pitcher of beer instead of two pints because we 'd save money .
now this meal cost $ 14 which i find to be outrageous .
the pricing was pretty good too .
nice place and great experience . good for reading and studying .
i really love the new appetizers they have . the mini wedge salad is delicious .
i had sirloin and lobster and it was amazing !
most of us had wine flights and the selection of wine was very good .
sadly the mojito was better than the beer .
they had about 15 beers on tap and they were pretty impressive .
my only complaint was with the vodka drink that i ordered ; the albert 's collins .
it 's kind of depressing .
if you are tired of paying $ 18 a salad where you are paying for the ambiance more than your food , then this is the pace to try .
when they asked how we liked our dinner , i gave my straight opinion and the hostess offered to call the manager for me .
mike the bartender explained some different options an glad i went with his choices .
i also really like the atmosphere of this place . it is attractive inside and has probably the most comfortable seating of any restaurant i have eaten in for years .
our server was very quick to take our order , but unfortunately it took a while before everything came and when it did , the 2.25 $ additional price i paid for additional shrimp only netted me 3 more shrimp .
your drinks wo n't be more than $ 3-4 each and the food is honestly pretty good !
so allow some time to cool .
the bathroom walls sadly need a fresh coat of bright paint - the restaurant decor is fine but when you walk into the women 's washroom , you feel like you 've entered into some other grimy business .
breakdown : decor : nicely done , made me feel comfortable , `` warehouse chique '' i guess you could call it .
prices were also very reasonable .
the only thing to mention is the price - this is not everyday fare and will cost you accordingly if you do the whole nine yards .
the lighting was bright so i do know it was n't too dirty .
i also loved that they had fruit infused water in the lobby .
the only not great thing was the margarita which seemed over-priced with a poor pour of tequila .
they make incredible drinks .
my falafel sandwich was delicious ! it was fresh , satisfying , and well worth the price .
it seems pricey but when is healthy food cheap ?
i even once tried a pretty awesome jalapeno margarita but honestly i would rather drink the beer .
sat at the bar and had a corona light on draft ( bonus ! )
drinks were very good ( my wife could n't stop raving about their cucumber collins ) and very reasonably priced , especially during happy hour .
everyone was exceptional , funny and charming : a dashing maitre 'd , a handsome and truly helpful waiter , the chef was warm and happy to explain their signature chinese oven even though i 'm sure he has to do that a thousand times a night and the support staff ... wonderful .
the floor is n't the greatest , bathrooms ... let 's ignore those .
craft beers were about 5-6 which is n't too bad .
the make everything right to order so it does take quite awhile ... our group waited for about 30 minutes or so ... .
the selection of draft beers looked o.k . nothing outstanding but their bottle selection sucked .
great happy hour , everything is 50 % off and they have a great selection of martinis .
the only awkward part was the ambiance .
the salmon was very good , cooked perfect .
all in all it was an uncomfortable experience .
great neighborhood place to eat sushi ! their albacore nigiri is a must have .
in concept the idea seems classy . in practice it 's creepy .
worst service ever , and was stuck at the restaurant waiting for food to come for almost 4 hours . overall a terrible restaurant !
add the bottle of malbec we were sipping on and it was a great meal .
attractive , i know .
it was a pretty great margarita , as the sweet and tartness was well balanced in the drink .
the only real flaw it they should put padding on the ceiling or wall to suck up the loud noise from the plastered customers ..
the food was reasonably priced and tasty .
the ac was pretty loud though and the interior design looked a little out dated but it 's tolerable and not much of an eye sore .
my first review only gave two stars because of horrible service i received at the bar .
the price is right too .
the sauce tray of 4 different flavors compliments their food so well .
only issue was the lighting .
i found the decor slick and appealing , has kind of a velvet rope appeal without being too clubby feeling .
great food . great wine .
the drink menu is filled with tasty concoctions .
the drink selection was so lame .
not a tasty food , very bad service which they brought all appetizer and main course and drink together at the same time and the waiter said just sorry it was my fault but no compensation ! tables too close to each other , food no quality and no quantity wo n't go there again !
the bartender warned me that it was not a weak drink .
the waitress was loud and obnoxious screaming across the room as if it were a huge crowded restaurant .
great choice , as the bartenders were chatty & generous with the drinks .
we had an excellent lunch and enjoyed a glass of wine outside .
it looked like a pizza and tasted like a bad cheap pizza .
mediocre italian fare in a town with great options .
prices a bit high for the economy .
highly recommend to people from out of town .
it was cooked to my liking , but was very bland .
it had a cozy atmosphere with an inviting decor of dark wood walls .
yes , the interior is nice . yes , it has a downtown view .
not bad for drinks on a night when the windows are rolled open !
half of the things we ordered were cold too .
and they have some good beers for the pitcher not .
what a great find !
i felt totally distracted for some reason by the decor and ambiance .
the open window in the kitchen was pretty darn fun to peek through too !
my friend ordered a margarita from the happy hour selection and said it was excellent .
decor is super nice , and it 's worth the $ 9 lunch special .
so the bill for 2 salads , 2 steaks , 2 sides and a bottle of very average wine was $ 310 .
i would 've hoped they would 've had the foresight to put the crunchy pita `` croutons '' on the side.. but alas , total soggy disappointment .
they have a decent draft beer selection , and even more in bottles .
had nachos which were surprisingly meh . bar tap choice was kind of limited , and they did n't have all on tap .
i 'm not going for the $ 180 bottle of wine tonight , thanks ) . in the end she was able to produce two bottles of a nice chardonnay not on the menu .
my fiancé loves all their rolls that have to do with cream cheese , especially their baked lobster roll and their popcorn lobster roll .
the house margarita was n't bad either .
disappointed does n't even begin to describe it . hope they were just having a bad night .
sheesh tawook chicken is always a hit with the family as they can come in a wrap or alone to eat . their garlic sauce is a tasty one .
it 's right on the cusp between $ and $ $ .
it was perfect . my sons grilled cheese was wonderful .
beyond delicious ! my husband had the 2 if by sea with tennessee fries , which are amazingly flavored .
when we arrived for the reception we were led to a completely different room that must have only held 40 people considering we all had to squish together .
the staff at this location are always very friendly and quick to make things right if anything goes wrong .
reasonable prices for the quality of food .
i got the lobster and crab dip which was amazing and then for my entree i got the southern fried chicken which was absolutely delicious .
the owner or manager is super nice and most of the staff is pleasant .
good food . good prices .
- watermelon sangria - this was very nice !
we decided we did n't want to eat at a place with lousy service , filthy tables , and unruly patrons and walked out .
prices are not high , the cheapest beer in town .
i found it to be a little too loud ; the staff was already loud and they still turned up the music .
the food is fresh and they have a wide variety . the service is great and the prices are n't bad .
they have delicious appetizers and drinks .
worst service that was n't just attentive but not informative either . over charged us !
they had some great drinks on draft that tasted like beer .
nice selection of wine .
most expensive item is $ 22 .
take-out deep dish `` chicago-style '' pizza : crust not authentic , not buttery , crunchy and delicious like chicago 's pizza uno .
i 'm hoping this can remain a somewhat unknown neighborhood joint !
my only complaint is my friend ordered an iced coffee cocktail which was much too strong and just not very good .
especially an establishment that nickels and dimes buying cheap food and does n't look at the dollars they could be making by offering higher quality .
i felt uncomfortable every time he came to the table .
the pizzas at lamp are awesome ... thin , crispy , super fresh ingrediants , and they are made to order .
kind of looks trashy .
spicy patty - spice is suppose to amplify the existing flavour and since it was already bland it just tasted like pepper . not as dry .
our waiter bobby was attentive and polite and quite funny .
the food was pretty good , but seemed a little skimpy on the vegtables and meat .
i love coming here for lunch .
they had a decent draft selection and everyone said the margaritas were pretty good .
this is excellent and worth the trip alone !
not sure if we will give them another chance to take our money , or not .
it 's a cute irish pub with a dark ambiance and some great food .
the place is big , nice , well lit , and warm enough even at night in the winter .
however , i recommend to skip the fried rice here , nothing really special whatsoever .
we loved the food . the calamari was delicious and their antipasto salad was perfect .
i also had the peach soju during happy hour and it tasted great .
having said that their coffee was good so i did n't want to be a total jerk .
problem is , the food is nothing to get excited over .
not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses , that were more like scotch glasses , only knock .
i do n't know if the bartender is pouring half a bottle of bad tequila into those margaritas or their lime juice is off but it was just terrible .
the ambience on a sunny summer day was nice and relaxing .
the decor is pretty basic and they let people write on the walls .
they have a good tequila list though i was n't drinking tonight .
all were delicious and none tasted the same , all uniquely flavored and seasoned .
ca n't explain why but it seems very harsh and not homey despite the booths lining the walls of the place .
i 'm so glad we have rounders in our neighborhood .
this is n't tacky , it looks good .
food : started with the grilled wings , which were awesome .
expect to spend at least $ 150 for a decent dinner for two , excluding drinks , appetizers , and/or dessert .
prices are great too .
maybe when you do n't work for tips you do n't have to care about good service .
the interior struck me as dated and tired .
i think the food is good but it never comes hot . sometimes undercooked .
awesome view of the sin city . got ta say i 've only stayed on the terasse ...
we ordered a bottle of wine for $ 50 ( argentinian malbec - very light for a malbec ) , not too bad at all !
we do n't mind dropping $ $ $ for great food and quality , this place is an absolute rip off .
the thai tea is on point , the free appetizers are ridiculous ( i had the butternut squash vegetarian option ) and the yellow curry and pad thai totally made to perfection .
the prices are really good , and while the portions are slightly small , they are n't ridiculously so .
i 've tried one of their burgers- teriyaki and while the flavor was okay , the meat was just not good .
it 's kind of dark and depressing .
the grilled salmon over a creamy risotto was delicious .
i even once tried a pretty awesome jalapeno margarita but honestly i would rather drink the beer .
although , i did see a patio which may be open in the summer ? i 'm not sure .
typically a $ $ $ $ experience should be somewhat sexy , stylish and have good food .
been to many other smash locations in the valley and have n't been disappointed with one until now .
it was really good but the pizza was amazing !
the pork cutlet is perfectly cooked , crispy on the outside and perfectly juicy inside .
the drinks were good , especially the raspberry tea .
i loved the building and the atmosphere right away .
awesome to have chronic tacos in phoenix and this location knocks it out of the park .
the house margarita was n't bad either .
i love this place ! they have tasty affordable lunch specials for $ 5.99 .
the grilled veggies were n't bad .
one of the bathrooms didnt have mirrors which i dont like but were clean .
had a great happy hour in the bar .
a very good option for a healthy , vegetarian meal .
my only complaint was the $ 12 bellinis .
very good food for a reasonable price .
the miso soup was good , hot and tasted as i expected it to .
pretty frustrating all around .
pretty standard fare but it is reasonably priced and they get it to the table pretty darn quick .
the wine is absolutely fantastic . the food is amazing , especially the arancini , bellagio pasta and margherita pizza .
welcoming , friendly staff great pizza just like the one the east cost will be back for more . great lil place ; )
the food took a bit longer than expected with only one waiter working ( sunday brunch ) .
i like the upstairs patio is very nice .
not the best but not the worst .
they were quite dry and flavourless .
the punch was delightful and tasted like mango nectar ( dangerous , i could drink a dozen they were so good ) .
also , the interior reminds me of disneyland for some reason ... it 's disturbingly tacky .
they have a wonderful variety of breakfast foods at fantastic prices .
omg i love this place !
everything was flavorful and pretty large portions .
first of all , they only have beer and wine , no liquor .
amazing food and service ! went last thursday and brought in our own bottle of wine .
it is a loud and festive atmosphere .
ambience is amazing with the cave like theme with rock ceiling .
good drink menu as well .
loved this place on a thursday night .
i even called the day before since it was n't listed on the menu , the owner was very kind and promised me he would save me one .
reasonable selections of beer and wine .
my wife and i each had different wines by the glass and both hit the spot .
i got my beer and i ordered dos equis but they brought another kind , but beer was beer and need beer in me .
three huge pieces of meat which was awkward to eat .
he 's creepy , not classy , not sophisticated , and forced his way into our table 's conversation .
it was replaced with another draft beer that was n't that great either .
this place is real cool though .
great place to hang out in the summer !
very mediocre food and i bumped it down a star being that a hotel like this should know better . it 's an insult to compare this place to denny 's .
while during my stay i saw many attendants in this area , but not one time did i not smell musty old urine soaked floors , dirty tile walls and disgusting stall walls ... .gross !
cheap , decent food .
we received the bill and was charged for the rice ... my parents are very calm people and they do n't say anything , even when they are being taken advantage of ... and if they were n't there i would have said something .
the ambiance is pretty low key . prices are pretty good .
the prices are very reasonable .
reasonable pricing , maybe a little too expensive , but great food , good service , friendly staff
it 's a really cool bar to hang out with your friends and blow off steam from the workday .
it was ok beer was not that great tasting you ca n't even buy a small glass of beer without buying a flight .
filthy ! there is no reason a `` hole in the wall '' restaurant needs to be dirty ... the floors , the tables , the walls , the stained ceiling !
there 's animal heads on the wall but it does n't feel creepy .
the cocktail and wine list are great and the cocktails are on the side of a heavy pour .
as a top-rated spot in pgh i decided to finally give it a try .
food is excellent considering the prices .
expensive for what you get .
the food was mediocre for the price paid .
the spanish rice on the plate was cold to the touch and dry as a bone .
the service is top notch and super friendly no matter what time of night you go . great place !
the pattie itself was really meaty , but a little dry and bland .
unfortunately the decor is tacky and the whole place ( including the bathroom ) is cluttered by it .
there 's some ugly shit on the walls which made me wonder if i 'd like a hotel room better if the walls were bare .
made with vermicelli which unfortunately was not something i like .
games and and great place to relax .
we had a nice glass of wine with our meal , but the cocktails could use some help . the cocktail menu is very interesting , but the 2 we ordered were too sweet .
good food at reasonable prices .
drinks were made with cheap vodka .
nice atmosphere , we love the patio when the weather is nice outside . the fireplace in the winter .
i was not asked if i wanted a replacement and the manager who was in the room did not approach and say anything like `` i 'm sorry .
even the margarita was bad .
had a pitcher of very delicious sangria .
there was a paper thin piece of melted mozzarella - seriously , there was n't any .
we ordered the garlic knots ( truly addictive ) and onion rings ( huge and delicious ) to start and a chicago style pizza .
i stopped here only because the vietnam grill was closed for the night .
pricing is fair for what you get .
it was a warmer day and a corona sounded good , however , they had a decent craft beer selection and full bar .
the chicken breasts were cut in half ... horizontally .
i would love to say the decor is delightfully tacky , but it 's not . it 's just plain tacky .
the service and food is always good . although they make breads and sandwiches the serving size for the price is great .
not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses , that were more like scotch glasses , only knock .
the chica morada is a refreshing and delicious drink made from blue corn ( think horchata without the cinnamon ) .
my only complaint is charging 8 bucks just for the brat .
the prices were quite reasonable too .
the best part is that the bill was only $ 30 for 2 ramens , gyoza , and 2 beers.. far cheaper than we usually pay now that ramen is trendy !
there was a crude and lewd drawing hanging on the chandelier and there was not adequate towels linens or pillows .
great service . always fast and always friendly .
so in terms of decor it is grunge hipster - concrete floors that tile was removed from , plywood walls , crappy tables and uncomfortable chairs .
the takoyaki was all batter and soggy . the porkchop rice was very tough and has no flavor .
the prices are great .
he again flagged her down and the only response he recieved was that it was on its way .
the waitstaff were super attentive , the restaurant itself was lovely and the drinks ... oh , my , the mixed drinks . the must have beverage of the evening was the moscow mull served in a copper mug .
great selection of drinks .
very unique tasting shawarma that was fresh and quite large .
very sad the pay over $ 30 and get this food
first , we enjoyed a marguerite and a glass of the house chardonnay . both were good .
i had the spaghetti with mushrooms and it was very bland .
the prices can be shocking at times for some hard to find beers ( 20 $ + for a pint ) so make sure you check the price before you order .
in such an intimate -- but not totally cramped -- space , you can easily strike up a conversation with the owner/chef , hostess and any other staff .
the crispy beef was not crispy at all and very breaded and did not taste much different than the general tao chicken which is also nothing spectacular .
the mojitos were great .
what 's nice is they let you sample the wine before pouring a full glass .
it was not good .
$ 15 - $ 16 for a 10 to 12 inch pizza seems a bit steep but it is very good .
beer was good too and they even had drinks even if do n't drink beer .
it was a warmer day and a corona sounded good , however , they had a decent craft beer selection and full bar .
the bread served before dinner was amazing ! the server called it bread but it was delicious garlic knots .
the elixir tasted a bit watered down , but was overall a refreshing nice drink .
not a good place for wine , but about 30 draft beers .
good food at a reasonable price .
wine and beer sections is good , but not as cheap as a total wine , so pass on this section unless you want to pay $ 1 to $ 4 extra dollars for certain beers and wines .
we were one of only 3 tables in the entire dining room , and it still took us almost 3 hours to power through the meal .
the manager was nice and apologetic , but nothing was comp 'd and our meal with 2 drinks each cost about $ 75 , not including tip .
the shepherd 's pie is great ! all the food is good .
the rolls were mediocre . the temp of the rolls were an uncomfortable warm and the quality of the fish just did n't seem fresh .
the price is higher but the portions are ridiculous to match !
i could count all the noodles on one hand , only 2 pieces of chicken and 2 carrots . that 's it .
classy and soft music that took you away .
especially when you spend $ 25 including a tip and it 's different then last time .
my friends and i go here at least once a month and love the place . the food is always delicious and the service always excellent .
everything was so awesome , the view the atmosphere , the food is great ! it 's such a fun spot !
the prices are right too .
they did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it 's not all about crappy beer .
it 's pretty cool ( i know , weird to write a review about restrooms ) because it looks like a spaceship inside .
i do n't know if he knew how audible he was but it set for an uncomfortable setting knowing that perhaps your phone conversations etc are not very private knowing how thin the walls are ... .other than that the hotel does have a personable setting not being on the strip .
extremely dirty and the hot chocolate gives you diarrhea . wet floor and the bathroom has no toilet paper .
fantastic food , great beer selection ( and whiskey ) , great service .
to boot the food is cheap .
that 's price that 's hard to beat .
2.50 drinks and the food is super cheap , too .
some of them were sticky and some light dust stuck to them .
in concept the idea seems classy . in practice it 's creepy .
pizza is n't cheap but then again vegas is n't exactly cheap so be prepared to pay $ 5 a slice .
the beer selection was n't bad .
i drank the tasteless overpriced drink and switched to beer .
their pricing is good .
in the warm months , the patio here is outstanding with view of downtown cleveland !
that is fresh-tasting food at a very reasonable price .
it 's cute , that 's about it . the mismatch chairs with random decorations kind of puts me off .
there 's a glass blowing shop right next door which i think is awesome ! you can watch the blow glass through huge windows as you wait to be seated .
beers are only available by the bottle , oddly enough .
the staff were really nice and friendly .
i could never justify paying $ 4 for 1 empanada lol .
charged $ 5 , menu said $ 4 . no , it was not a happy hour menu .
great food , terrible service .
i ordered sushi and a glass of wine . delicious wine .
remaining competitive at a cost of quality is a very bad trade off .
i got ta say this place impressed me .
while we were talking the ( i assume ) manager approached and asked how our food was because he could we were not happy .
until i get a chance to sit down for a steak , i 'll continue to drink myself silly for happy hour everyday of the week
our server justin was excellent , friendly and efficient .
service was awesome as always .
cheap ok wines by the glass .
the descriptions given are pretty accurate , it is a really nice chill place with good music . the food was pretty good too .
the food can be pretty inexpensive .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
no alcohol this trip , but they do have a full bar , with 5 beers in tap .
the low-quality led pot lights give this place a depressing , cold atmosphere . it may seem unimportant , but it 's not : the lighting changes the look of the food , and that affects how we experience it .
the tempe location is far superior to the north scottsdale locale imo mostly because of the ambiance and the fact that the tempe locale is actually the brewery .
we sat in the nice open solarium area .
it 's so awkward and uncomfortable and all conversation is obliterated by the sound .
the food was good and reasonably priced .
always a great time when you go here !
the lighting was so bright i could n't stay .
the value was there too , good prices for happy hour .
delivery was quick but the food was completely bland and tasteless . ordered the general tso 's chicken and the sauce on the chicken tasted like watered down ketchup .
i would definitely recommend coming here if you 're ever in the area . great prices too !
the food was bland and basically tasteless . the quesadilla , which was listed under `` mex '' on the menu consisted of nothing more than cheese and chicken ( which cost $ 3.00 extra ) and was barely warm .
stopped here just for the strawberry lemonade slush during the happy hour time .
the servers were very polite and attentive . very nice experience and food was very flavorful .
food is good at fair prices .
i only had beer .
of course the drink selection is great , and they offer beer cocktails .
tucked away in a little row of shops in rocky river , tartine is a cozy dimly lit eatery .
you leave there with good food and at most a bill for about $ 50 a person even with a couple of cocktails .
bad with refills , bad with attending all customers , just bad .
but the owner was good to remake a new one based on our description for us .
they also did n't answer the phone nicely just `` hello '' sorry , but if you ca n't have good customer service , you ca n't have my business .
it was our first time there and i will definitely return especially on specials night .
did n't have any food , but the tea and shisha were great . i 'm not a big tea drinker , but i enjoyed the mint tea .
nice hotel very new and very hype scene .
they have a funky cocktail menu and the drinks were strong yet delicious .
not sure why they ca n't figure this out . just needlessly annoying .
it gets noisy in there , the patio is great but small .
the potstickers were a little well done and sauce was below average compared to other chinese places i 've tried . szechwan chicken is impressive to spell but not so impressive to taste , also below average flavor ... ... ... definitely nothing special about it is all i can say .
only thing to note is the dark lighting in some parts of the restaurant .
in all honesty the place does give off a `` hole in the wall '' feeling , and the really outdated decor does n't help .
i normally do n't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature .
the service is wonderful and the access and fresh air makes the location even better . it almost had the patio style vibe from inside the location .
all of the server 's are very nice and helpful .
the alcohol menu is a little small but $ 2.00 beers is also a steal to go with the cheap menu prices .
the hostesses ignored the issue for a couple minutes then finally came and sorted everything out .
the chicken len chili is our favorite .
i had read the crust was chewy and delicious . the crust was dry almost cracker like , disappointing .
we waited in line for maybe 30 minutes , which is n't so bad .
dark , with romantic lighting , the corner booths were great for a large party ( 12 people ) , and into the evening a stand up bass player with a pianist provided great mood music .
love the super friendly staff and awesome food here .
the tortillas were soggy and the cheese was nothing i had ever experienced .
once we told them that we did n't want any wine our service went from good to bad .
i had a chicken hilly steak and it was delicious .
alize is located on top of the palms hotel . when first entering the view is nice .
the cocktails are delicious and potent .
until today ... our waitress was horrible .
if you want to experience the beautiful building and calm atmosphere , give rosewater a try .
byob is nice , we can have a great meal without our bill doubling with a couple of drinks !
the server was horrible , but the manager should have seen what was going on .
the fresh juice blends were delightful , and the food is flavorful and filling .
we also had garlic naan that was super good too .
i ordered two slices , cost me $ 4.50 so cheap !
i tried the honey toast with strawberries , mango , whipped cream , and vanilla ice cream last night and it was amazing ! perfect level of sweetness and the bread was perfectly toasted on the outside while soft and delicious on the inside .
the restaurant has an absurdly tacky interior . a shame , really .
the food was good but probably not worth 70 $ for the steak or 40 $ for chicken .
the lighting was a little weird too .
our service was fair , she warmed up after a while .
the carne asada and shrimp were great , and the plantains cooked to pure perfection .
loved the atmosphere and the music was pleasant !
firstly , it has a great view of the caesars garden and fountain which is a huge plus . the decor is huge with towering ceilings and clocks along with pastel colors and a ton of pink .
it 's a decent place for people watching and in a convenient location close to many tourist attractions and union station .
the atmosphere is beautiful .
awesome happy hour . $ 4 house wines and well cocktails .
beer selection was decent but not many light beers were available . drink menu was impressive .
but the beer was disappointing .
no money at the cash register if you are paying cash and good luck finding a manager who can assist .
the staff is super friendly , courteous and thoughtful . the food is great !
i also love their broccoli & cheese soup .
the wine suggestion was splendid with my meal .
this is our go to place for steak and great food .
i drink americanos black normally and i was happy with it .
we started with the montford gin sour & they were soooo refreshing !
i eat from their library mall cart all the time -- always generous portions , always good . the lentils dish is delicious ; make sure you get sour cream on the side .
prices are very moderate .
i loved a drink i had .
wine list is nice , reasonable selection by the glass .
a high price to pay for two so/so meals .
the heirloom baby beets were fantastic and i highly recommend this dish .
love that they have the patio for the option of sitting outdoors , or staying inside away from the heat .
the drinks were amazing as well .
the interior looks not too bad .
mens bathroom apparently was a nightmare ( took away a star ) vomit in sink , urine and feces on floor : / womens bathroom was fine .
the gf only comes in medium , which for a 2 topping was about $ 17 .
they have a good wine selection and fancy cocktails .
the manager or supervisor never came over to make sure he was ok and not injured .
calimari appetiser was delicious .
high quality if slightly expensive drinks ( seems expensive for az but fairly priced for what you get ) and the menu can be overwhelming at first .
the manager said he could n't replace it without charging for it again because `` they made it right . ''
on top of that we thought they would come right away but it literally took them more than 10 minutes .
i normally do n't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature .
unfortunately there werent a lot of people there when i was there , but that doesnt necessarily have anything to do with the venue .
everything we tried was served fresh , hot , and tasted excellent .
place looks bigger than pictures and it feels very bright and open as you walk in .
i had the philly steak and it was very bland , my wife said the spaghetti was just ok , the highlight of the meal , besides the service , was the pickle fries if they were just not so greasy .
fantastic . the lamb was tasty and the sides were great .
amazing food and staff . kyle is amazing knows customers , runs his butt off to keep order at the bar and servers happy .
dinner rolls were cold stale and hard .
terrible service , and we were literally the only two people there .
the prices are cheap and the food is first rate .
i moved from cleveland hts to westlake two years ago , and have finally found a good chinese restaurant .
the owner ( young guy ) is very attentive and friendly with the service .
the fries were decent but not nearly as good as the fish .
$ 9 lunch meh.. a little expensive .
made with fresh crab meat , there are something different with their seasoning , it 's so good and it 's melt in my mouth . nice choice for dinner
the restaurant layout was totally weird but who really cares .
i 'm not sure how this place stays in business ? awful service , poorly managed , long wait ... the food is good but ... ugh !
it was cheap and good .
the bathroom was kind of dirty and there were n't any paper towels .
very pleased to see this addition to shopping in pickering , especially so close to home .
everything was reasonably priced .
drinks were fine and they had a good selection of beers on tap .
unfortunately , no bud light lime on tap so we just drank regular beer .
the batter was nice and crispy and you could taste that the oil was not old .
hardly any tequila in it .
we have eaten here many times and have loved it .
i really enjoy the sunday brunch . the omelets are very good and the scalloped potatoes are addicting .
i 've been here to watch sports events as well as to hang out with friends on the patio ; aunt chiladas is good for both !
not only for the patrons but for the servers as well .
the food is good , but the price should be equivalent to quality .
drinks are also pretty reasonable .
to top off , the staff recommended a mix of the sweet garlic soy and citrus ponzu .
they only had three flavors of beer and all of them were unknown to a beer drinker .
i just was ignored the whole time i was there . the two woman that were there were talking to eachother the whole time loud enough i could hear .
you pay $ 50 to get in and the only way to see the dj is to get a table .
jenny the server is amazing ! super sweet , funny and personable .
together with the dingy furniture and shabby decor , i was seriously worried about food poisoning . the service was pretty bad too .
i had the loaded potato soup it is ok it 's not too bad i still prefer paneras better .
wine selections are very good .
i do n't know if the main dining area is different , but the patio was extremely crowded and the tables were truly packed in .
it is an awesome spot to meet up with friends and family !
i highly recommend this place .
the drinks are creative and refreshing .
no atmosphere , poor lighting , so many things wrong .
the brisket was tender and full of flavor .
our experience was great .
only complaint is we wished they had beers on tap , though they had a decent bottle selection .
, but docked the restaurant a star for two reasons : 1. the lights are way too bright .
we were kind of ignored .
prices are reasonable and you get a good portion .
in the ladies toilets one was damaged and not in use , in both mens and ladies toilets they had huge wicker baskets to put your paper towels in , they looked stupid and tacky .
if your in vegas it 's a decent family friendly place .
it 's like a margarita , but with cucumber water , and absolutely delicious .
the place itself feels pretty upscale . i liked the décor .
we will never eat here again and strongly suggest anyone should n't either .
the decode makes one feel quite comfortable as well .
however , after looking at it , i didnt want to eat it anyway ... it was super oily and had some kind of gross bright purple mystery meat in it ( pork ?
this place is awful is like eating instant pho from the package . also meat come with the broken rice are tasteless and burnt .
the bleu brie grilled sandwich was creamy and crunchy and a perfect combination of flavors with the walnuts , apples , celery and cheese .
no need to be rude and shove your way around to get some grub .
management needs to help out the servers and clean up the tables and the floor the front of the house was a pig pen i was told the manager was working the kitchen .
they should reconsider the kind of sausage they bring in .
= ( it all sounds so good in theory , but i felt like the execution fell disappointingly short .
i love cartwright 's so we will give them another try and we had a wonderful experience at tonto b & g earlier in the day .
weak service , beer on tap was two things : warm and stale .
it was a bit underwhelming and the atmosphere was a bit awkward ( not sure what they are trying to accomplish with the offensively ostentatious purple neon lighting ) .
prices are reasonable , too .
yes some of the sauces , specially the kung pao are bland but the hot and sour soup , thankfully , does n't fall into that group . really a 2.5 raised to a 3 .
i have heard lots of good things about this place so i was pleasantly pleased when one opened up right next to me .
the lemonade was massive and super refreshing !
the prices were reasonable .
greatly prefer the steamed clams at pizza rock at green valley ranch , which comes with lots of focaccia .
we were disappointed given all the good comments .
very hard and thick and rubbery , hard to break into pieces and dry , could almost `` bounce it off the wall '' as my mother put it .
great food and reasonably priced .
after we were finally all settled at a table upstairs , we were sipping a couple of the tennessee peach cocktails and munching on some cheesesteak eggrolls .
we order from here at least once a week and they deliver ! consistently good and very friendly people work there .
however it is a cool place with lots of tv 's
what was even more appalling to me , was that the price for these scallops , albeit fair sized , was $ 14 .
decor does n't really make sense with fancy chandeliers and bright green chairs but that 's not the worst thing about this place .
great drink menu , too .
i waited for said seating only for that seating to be passed on to another couple , all that waiting for nothing and a broken promise . i made good on mine never to return .
the quality is just like some plates from food court , or even worst .
nice decor and ambiance . very lively .
they do n't serve hard alcohol but have beer and wine .
overpriced fried chicken ( $ 14 after tax ) that is too salty and with very thick coating ( thickest i 've ever seen ) .
they have a good selection of beer but the type of beer that we like was mostly in a bottle and not on tap .
the staff was really friendly but the food could not be justified for the price . was more like fast food but for $ 60 .
the seating is awkward - maybe it 's a cultural thing ?
the kitchen is clean as well and in full view . definitely a plus .
fry ( with 2 fry sauces -- very important ! the special fry sauce tastes like some kind of chipotle remoulade ... so delish ! )
let me list the ways : - tv low resolution and comes on at absurdly loud volume - confusing tv user interface - only one luggage stand - confusing directional sign when you get off elevator and are trying to find which long corridor to go down .
the lobby was clean , bathroom was pretty dark and no toilet paper so they definitely need to keep an eye on that .
the food is fresh and it was prepared perfectly .
a tiny hole in the wall . it 's a little expensive for what you get , but the fish tacos are fresh and pretty tasty .
very friendly staff and very good menudo i was looking for .
weak drinks , there i said it .
paneer pakora was delicious and the portion was huge .
the one weird thing about this place is the lighting .
could 've used more sauce , but it was good .
however , be careful because the prices add up : our two drinks plus a cheese board was almost $ 50 total .
it looks like they painted the walls , slapped some mismatched kirkland 's crap on the walls and called it a restaurant .
tried all the fruity drinks . great !
their spicy lentils are probably my favorite lentils ever , and their injera ( thin spongey bread , sort of like naan ) is absolutely perfect .
drinks - majorly expensive : ( shots $ 10 , glass of wines $ 10-11 ( but i guess that is normal ? )
it has a huge menu .
amazing wine by the glass list .
staff was pretty rude to boot . pass on it !
the bartender was talking to the only two people at the bar as i stood there waiting .
likely wo n't order here again .
maybe everything else tastes pretty good but that was disgusting .
no full bar , only beer .
relaxed , homey atmosphere and great service .
tip : try every sauce they have ! coconut guava marg is there for a good time but the diego is a complete classic , recommend the pitcher : )
since i 'm pregnant , the bartender made me a special non-alcoholic drink .
the pricing is a bit high .
for desserts , we ordered cheese cake ( the only food there that my husband said tasted `` very good '' ) and peanut butter and fudge creme brulee ( sugar on top but very different texture and taste from a typical creme brulee ) .
it was all really creepy .
the food is cheap , but really , really good .
we had to sit `` behind the curtain '' which made is seem like part of a conference room at a hotel , rather than nice restaurant .
a little ghetto , but smart .
honestly , the dipping stuff was awesome , i just had no idea what was in it we ordered calamari to start .
good food and awesome sunday night deal with the half off wine bottle ! thanks cj for being a great server !
nice space for a small group of people .
we sat at the bar enjoyed the perfect pour of guinness .
it 's very reasonably priced , and super cheap considering how good the food is , but the lineup is proof enough !
it was fragrant , light , and fantastic .
nice and meaty hot dog on a delicious toaster bun with bacon , green chili , thousand island dressing , and grilled onions .
disappointing . beer was fine .
why panera , this is extremely disappointing and not work a $ 12-15 dollar meal .
i do n't like having sloped walls or windows because it makes me feel claustrophobic .
and he proceeds to walk away ... we found that to be rude and unprofessional to tell your customer you feel it was a mistake to take that section .
yes , ambiance is cozy and intimate .
the service was amazing ! the manger made everyone happy and wonderful .
i enjoyed a few glasses of the rose wine and french dip on recommendations from the wonderful waiter .
the added mushroom and sauteed onions were bad and the dressing tasted weird .
biggest joke of the night was the glass of wine my wife ordered . wine was bad and the glass and pour were comical .
my friend got a sandwich that looked pretty good but pretty small for $ 9 and then a non-alcoholic drink for $ 5 and $ 15 seems a bit much for that too .
live music was good but made it impossible to really talk during dinner .
the empanadas are n't cheap , $ 3.50 each but they are delicious .
the unlimited beer/wine was nice , but there was only one craft beer on tap , which was disappointing .
i 'm happy i stopped in .
ambiance - a bit sad given the fluorescent lighting and location but i suppose you ca n't do much about it ¯\_ ( ツ ) _/¯
wonderful to enjoy a glass of wine or a great meal .
the tacos and corn are amazing . great flavors and fresh ingredients .
me and my girlfriend have become regulars here because we love it .
they had a good selection of bottled beers but nothing on tap .
typically i order the chicken gyro platter ( which is the shawarma version ) . their portion has always been good but today , i ordered the combo mix platter except i only wanted the chicken gyro and beef kabob and paid extra $ 2 for the beef kabob .
but , alas , i did not have much crunch on any bite .
a giant wall of window overlooking the entire city of las vegas .
there are no decorations on the bland walls .
yes the tortilla is fresh , yes i am sure the ingredients are all high quality and fresh as well .
she kindly advised me that would n't be an issue at all , instead of on a toast i was able to grab it as a wrap with no extra charge !
great visit . highly recommend .
can get any wine by the glass and a nice selection !
they have a full bar , a nice draft list , and an array of bottled and canned beers .
weird . the deep fried tofu app was also a bit of a failure .
go during happy hour . drinks are absolutely wonderful along w the food !
you pay sort of a premium but if the food is good , i will pay for it
the drinks are amazing .
the decor was a little weird though . very colorful , but the themes do n't match up .
but the 30 minute wait for a salad that took two minutes to prepare was not good .
the ambiance is pretty , dimly lit , and a little romantic , so it 's a good date spot or happy-hour spot with friends .
this is a casual small wisconsin themed restaurant .
only downside , they switched our beers at table , but all beer is good beer anyway .
there was a special on vodka , so i went to the bar and ordered a vodka on the rocks .
was pretty disappointed , dance floor was empty on a friday night , music was n't the greatest , though the staff at the bar were quite friendly and nice .
the prices are reasonable , especially for the portions .
the beer list was disappointing .
i asked for a hefeweizen but no ; they have 30 beers on tap including 6 different ipas , but not a hefeweizen in the house .
the menu is full of affordable staples .
my interactions with the staff has always been pleasant , and there is plenty of staff available to help with questions .
beer selection was horrible ( typical of canada ) and on top of that they were out of the one beer that 's barely drinkable . wine selection was nearly as bad .
just bland , regular pizza for expensive prices . only going if i get a gift card there because it 's too much for average quality .
walls are chipped up and needing attention and the lighting is just too bright .
1 ) i got the 5 spice eggplant which was good , just wished that it came hot , not cold .
from lovely patio to the live band playing the upton knows how to create a wonderful ambiance .
it 's annoying and distracting .
too expensive for average food and drinks .
other 3 times were dry , raw , cold vegetables with dry chicken and warm sauce over .
everything was reasonably price .
all the flavors look and sound delicious !
it is fairly pricey at $ 42 .
great food . reasonable prices .
the sides are good and not terribly overpriced at only $ 13.00 .
blah . no one was mean and bottled beer is bottled beer but i might as well have stayed home .
they need to change out some of their lightbulbs , as the dramatic lighting , despite being cool , was a bit sharp on the eye .
we 've always heard good things about yardbird and decided to visit during our trip .
beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor . or at least the menu was .
the ugly : some creepy looking customers in this place .
only bottled beer , nothing on tap was a bit of a downer .
the crab cake appetizer is amazing .
i was a bit disappointed that they did n't have draught beer but enjoyed the selection of cans and bottles .
i sure like the casual , funky vibe .
the food was still good , the only thing was the donut ( i think that 's what it 's called , the crispy deep fried batter looking thing ) was n't as crispy and was more saggy .
you can get full for $ 10 but do n't expect anything more than that .
enjoyed the 1/2 price bottles of wine on sunday 's for sure .
that pizza was one of the most delicious pizzas i have ever had in my life .
they also have a great wine and beer menu and appetizers .
the space itself was awesome !
amazing thin crust pizza and the best seafood risotto ever . also great deserts .
the smokey bacon , the sweet fig , the creamy melty manchego , and the mustardy bite of the arugula all worked so perfectly together .
my wife and i love this place . friendly staff , good service and always great food .
sorry to say this was really bad .
first time i came here i was super impressed .
beer selection was decent but not many light beers were available . drink menu was impressive .
the prices are great too .
they have great drink specials ; $ 1.50 mexican beer everyday , and $ 3.50 sex on the beaches on friday 's in particular , which in my opinion you ca n't go wrong with .
the interior was nice , like most places in vegas .
wash it down with some sangria and you 've got a great meal !
the place is attractive , but neither upscale nor particularly intimate though we required a flashlight to read the menus .
it 's a pretty cool set-up -- a converted house with a bar at the front and two nice back rooms with fantastic views of downtown cleveland that looked great at night ( all the skyscrapers were lit up ) .
the happy hour is a must .
when you factor in the astronomical prices , it becomes even worse .
the wine pairings were fantastic and it was so interesting to learn about each of them .
it 's a nice place to relax after work .
$ 12 for fries , burger , and drink is way too expensive .
excellent portions , well priced and everything is cooked to order .
the interior is cozy .
the owner is n't very nice , she 's not rude or anything , she just is n't very welcoming .
not many beers on tap , but what they had were pretty good .
nice , dim lighting . decor a little heavy on the taxidermy , but the decorator kept to her concept and constructed a coherent atmosphere .
the room itself was n't bad , but the bathroom could use some major renovation . it reminded me of a cheap motel layout .
the baked potato with 3 cheese butter is ridiculously amazing .
they have great drink specials and a brunch !
a lot of sand in the clams which was unpleasant and not good for the teeth .
nice decor , but unfortunately you can be subjected to listening to conversations of others , who do n't comprehend the theory of `` inside voice '' because of the seating arrangements .
however , our experience was quite poor .
their lunch special is two slices of pizza and a drink for $ 6 and change .
they offer a great variety of drinks - those seeking caffeine or not - teas and fruit drinks .
i also ordered the cucumber green drink that was really refreshing and delicious .
we were the only customers .
however , the prices are super reasonable .
but the service is always really good and the drink specials for happy hour is half price everything , if you can drink it its half price . the deals are pretty damn good .
i got and crown and diet coke ( which was ok ) and my `` date '' got the fireball whiskey lemonade ( which was really good ! )
the lighting was a little bright for dinner but nothing to complain about .
i liked the decor and the clientele .
if i 'm going to pay $ 25 for sushi i want a pleasant dining experience .
amazing concept , very chill , eclectic environment and the latte is life changing .
they are always so polite , the veggie bar is always stocked proper and it 's usually very clean : ) i 'm glad it 's right around the corner from my house cause i would take the drive to this one vs others in town .
the veggies are fresh and crisp , and the fish tastes high quality and delicious .
the high price basically compensates for the extraordinary service .
the selection of items on everything from cereal to tomato sauce was great as well .
you can get a decent meal for around $ 10 .
the indoor ambiance is beautiful .
the atmosphere is chic and i like how the sheer curtains give you a sense of privacy ( even though they do manage to fit a lot of people in ) .
in fact , it is worse than no service .
it has a great atmosphere . prices are cheap but food is great .
shots , beer all good but i did not their food .
the yuzu shandy was also quite delightful , even for a usually non beer drinker line me .
nice neighbor bar and grill .
wine was excellent too .
that was insane pricing .
sadly i did n't get a beer .
it took a really long time to get our food and when it arrived it was not hot .
we did order some margaritas and again they were n't bad just your typical margarita .
delicious food . decent prices .
all the prices are fairly cheap and food is so delicious .
the food is ok reasonable prices .
they were only good for light beer even thought they said any domestic beer .
for the price the pizza was really good . not my favorite pizza ever but was also $ 9 instead of the usual $ 15-20 .
no stars for the tired , drab & dusty interior .
prices are great as well .
there is private parking which is nice .
everything was priced very reasonably for what you get .
i got the chicken gyro and the wife got the falafel . both were excellent .
this restaurant has great beef samosas , and their chutney is great .
it was decent ... nice seasoning but nothing special .
awesome for a little bite but you might need to buy 2 slices ( $ 10 at least )
i enjoyed the sauce and tenderness of the veil .
however , i 've came here with just my boyfriend before and their food tasted way better . my boyfriend 's burger was juicier and my sandwich had life ( not dry ) .
sweet tea is on my top 3 list .
a screwdriver and chardonnay complimented the meal perfectly as did the service at the bar by peter ... a great lunch !
fair price and great atmosphere .
it was loaded with goodness and the flavor seemed perfect .
they had about 15 beers on tap and they were pretty impressive .
as for their main entree , i did n't think it was anything special ( i got a burger because i do n't like hot dogs ) .
the decor was kind of odd .
it 's a hip place to hang out with a nice patio , which i would totally sit on if the weather ever allowed it .
the prices are decent !
my friends and i enjoyed the cheap pitchers of pbr , the fried pickles , and they throughly enjoyed the pouch ( adult capri sun ) drinks they serve .
the staff is also very pleasant .
the only downside to the meal was that the portions were a bit small but at a price of $ 65 its pretty good .
good food prices too .
prices were reasonable too .
made the mistake of ordering a sparkling wine cocktail , which i 'm sure was good but just is n't my cup of tea .
the prices are very reasonable .
the prices were a little high for what you actually get but not outrageous or anything .
i 'm happy to keep the original location still exists !
not a gigantic portion but everything was hot and fresh and potatoes crisp and golden and wonderfully seasoned . everything just handmade and perfectly rich .
the staff are always super friendly and accommodating .
sausage was greasy though . men 's restroom was clean bit graffiti was scratched into mirror .
soo good . i always go here when i come to vegas .
but it is really cheap . it is cheap as hell .
there is a decent amount of seating inside and on the patio as well .
it 's beautiful and very cool -- a great hangout . u. south : you had me at `` bowling alley downstairs '' and `` awesome bathrooms . ''
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
a pretty decent breakfast - quick service at a reasonable price .
i loved the freshness of the homemade pasta and sauce . the meatballs were made from a very high-quality me as they were not greasy and were very light .
totally disgusted with her lack of sincerity nor any attempt of any kind of an apology , i started to leave and noticed another member of the staff engaging with an elderly woman with a walker who was obviously hard of hearing .
the atmosphere felt - crafted - artificial . the cocktails that are hand crafted by a mixologist ( and i had like three of them and tasted those of my companions ) were so-so .
the service is good and the atmosphere relaxing .
the prices are good too .
they also seemed to have a decent selection of wine and beer .
the golden pigs were recommended by the waiter but the pork filling was literally flavorless ; just a sort of gelled consistency surrounded by a fried dough that when dipped in the sweetened condensed milk ultimately tasted like a donut .
you can not possibly eat 37 dollars of salad .
they were $ 2 each , but a dozen was only $ 17 bucks . flautas looked good also for next time .
the restaurant is chic and lovely .
it was good . the house lo mein was a bit bland for our taste , but it was n't bad .
i know , that almost sounds good . but when biting parmesan cheese bread has the same texture as biting into a pair of wet kitchen sponges , there 's something unappetizing about that .
been wanting to try this restaurant ever since i moved to pittsburgh because i 've heard nothing but good things .
we 're not loaded by any means , but $ 50 seems like a fair deal to me for high end fare .
- although they only had three beers on tap , at least they were good craft beer choices .
it only costs 7-8 $ with a tip .
oh my goodness . bring your sweet tooth and your creativity to create the cinnamon bun combination of your dreams because these cinnamon buns are crazy good .
( just had the corn cakes and crab and it was awesome ! )
i love sitting upstairs especially in the winter time !
breakdown : decor : nicely done , made me feel comfortable , `` warehouse chique '' i guess you could call it .
great food . friendly staff .
the pizza is decent pizza , most of the time .
by far the brisket was the best of the bunch , even though everything was quite tasty .
fast , casual dining with tables outside in old town scottsdale for people watching and enjoying a great meal !
the crab is large , flavorful chunks which was great !
the price is not expensive , very reasonably .
apparently they only know how to pour beers and make margaritas .
i have stopped in twice since ncounter has opened in my neighborhood and enjoyed both experiences .
the staff is friendly and super nice .
the decor is cute and homey , the service has always been good .
they also have a good wine selection for all you wine lovers and connoisseurs .
prices were decent for portions -- most items are $ 12.95 and under .
the restaurant is quiet and dim , which was great after all the noise of the strip .
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
price is $ 15 , kinda steep . it 's good , but not that good .
prices are cheap and the portions are resonable , not generous .
we love to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful neighborhood .
the food smelled really bad too ... the meat was n't cooked right and the odor smelled like it was out all day . never again !
i was surprised at how nice and clean this place was . it was very nice .
room was dirty , lots of hair , drips on ceiling while showering , bathroom sink did not drain at all , noisy , carpet was stained , room smelled badly of smoke , not sure how it 's actually non smoking .
sorry , do n't feel comfortable giving 5 stars to a place with dirty floors and sinking ceilings .
wait staff is awesome , personable , warm and inviting . the food was great .
good selection of drinks and beer on tap but i was dissapointed they did n't have a drink menu so we had no idea what anything cost .
great happy hour . great beer and wine .
for lunch for 3 people at $ 85 , i certainly expect more . not good
plus , why are the prices so damn high ?
we believe that it would be courteous to at least offer us a time to return for table .
all the other staff was smiling and just gave a great vibe , most especially dan !
i was told they have a good selection of beers on tap .
there could n't have been more than three ounces of dried , tough pork butt on my plate .
most people hate complaining , why make them .
the price was $ 10 which is a good deal when compared to most restaurants for a salad of this high caliber .
however , no beer menu . weird .
however the price is not cheap 2 entrees and a appetizer can easily run ur bill up to bout 40 + tips and tax ur looking at around 50 at dinner time .
good selection of beer and helpful bartender . unfortunately , they 'd just tapped out 2 of the 3 beers we chose .
their margaritas were also especially notable , the fruit muddle is good but the mojito is just out of this world !
the lighting was totally off - it was way too bright .
the interior is very nice .
i was n't drinking but looked like a good beer selection .
what a nice surprise to find this little gem on the west side !
normally , i love this place but the last time i went it took forever for our food to come out and not only that , but the service was very rude as well . not sure what happened , but we wo n't be returning .
if i lived closer i would easily come here more often with the little one to pick up some lunch .
the food on the buffet was absolutely tasteless .
we ate 19 plates plus all the stuff we ordered and only spent like $ 70 .
super quick and friendly service .
our waiter was very friendly and helpful . the whiskey drink that he suggested ( it was something with strawberry and vanilla ) was fantastic .
the staff was very friendly at each place where we redeemed coupons .
i 'm a couple months late on posting this but my girlfriend and i took her parents here on mother 's day .
what a good value !
our waitress was really nice though it took a while to get seated and for someone to come and take our order .
been going during the week with live music . the food is good .
reasonably priced and service was quick . and nothing spectacular but solid .
gave 4 stars because the decor was too boring and lighting was too bright .
our food was good , i 'd definitely recommend the avocado tacos , they were sweet , light and delicious .
i checked in on yelp and got a free margarita which was also good and refreshing .
thank you so much for making my sister 's birthday such an awesome experience !
salad came with it and was very fresh .
the decor was straight out of sex and the city and , needless to say , outdated and tacky .
no complaints on not having a full glass of beer .
kind of gaudy ... stuck in the 1990 's .
the chicken katsu was so filling and big - i did n't think it was possible .
negatives - the only negative i can think of is the lighting is a bit dull and dated .
they only had sapporo on tap . there is a pretty nice selection of bottled beers but they 're terribly overpriced for a bottle .
that along with the blackberry tea was delicious .
always friendly faces , smiles , and impeccable service .
also the character of the 100+ year old house created both a charming and romantic atmosphere .
either prices have gone up , or i never paid attention , but $ 17 for a glass of wine is ridiculous .
it is quite small inside , but very cute and quaint .
i am sure that chopstix is great for college students who are seeking something late night to soak up all of the booze on a friday night .
we then had the escargot and the gnocchi with diablo sauce . both were great .
the server was great and the mango mojito i ordered was perfect ( although i admittedly know nothing about mojitos ) .
these servers looked dumpy and just bizarre styling !
the potatoes ( all varieties we had ) were tasty and memorable .
weak service , beer on tap was two things : warm and stale .
and it 's a great place to eat before or after a movie ( theatre right upstairs ) .
it was very weird service , and the lighting was terrible .
the drinks are good but i would n't pay almost $ 20 for a martini again .
sorry , 1st & last time i 'm here !
this place is delicious , and the guys and auntie working behind the counter were super nice . we 'll definitely be back when we 're in town .
it 's such a great healthy option and it 's very close to my gym .
chicken dish was dried out .
bed was comfortable . imo we had a neat view .
two things at sushi couture need to change asap : decor and lighting ( pot lights are so harsh ) .
the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and atmosphere .
i loved the layout : we were sitting at the bar in front of the kitchen .
all of their fried items seem to be over cooked and hard to eat .
this place is really cool and fun especially on the weekends . the food is pretty good too i would definitely go there on a happy hour are just with friends to hang out and watch the game .
the food was less than sub par . i found it greasy and extremely salty .
great sandwich and reasonably priced . good specials listed as well .
with thirty some craft beers and wines on tap , beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender .
the boys enjoyed some saki while jules and i went with iced green tea , which as really refreshing .
the lunch special here is cheap so that 's a plus .
but i have had bad experiences with the manager , very snippy and rude .
, and everything is pretty reasonably priced .
i 'm a little disappointed that the view of the lake is n't better , but maybe when the sun is out .
i recommend the chicken finger appetizer and mongolian beef .
it was generally very average , which is not what i pay $ 30 for .
, lousy service , loud , obnoxious singer who could n't carry a tune in a paper bag , way too dark , even with the stupid menu lights , ridiculously overpriced .
this restaurant is comfortable .
i was fully aware of what a foie gras was but i still did n't understand why you would insist on me consuming a $ 30 burger in your dining room with your loud tv blaring and the bright fluorescent lights .
the food was tasty and reasonably priced !
the bartender recommended it because of the vodka being rare and i enjoyed it .
love this place ! food is good , be prepared for loud , fun atmosphere .
the only thing i find annoying is the music a lil bit too loud .
the prices are very reasonable .
the staff genuinely like each other and are happy to be there .
chicken was super greasy and too much breading . fries were cold and soggy .
customizing your own pizza for one low price of $ 7.75 is unheard of , especially given the quality .
it 's a great place to go for a birthday .
food : the food is good , not amazing , but for $ 18 ( including tax and tip ) it is worth the visit .
highly recommend the honey garlic chicken appetizer ... .amazing .
the draft and bottle beer selection is legit , but mostly focused on regional selections which was disappointing .
our waitress , victoria , was great , pairing a perfect bottle of wine with our meals .
it was ok beer was not that great tasting you ca n't even buy a small glass of beer without buying a flight .
ok steaks , ... dirty restaurant ( very unsanitary ) . steaks were bland so pour on the seasoning before cooking your steak .
decent menu and prices .
quick lunchtime service makes this a great lunch hour destination .
not sure why the waits . to be fair i like the other locations just fine ... this one just seems to have stopped caring .
nothing was bad , but everything was disappointing .
the staff is superb , they go above and beyond for you and make your experience a pleasurable one .
i 'm glad that i gave mad greens another chance , especially since they 're so close to my house .
the server , who was not the person who brought my boyfriend 's food to the table , asked me if something was wrong with my food .
cafe is small but comfortable with great light .
the portions here are huge and delicious .
plus , they have a great happy hour and bar selection .
price value very good .
they still did n't have anything on draft but a good bottle selection .
the ambiance is very nice , it 's calm , you can enjoy your meal peacefully .
our favorite dishes were the lamb chops , empanadas , potato strings , roasted cremini and the dulce de leche crepe ! also the cocktails were spot on .
dark , dingy and dirty were the words that came to mind .
there was n't much difference in the soup bases unless you got something very different from the others , like cheesy milk hot soup .
they take that `` bottomless '' part very seriously , i think my glass was empty once the entire morning .
paint peeling off the walls , chips and discoloration in the floor , counters messed up , but the food is great .
the owners went out of their way to make us all feel like family ( we have 13 people total ) the food was delicious , coffee was to die for ( not to mention generous portions ) , and their ice tea was a refreshing unsweetened prickly pear ( soooo ... good ! )
being a server i would n't appreciate my guests sitting themselves out of rotation especially when i 'm not ready for another table but after an hour and forty minutes we had to take matters into our own hands .
it was very bland ( i 'm from the south so maybe you midwesterners like it like this ?
i 'm writing this from cafe novo 's free wifi , sitting on their bar which looks over high park .
in comparison to the other two locations this one would have to be my favorite - it 's more spacious and it 's got more of a romantic feel .
and for $ 11.50 plus tax/tip , you ca n't go wrong .
comes with bottomless wine pairing which was great .
we ordered the italian and the dagwood along with fries and amazing lemonade . everything was wonderful .
i would have been happy with them at a $ 12 buffet but not at 4x that price .
however , the beer was good . they poured a good beer .
it was amazing ! the hollandaise sauce on the benedict is to die for !
they have only a few beers on tap , a pretty good choice of bottled beer and a basic bar stock .
i especially enjoyed the potatoes and mushrooms .
and the price was great - about $ 10 for the entire pizza and a fountain drink .
we got wine and beer , they have a good selection of drafts and bottles if you like beer .
not many beers on tap , but what they had were pretty good .
great service and the rooms were clean . the downstairs was amazing minus the smoke smell on the casino floor but it 's vegas just get use to it .
i did but when i walk in and see a girl with a sleeveless see through top , i was pretty angry about the situation .
the place is darker then normal and i love that , gives it character .
it looked disgusting when i opened it .
i do n't know why my service was so poor , while everyone else seems to have a great time .
he asked our orders in a very rude manner , grabbed our plates without asking us wether we have finished or not ( and obviously we were not finished and there were plenty of foods still sitting in our plates ) .
nice variation of wine , beer and cocktails .
it was all really creepy .
she was absolutely rude , and terrible .
maybe our experience was an anomaly given all the great reviews .
i was surprised to find out that the cashew nut chicken does n't come with rice and it does not state on the menu that you need to order rice separately so now i 'm stuck with a dish and no rice .
it is awesome , fast and reasonably priced .
disappointing all around . beer was ho-hum .
broccoli salad was n't bad .
the price is decent but you get what you pay for !
beer was good too and they even had drinks even if do n't drink beer .
then the owner came out with lemoncello liquor shot that was delicious .
did n't feel uncomfortable and parking was plentiful and good lighting .
i feel the price is really more so for the stunning view of toronto and getting to experience the glass floor and observation deck . the service is excellent .
besides the lack of service and the rude staff , the food does n't merit the price .
the hand towels in the bathroom had stains on them , the water from the sink had a horrible smell , ugh .
have been looking for a good cheese steak since moving out here 5 years ago .
sure , but the flavour was lacking .
in concept the idea seems classy . in practice it 's creepy .
lipstick on teacup and spoon ... ... .the guy who took our order is rude .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
3 pieces of shrimp ( literally 3 pieces only ) is a $ 5 charge and 5 pieces is an $ 8 charge .
awesome cocktails broken down by alcohol preference .
i had a cucumber martini and it was amazing .
had a wonderful dinner here for my mother 's birthday .
the variety of flavors are unique also .
it was a tiny bit more bland than i am used to , but with jalapeño and lime it was perfect .
first of all , they only have beer and wine , no liquor .
the lobster mac and cheese balls are awesome as well .
the other annoying thing was the bright fluorescent lighting from the kitchen that shines directly in the eyes of half the patrons .
the burger was dry and had no taste !
finally , the interior lighting is a bit odd .
the staff is always nice and the place is clean . good food , clean place and friendly staff .
i ordered chicken fingers with their barbalo sauce and they were swimming in the tasteless sauce .
cheap prices . great food .
good prices , but careful no substitutes - a $ 4 breakfast will end up costing $ 7 .
the store front was clean but the bathroom was nasty - poop on the toilet seat and no soap in the dispenser .
the drinks are slightly expensive but they are delicious and priced for the strip .
the biscuits they served were way too dry , even with the bitter apple butter that came with them .
good food and fair prices .
$ 2 for a 16 oz fountain drink seems kind of steep too .
i would probably not order the sashimi tower again because it was just a mix of fish in a sweet mayo over a fried wonton .
it was only after i went to the front counter to follow up on my order did i get an eta on my food .
well the restaurant is very nice , but the bathroom disgusting , toilet paper all over the place , no air freshener .
other than that , this place is grimy , creepy , and nasty .
the chicken was a teriyaki katsu cutlet drenched in a thin translucent lemon sauce that you could easily make at home or buy at a teriyaki restaurant for a quarter of the price .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
good price for lunch .
all for a great price .
food did n't come out as asked , but deja ( our server ) kept a great attitude and handled the situation with grace . the manager grant did a fantastic job going above and beyond to get our order right .
prices are reasonable as well .
the prices for everything are good too .
drinks are extremely overpriced ( $ 8 for a 16oz pour or $ 16 for a cocktail ) and food is just ok although slightly more reasonable price wise .
i went in because it was highly recommended .
as for the service ... i do n't think the servers are necessarily rude , they just have n't been trained at all and have obviously never worked in a restaurant .
totally does not fit the vibe of the rest of the hotel ... ( see review )
i was ready to leave but i noticed there was only one waitress so we stayed to give her a chance .
now , onto the food ... i got the crab and corn soup , sounds amazing , but it was totally unimpressive with hardly any crab .
our waiter eventually showed up and said sorry for being tied up with two large parties .
prices are also reasonable .
i took a few pieces of chicken but did not finish it or take it to go as i was satisfied .
everything is so cheap .
love the decor and it makes for a nice break before or after the show to chat with your date .
the place was rather slow for a sunday night . despite this , the service was awful and slow !
everything was reasonable priced .
i love hot dogs , so when my friends who lived in charlotte suggested that they take me here , i was thrilled .
the lighting leading up is pretty poor as well .
it 's creepy and uncomfortable .
overall , food is great , hookah is whatever and the ambience of the cafe is horrible .
the place just seemed very old and the staff acted like they are doing you a favor and wo n't offer any assistance on their own .
great open airy modern space , great food , great time ! good for a date .
this place is popular !
this burger was just too hearty and rich for me !
from the patio , you get the prime seating for the fountains + you get to enjoy the beautiful evening weather .
she seemed surprised to have to put in an order for us she would put the order in but told us she would get our waiter .
this hit the spot and the help here is great .
it 's very upscale and the decor of the fire along the wall is very cool .
it was 45 bucks after tip , a bit pricy but food quality was great !
terrible food and service . will not return .
i also ordered a few house margaritas on the rocks but unfortunately only `` frozen '' margaritas were part of happy hour .
the service was attentive when it needed to be but the server seemed to be lost for periods of time .
i 've never experienced service so slow and sassy ... the staff are just plain rude .
happy hour prices reasonable for the strip and food was good .
the whisky smash cocktail was excellent . great wine list too .
once inside , the vibe is nice with dim-lit lighting and a reasonable ambiance .
the atmosphere of the shop can be kind of awkward because of the bad lighting and awkward silences .
great beer and great food but the best part is the outdoor patio ! the summertime is the best time to visit sprecher 's in madison .
they have a good beer selection but unfortunately the beers we ordered were flat .
trump is a nice hotel but 29 plus tax comes out to 33 bucks a day .
i had two beers and the beer was cold .
the first glace is cute , what girl does n't like hearts and bright colors ?
they use super fresh cuts of fish and not even the seaweed has that nasty typical sushi flavor .
the drinks are good quality not cheap stuff .
ok. maybe its me or i caught lolo 's on an off day or something but the chicken was average , be honest i 've made better chicken at home and i do n't cook chicken that often . seems like it was n't seasoned enough .
despite my reservations about their poor service , i attempted to order a pizza tonight .
wow , they are truly delicious .
no good . clean but weird decor .
if the weather is nice they have nice pub style seating on the sidewalk which is quite pleasant .
the drinks were strong which made them worth the price . the mojitos were excellent !
he may have been a nice guy at the beginning of our meal but the wait times and lack of apology did him in .
the interior is very dark though - my mom had to use the flashlight on her phone to read the menu .
they had a good selection of bottled beers but nothing on tap .
had nachos which were surprisingly meh . bar tap choice was kind of limited , and they did n't have all on tap .
everyone was super nice and professional and we felt welcome .
but this is a good place and i definitely recommend stopping in and checking it out .
the tamarind curry was my favorite although the egg noodle curry special was great as well !
the service was unbelievable even on mothers day super busy , management came over twice to ask if everything was good .
all in all , my friend and i had a fantastic experience at sweet esc and we will definitely be coming back !
we then were given ( at no charge ) a two free desert martinis which were heaven in a cup .
head waiter was rude & disrespectful about people standing .
however you 're better off getting the xl pizza for $ 10 as opposed to one slice for $ 3.50 . one slice for $ 3.50 ( that u need two to feel full ) vs. xl pizza to share with friends for $ 10 with about 8 slices
i 'm currently sitting in my booth enjoying my happy hour food & drinks ... .and i immediately felt this place deserves all 5 stars ! it 's my first time here and food was amazing and lucky for them i live around the corner and will most definitely be back sooner than later !
so my review is a little late , but i felt the need to write one because of the rude and unprofessional bartender i had the privilege to encounter at poros .
the servers are just unfriendly and seem angry at the world . not sure the food is worth putting up with the service anymore , saddens us .
broad noodles , tender beef and a few other tasty bits makes it a very satisfying dish on its own with bold flavour coming through each bite .
the prices could be a little cheaper , but the food is pretty darn good and the staff is friendly .
my one complaint was that the men 's bathroom was shockingly dirty and in serious need of repair .
either they just do n't know how to run their business or they are just flat out choosing to give horrible service .
they also pour the martini at the table and fill the glass which is definitely rare .
really great individual pizzas .
what once was dark and dingy is now open , airy , and elegant .
this is just a pub . if your expectation is decent prices alcohol and cheap appetizers this is legit .
very homey vibe , and the food is delicious .
$ 5 margaritas that are not great . menu is very small .
a bunch of us had cocktails with their vodkas and it was a super tasty !
great service and variety ! echo roll and brown rice rolls are must try !
the servers amazing . they pair the wine perfectly .
overpriced , slow service , cold overcooked food , gristly meat ... just a disappointing ... ... .hot mess .
prices are a bit high but no too bad .
the staff was horrible .
i 'd say for the price , it would get a 7.5/10 . the pizza seemed to be a little expensive for the amount and quality , coming out to ~ $ 23 after tip and tax for a large which feeds 2 hungry people modestly .
not sure why it has 3 dollar signs , it should be like one dollar sign as the prices are more than reasonable .
patio is dog friendly . i can bring my pups , listen to a great band and get work done .
he claimed that it was anything but fiery and did not finish eating the dish , stating that it had a funny flavor and had lots of granular seasoning on it .
great place to go in downtown las vegas .
i showed it to our server and she agreed that it did n't look right .
ca n't beat excellent food with cold beers for a cheap price !
and the prices are n't cheap .
this place has a serious price tag for what you get .
mango chicken is my favourite , plenty of chicken mixed with a great selection of mango and colourful veggies .
i love indian and mostly order chicken vindaloo because it 's my favorite which is what i got here .
a bit disappointing for the price .
combos are good and cheap .
the wife 's lunch was also very good . all the veggies and fruit was very fresh , and including raw cashews and unsweetened raisins really completed the meal .
do n't get me wrong , it 's a beautiful resort with several pools and hot tubs , lovely scenery , and good food .
the fried mac and cheese appetizer is the ultimate in comfort food .
only bottled beer , nothing on tap was a bit of a downer .
the staff is friendly and the bartender can make a pretty good martini .
i ordered a belgian waffle and it was rather hard and chewy .
the braised beef was not as tender as i was expecting , it was kinda dry to be honest .
server was rude and we waited thirty minutes just for them to tell us they were out of peanut butter . would give 0 stars if i could .
great flavors & home cooked style .
i love this place .
let 's start with the beer : i ordered a coors light which was very warm .
horrible service , no selection 2 hours before they close .
very reasonably priced , $ 21 for lunch .
do n't get me wrong ; the food was not terrible .
my best friend took me here for lunch one day and it instantly became my favorite place to eat when i just want something to take home or to eat lunch with a few friends . they 're always adding new things to the menu and the food they currently have are amazing options .
teharu is good for what you get . what you get is super cheap sushi at a super cheap price .
i got the special corned beef sandwich which was not good at all , cold caramelized onions and stale bread that was completely soggy in the middle when it came out .
when i got to the table it was disgusting , there were crumbled chips everywhere what seemed to be sticky residue was covered all along the edges of the table .
yes the view was gorgeous , yes the decor was elegant and pretty , and yes the food was delicious .
awesome food and great service the chicken manchurian is probably the best dish they have . these guys also have a great variety of soups and vegetarian dishes .
the mine that bird cocktail is strong but delicious i 'll be back
i opted to dine here rather than pay $ 35 to go up the cn tower because the prix fixe lunch is only $ 55 a person .
the interior struck me as dated and tired .
the quality of the food is delicious and the service is spectacular .
i was never a fan of chicken katsu until now but my favorite item is the furikake shrimp with the most unique dipping sauce .
the balsamic drizzle is delicious and the arugula works well .
very cool place to hang out
very nice food and drinks . very good wine selection and nice craft drinks too .
sorry but i 'm just being honest . as for the pizza itself is decent ( tends to have a bit of cornmeal but decent flavor ) i 'm just hungry side note , i heard 2 customers indicate the soda machine tasted like chemical ...
the place looks pretty tacky on the inside and decor is not my favorite .
additionally at a price tag of about $ 100 for a couple ( including only a couple drinks ) this place is not cheap , and there are far better tapas restaurants in charlotte .
the place is very clean .
our room is huge , but vacant -- there is little furniture to fill all the space , so instead of feeling luxurious like large hotel rooms usually do , it simply feels weirdly empty .
i get the whole car shop theme but it looks dirty and trashy .
overall , great experience with wonderful food and service . i definitely recommend coming here .
but the staff here seemed like they were trying to give me bad service .
bad attitude especially in front of a customer
nasty and weak margaritas that were being poured from a bucket . plain entrees .
it 's a nice little place to hang . but food and coffee are nothing too special .
great food ! the thai tea is delicious and i love how there is a $ 4 appetizer happy hour and bogo wine , beer , and sake .
the whiskey selection is decent too , and is modestly priced .
it looks good but all these hard surfaces make it noisy , with sound bouncing around all over .
great selection on the menu and reasonable prices .
if it was based just on food i 'd give them all 5 stars . but sadly the service has ruined our experience more than once .
to be honest though , the new seats did look nice and comfortable , though we chose to eat outside .
we were the only table over there for about 30 min .
while neither my husband or i drink beer , they look like they have a good selection of bottled and draft beers .
the bottled beer was n't as cold as we like it .
updating , since `` america '' went above and beyond to resolve my customer service issue of not receiving the 10 percent locals discount , i am happy to revise my rating . always good to see a business respond so positively regarding customer satisfaction .
the music choice was nice with a live singer that engaged the crowd .
started with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice ( $ 5 ) - it was in a decent sized glass cup so that was convincing .
a boat load of really bad bad food .
steaks always come out piping hot with the butter jumping off the plate .
update : ate here a few weeks ago and it was awesome !
the menu is very brief but very difficult to read with the lack of lights .
more expensive for dinner .
dried out and over cooked .
also had the pulpo enchilada , which was excellent with tender octopus , chilis and cheese .
they have a beautiful location minus the parking lot sitting between the patio and the lake . the drinks were good .
i was served one of the worst meals i 've ever ordered in a restaurant .
the only thing that really bugs me is the lighting . it gives me a funky feeling like things are dusty , and they might not be , but the tone of the lighting makes it seem that way .
the vegetarian dishes are delicious .
i have had the bbq burger , chicken pesto panini , the chicken caesar wrap and i keep trying different things every time i go in .
tons of hype , food and disappointment . jerk chicken was cold and soggy , ribs were flavorless mush and cornbread was hard as a rock .
never again , we ordered two meals plus a drink , we did not care for the drink the waitress very kindly offered to remove it from the bill . we got the bill it was still on there .
the variety of flavors and concoctions that these two ladies come up with are ridiculously good !
parts of the roll were rock hard and others were so dry that they crumbled .
the prices are very cheap and the food is fresh .
the view was the best i 've ever seen & had a very cool vibe .
do not pay full price .
the location , decor , and scenery is great .
the sandwiches are about 8 to 10 for normal sizes and you get what you pay for .
i 'm kind of shocked by the prices here 20+ dollars for a pizza is a bit expensive .
i could n't poor the rest in my glass since i only drank half and she continued to watch me poor asking me if i could hurry up and drink .
they have a great cocktail menu too !
i honestly felt a little sketched out by how dingy and dark the interior was at lunch .
this place was a pleasant surprise !
they were on the bland side .
it was reasonably priced and fresh .
the lighting makes it very unappetizing . the `` waiters ? ''
for $ 10.50 i expected a little more from the quality side , and i 'm willing to have a smaller plate for an increase in food quality .
alice f does get bonus points for atmosphere . the service is above average , there is lots of room for groups , and as previously mentioned the patio is pretty nice .
food was reasonably priced .
price is very reasonable ... compared to prices on the strip it is a real bargain .
you will have a great view of the fountains from the bellagio hotel across the street .
the only thing is , be prepared to spend upwards of 60-70 $ per person comprised of a drink , and a desert .
casey was very attentive and always kept our glasses full .
the ceiling has this unique writing on it - it 's like matte black and then someone spent unimaginable hours writing unique phrases all over the ceiling .
they have a great wine list and cocktails .
be forewarned , this is n't a place you go for a fancy donut experience , this is where you go to pick up a dozen delicious donuts to bring to work .
i love the strawberry lemonade as well .
my girlfriend highly recommended this restaurant .
the only issue is the guy taking phone orders . he 's so abrupt and ready to get off the phone you feel like you wo n't get your food if you do n't order properly , like the soup nazi .
chicken parm was still good but hard to screw up that .
the food was good and reasonably priced .
food is a deal for the price . tasty and great for those on a budget , especially their lunch deal .
my only complaint is that it was a little dry , and could have used more aioli .
also , their shrimp sauce is awesome .
for happy hour , the tacos here are a good price and decent quality .
the prices were super cheap too : )
i was surprised to see that the jambalaya had noodles instead of rice and even though our server raved on about how filing it was , it looked watery .
the one bright point ?
just to hang out on a summer day on the patio and have a beer is like ... the perfect day .
for $ 11 a meal the price seems high .
we are a big fan of getting three or five of their happy hour appetizers along with one of their rum flight s and sharing .
portion was good for the price you pay .
a mediocre letdown after finally getting around to trying this place !
the pour was horrible and the beer was flat .
for example , the guacamole is usually $ 8 , down to $ 4 at happy hour , and thus only a little over $ 1 per person if you come with two other friends .
extremely bad customer service .
not sure that was the kitchen 's problem or the servers ' , but if a customer has ordered the same thing 3 times and the servers never deliver that , the servers should at least notice something must be wrong .
our favorite place to go when in appleton .
we were patient and finally asked that if they were n't being made , we would just take the check and skip the other two .
not only did they hardly put any sauce on my husbands , i hardly got any meat and the meat i did have had like thick dry part on the outside and tasted funny ... i also was surprised to find a long piece of hair in the middle of my donair .
delicious food at a decent price .
the walls are not drab and filled with nazi signs screaming about fat is bad or banning butter .
we did n't try any cocktails , but the beer selection was n't too bad .
did n't feel uncomfortable and parking was plentiful and good lighting .
breakfasts are huge and about $ 13 , but they do n't mind two people sharing .
tasty . fair prices .
the churros with spicy chocolate sauce was boring and okay .
we ordered sangria margaritas , a cosmo , and a mojito and none of us were pleased .
ordered their drumsticks , do n't . they were chicken legs .
we each had a martini and they were ample and very good .
i called and complained about it she argued with me and said i have to ask for cream cheese i told her i in the hell am i suppose to know it come in beef or pork especially when you did n't ask .
not sure who came up with the whacked cocktail menu but fortunately they have a good selection of craft beer on tap .
once we were able to find our waitress , we told her these were the wrong entrees .
i do n't think our office will be going back there.the only really good thing was our server .
dishes that were `` cleaned '' had crusted food on them . it was n't just 1 dirty plate but 4 which discussed me and my relatives .
light beer , cider , wine , champagne , etc . )
plus the price is just right .
tequila selection was pretty good but the bartenders were clearly hired for other credentials than tequila knowledge , if you catch my drift .
the servers are always super friendly and attentive .
only complaint is that there seems to be a tendency for people to drag snow and water into the restaurant , and the interior was a bit too chilly for the winter weather .
we ordered a bottle of wine which was reasonably priced as well .
stopped by on a visit from out of town ; was really impressed !
prices were very reasonable also .
it 's got a weird vibe ... maybe because the decor is from another era but it 's kind of interesting , too ?
my only desire for this restaurant is to update the decor inside , and dust the wine racks .
for the price it 's really a good deal .
the drink that i had was a special vodka cocktail and it was amazing !
showed up on a fri. night and was told the wait would be about 20 mins , which was expected . what was unexpected was that they were holding a complimentary wine tasting in the java garden so i would have a free buzz going before even sitting down .
got to the store , the tables are dirty , people are everywhere , and the employee was ready to take my order .
was n't a lot of food for the money ... salad or soup was additional $ 3.49 . nice decor ... overpriced to me !
they were juicy and full of flavors .
the entire meal was worth the price . it was only $ 38 dollars and we had large portions .
hardly any tequila in it .
i liked the decor of the place with its picnic table seating and high ceilings , making it feel like you are on a ranch or barn somewhere . the country music also helped set the mood .
the thai-style iced tea is also a very neat , refreshing beverage .
i think my favorite part was that you have to lock up your cell phones and watches ( basically anything that might emit light or sound ) in a locker outside of the restrooms .
simple unbelievable . excellent beer and wine selection .
the decor was very unique and elegant - it really set the mood for the meal .
i enjoyed how you could not see the rest of the restaurant except through some patterned walls .
prices are very reasonable .
the next day the shower had no hot water for over an hour called the front desk several times and got no respond i had a show to go too and could only take a cold shower . the hot water was working when i return .
she said `` i told you i 'd be right with you but you could n't wait ! ''
i think there were only 3 or 4 beers offered , draft and bottled .
it 's very small , so you will need reservations as it is packed every night .
great for lunch or dinner or dessert with a delicious glass of wine .
unfortunately you could tell she was overwhelmed .
yes the pricing is a little higher than you would expect to pay in chinatown for similar food items but they do have some very good lunch specials in the $ 8 to $ 12 range .
i 'm sad i do n't live in this neighborhood or i would come here often .
the staff was excellent and very attentive .
so if you factor in another meal around $ 7.00 now you are at $ 21 for two people ... hardly what i would call $ .
the only negative is that i wish they had a larger selection of beer on tap . they had 7 beers on tap but they did have a huge selection of bottle beers .
their grilled cheese is fantastic !
they are super attentive to their customers and we had a great time ! definitely will be recommending this place to all my friends and family !
it is inexpensive but good food .
they also point out the `` suggested tip '' percentage on the receipt multiple times , which is pretty annoying because i 'm a server myself , and felt that it was kind of rude to show me over and over .
probably would n't pay full price for it though .
the cashier was very friendly and informative .
good dinner for a good price ! especially good value considering prices of places nearby .
the only thing that i found ( slightly ) bothersome was that the lighting was a little too dark .
they have an excellent beer selection and make a great grapefruit mule - although they need new copper mugs !
the food was amazing , the drinks were strong , and the service was fine ( aka busy ! )
i love the look of the space , kind of gritty , but with old church pews , very cool .
the good beer was n't on special at all , and their `` domestic '' beers were all pretty much the crap i wo n't drink .
my bf had the pulled pork which was also delicious .
checked in for new years weekend since it had a reasonable price .
the staff is super helpful and the food was great .
3.5 stars happy hour was awesome ! great deals , and my margarita was loaded with alcohol .
they are just like panda express , except the food is terrible including the salad bar .
they do have a full bar but no beer on tap .
price was reasonably $ 15 for the three items
i was willing to spend possibly 60 to 80 dollars worth of money to drinks and appetizers to this bar , but we decided to walk out with 12 dollars paid .
the only thing `` peanut '' about it was the fact that there were chopped peanuts in it . what about the thai peanut sauce ?
the crowd is lively , but urbane . the food is sophisticated , but completely accessible .
great vibe ; cozy and homey .
we shared a cheese plate as a table then i had the gorgonzola flatbread with a glass of pinot noir ... great food and drink !
did n't get a drink but looked like a nice selection of beers on tap .
now , the salad i loved .
some of my favorites are their wings ( i would suggest the sweet n ' bold gold ) , the steak & egg philly , and of course fries boardwalk style .
the price is reasonable , too .
i love this place .
great quality ingredients , cheap prices .
two specials only coast me about 14 bucks , what a deal .
$ 4 for a coke in a solo cup is lame , so we bought the 2l bottle for $ 6.50 .
kind of pricey but you get what you pay for .
the staff always takes amazing care of us .
so basically it costed $ 27.99 for the food and $ 5 for our soup base .
beer was good too and they even had drinks even if do n't drink beer .
the beer selection was slim but what they had was good , nice craft beers but the beers we ordered were bottles so i 'm not sure what they had on tap .
i thought it was decent .
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
garlic chicken was super tasty , though .
i have had better pizza from a box and certainly did n't pay $ 26 bucks for it .
way more avocado in the tataki than tuna but the grilled hamachi was grilled well and the sauce was super complimentary .
the only reason i 'm not giving 1 star is because the server was pleasant about it , but clearly not well trained .
i really had one of the worst meals ever .
poor experience in this place .
also the sangria was delicious .
the first time i went there this waitress was really nice . tonight i went there i experienced a racist waitress which was not nice .
yes it 's outdated ; there 's no tablecloths or fine china .
hubs and i love this place !
the pricing is high for mediocre food .
we finally tried this new place on the weekend and it was jammed packed but had a great vibe !
i highly recommend the meatballs , octopus and cheese bread for apps .
i read some of the bad reviews and do n't know why they had such a difference experience .
instead of the lemonades , he got a bloody mary and i got a mimosa in a stemless wine glass .
it 's a good restaurant just expect to pay a little more for just myself it was like $ 20 .
be sure to have a glass of sangiovese with your meal , yum yum .
i love flavourful food , so biting into an aussie pie ( i had the traditional ) which was lukewarm , bland , and incredibly overpriced was disappointing .
they have a really nice happy hour as well with discounts on apps and drinks .
do n't let the strip mall fool you -- this place is great and locals and tourists alike will be in for a pleasant surprise .
go hungry , the food is amazing and there is tons of it . make sure to get some smoked salmon and shrimp from the `` salad bar '' .
price is reasonable here .
beer and wine yes , hard booze no .
everything was perfectly cooked . all of the vegetables had the perfect amount of crunch to them and the meat was soft and tender .
there are also some swanky high top tables as well .
the red chili is nice and hot the meat is tender and flavorful .
sauces are very tasty and they can make it as hot as you want it .
prices are moderate and fair .
lots of great pork dishes and soups on the menu too .
what a great find !
they have some sofas for lounging and drinking , as well as tables for traditional eating .
the huevos rancheros sucked . very bland , nothing great at all .
i was able to get in , find my items , and check out in 15 minutes .
the burgers are just meh - not the freshest toppings , but not horrible either .
stopped in for a casual brunch/lunch .
it tastes completely bland and no flavor .
my husbands nachos were so cheesy , there was literally puddles of grease on the plate .
service was pleasant and so was the place .
not sure if it was an allergic reaction or an ingredient in one of their foods .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
great service , decor and ambience .
the pickle bar is a nice touch and the atmosphere is that of a sports bar .
they did n't have any beer on tap , only select few bottles which was disappointing .
it totally did n't go with the deco or theme .
if i were the manager i would have comped the entire meal happy bday sorry if we didnt meet up to your expectations and to ensure that my customers would return and give us another shot to impress i would give some kind of a coupon to make sure that happened .
then the table was sticky and the people behind us said the same thing but they said it 's the paint so idk i would say do a better job with that so people do n't think you have dirty tables .
very busy . pricey ... $ 14 for a margarita ... that wasnt the greatest .
one tray sat on the counter for about 10 minutes until they put it on a shelf behind them .
the place looks like a dive : across from a strip joint in a pretty industrial part of town .
to start off , the wine and cocktail selection was very good .
they have a full bar with beers on tap with no drink or beer menu ?
my eyes hurt with all the cheap florescent lighting in here .
the lighting is pathetic .
omg this is my new favorite place to pick up dinner to go .
the owners are very nice .
we ordered a bottle of their unfiltered sake which was placed in an ice bucket on the table to ensure that it was kept cool and their strawberry lemonade martini was to die for !
gorgeous dining room as well .
my hubby and i love to go here on date nights .
the food is pretty good and reasonably priced .
the view is beautiful and worth the trip up to the top floor of thehotel for the view alone .
the atmosphere was fantastic - a really nice quirky blend or old and new , and we were able to site outside which was nice .
ordered my usual shrimp with lobster ny style ( with added pork ) and chicken fried rice .
i love that they had live music during dinner .
me being a beer drinker they had a decent selection .
the hot and juicy was great . and all the appetizers on spot .
they have good drinks and happy hour specials as well .
but minus 2 stars for having a creepy guy in the bathroom .
we got up to leave and no one made any attempt to ask us what went wrong .
and only two bucks !
prices were relatively cheap .
it was way way way too loud inside the restaurant , hard to talk to each other over there ... lots of flies at the patio .
good food at reasonable prices .
but their biggest downfall are the microscopic portions at ridiculous prices .
: ) they make these big pretty fruity drinks too .
great selection of draft beer and although the food menu is limited , every dish we tried was beautifully presented and offered amazing flavour . enjoyed a lovely glass of orange wine .
the prices are good .
they do have alcoholic beverages available as well which was a pleasant surprise .
i do n't remember which draft beers i had , but i enjoyed them . looked like a good bottle selection as well .
spirits we 're incredible .
they have a cool outdoor patio and although it was too warm for the fireplace , it looked awesome !
such a cute little restaurant !
i was offended that the waiter did n't tell me how ridiculous this starter was when we ordered it .
nice casual ambiance ( patio ) , good food , good company .
the staff was attentive and very nice .
the crispy chicken buns are fantastic and a must for the appetizers .
my only real complaint is that i found it lacking in sesame flavor .
i know most beer drinkers prefer piss like corona and budweiser and heineken , but us beer snobs are kind of left in the cold it seemed .
found the vibe slightly pretentious .
also crab dishes excellent and we tried the tamarind steak -- very tender and sauce was excellent ( bye , not spicy ) .
they have a great drink menu as well .
the lighting was bad , very dark inside which felt weird while having breakfast .
the wing `` sauce '' is horrible my wings were dry and raw at the same time .
beer and margaritas available , not sure about any other alcohol .
this was a bad experience .
i am also a big fan of their sangria pitcher ( how could you go wrong with a pitcher of your favorite beverage ) .
i liked the counter setup and the seating . clean and comfortable .
gf had the chicken salad , she enjoyed it but we all agreed it was a bit of an overkill in arugula , she did n't finish it all as it was too much .
price is very reasonable .
was seated instantly and the staff was really nice and polite .
the $ 6 shots were exciting , new , and delicious !
they had a good selection of beers and something i 'd never seen before , jameson on tap . i 'm very curious as to how liquor on tap works ( and why a mexican restaurant had whiskey on tap instead of tequila ) but we did n't have the time to stay and investigate .
the moscow mule tasted like it came from a mix , and not enjoyable . the smores martini was delicious , and in the winter they have 12 dogs of christmas , served with a cinnamon sugar rim .
pasta is decent but flavours is pretty much just salt .
prices are a little ridiculous but that 's expected for vegas . the service is tremendous .
great price for the food you get - $ 7 for naan , a meat curry , a veggie curry , and naan .
fair prices , nice atmosphere , good service .
plus , the butter chicken was watered down and the rice was too sticky .
lost of different beers on tap and even more in the bottle for you beer drinkers .
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
great beers and food . staff is very observant and appreciative consistently waiting i customer .
i have never had a bad roll or piece of fish here .
also came with garlic fries which was a nice surprise and good .
it was not that busy ( 8 tables filled ) when we arrived but it took 5-7 minutes to be seated .
chicken breast was barely edible for how dry it was .
i can only assume customer relations is not one of their priorities .
bartender , as others have said here , was awesome- super friendly , happy to make recommendations , and just overall a good , pleasant guy .
the place serves familiar tex mex and also some delicious traditional fair . menu fav : fajita quesadilla
every other place in town , the bartenders introduce themselves and are actually nice .
we sat without attention , menus , or water for a good 10 minutes , and finally had to flag somebody down to ask for menus .
the flavor , texture , and presentation was superb .
i was very excited to try this new vegetarian spot when it finally opened in ndg .
the variety of beer and portion sizes are great , i really liked my salad , however the service is not .
food was ok but pretty bland . hot sauce was hot but really did n't have much flavor .
the food is pretty good and the beer prices are n't too high .
i did n't see one decent beer on tap or in the coolers .
i live a mile away and loved this place when it first opened , went on average once a week .
the local cider was great , and on a happy hour special .
in fact , they covered the entire plate ( see picture ) .
happy hour , check out the reverse happy hour its always popular . the champagne margarita is strong and taste great for a sweet drink .
good wine and beer list and dinner was very good .
maybe it was just ordering something that is not what i usually get at a thai place , but i was not overly impressed with my food .
special tip , the lemonade flavored sake is bomb !
it 's not cheap but it is definitely very good .
really spacious , kind service , and delicious bread pudding ! great irish music playing the whole time we were there .
there was a 20 minute line but was n't too bad .
it 's cheap and it 's good .
really good food at reasonable prices .
the layout is almost uncomfortable and haphazard in a neat and orderly way somehow .
the restaurant itself is kind of ... dingy .
the wine list is long and well curated for every taste and price point , the sommelier was happy to spend time with us in order to find a great bottle ( or several ) for our meal .
unfortunately all we got was a good bottle of wine .
great prices as well .
the meat quality is pretty good , and the price is very reasonable .
the rigatoni was unfortunately undercooked , which was rather baffling because the dish was n't even that complicated -- pasta , chicken , peas , and sauce .
one of the male bussers decided that it was okay to set their dirty bus tub on our table . i understand that it was probably heavy , but i do feel that was completely inappropriate , and a tad bit rude , and not to mention extremely unsanitary .
great food at good prices .
great food at affordable prices .
the bathroom was kind of dirty and there were n't any paper towels .
excellent dinner ! we had the chicken fried steak .
the lighting is dim and my pictures sucked so no photos : )
the taco was equivalent to jack in the box , the rice was no good and the burrito was just bland .
we started our meal with a glass of riesling - got ta love byob !
it 's hard to stress the incompetence of the management .
we sat on the outdoor patio and enjoyed delicious food , incredible weather and fantastic service !
outdoor seating limited but inside is nice as well .
service was very good and friendly .
real good food good prices .
nice man who runs the place .
very comfortable dining room . our waiter ( jose n. ) was attentive , friendly and terrific .
anyways nice hang out place with nice jumbo tvs .
great place to eat and relax , right on the water . it 's casual , but the food is good and it has a great view .
decent prices on beers and cocktails . great place for appetizers and drinks .
the portions are decent and prices are somewhat reasonable .
we spoke with the assistant manager about the poor service .
bad policy = bad service .
i loved them , as they were cooked perfectly .
price is reasonable as well .
toyama has two wonderful sushi chefs ( mo & giro ) who remember you by name and offer great `` off the menu '' selections if you request chefs choice . i highly recommend toyama for their great rolls and sushi .
bad idea ! margaritas were ok but not booze in them !
wonderful restaurant lovely restaurant , surrounded by picasso 's !
my mother got yogurt both times and it was fine ; again kind of hard to mess up .
yelp is riddled with customers who have had terrible interactions with you .
it is hard to get a better value for your $ $ $ , easy to find a more expensive place but hard to find the overall value .
it was decorated in a really cheesy asian theme , replete with a creepy floating baby head that gave me the willies because its eyes were following me .
service was friendly and pretty attentive .
they have some pretty good specials & it 's really not a bad place for a relaxing bar atmosphere .
as far as indian food goes in vegas , there are so many options . mint is perhaps my favorite for dinner because of the wide array of options at various spice levels .
the hummus was creamy and homemade . even the rice was noteworthy , fluffy and delicious .
there was no carrots , noodles , chicken or flavor .
too expensive for the poor quality of food .
the owner has absolutely no clue how to make customers happy .
i was tempted to just leave without my food but did not want to be rude .
beer and wine was unlimited , but they were serving only one type of beer .
great gyro 's and hummus . plus , really fast service .
full price of $ 25 was n't justified .
too expensive for a burger joint , i paid $ 100 with tip for 4 adults and 1 toddler .
their chicken teriyaki is a little lacking , though .
the men 's bathroom had piss all over the floor and smelled disgusting .
the appearance does not measure up to the tastelessness that you recieve . this sign was actually legit , $ 350 for a cheap bottle of vodka , insane !
the wine choices were excellent and they even had our favourite wine .
our bartender kept our wine glasses full and even gave us a free sampling to compare to the wine we were currently drinking .
menu options are varied , we had the chicken tenders .
the champagne and desserts were nice , but it honestly just felt way too expensive for $ 85 per person .
we used to go here frequently for good food - they had an especially delicious spinach ricotta pizza .
i would love to return but there are so many great places to try in this town .
the service was horrible .
the lights gave the place an uncomfortable feel .
my bfs burger was a little burnt so the taste was a bit off . however , he still thought it was pretty ok. fries were delicious and they give you a great portion .
as another couple tried to sit there the manager notified them that we were there first . i was glad he did that as he saved us from having to wait !
the decor is hipsterish in an unkempt way and bathrooms were atrocious ... .
the buffet was not good at all . the food was really bland .
for some reason i 'm not a big fan of the stained glass ceiling - it does weird things to the lighting and is distracting and i find it to be just the tiniest bit gaudy .
there are no decorations on the bland walls .
there 's only one person in the front taking all phone and in person orders .
server seemed rude , but i know it was just the language barrier as she would smile after what seemed like angry responses .
the entire restaurant was entirely unorganized , the staff had no idea what they were doing and it seemed like they could not handle their take-out orders with dine-in orders .
i have never given a bad review before ; the food was good , our server was nice .
the decor is outdated with very cushy booth seating but the service is quick and friendly .
it 's kind of awkward .
i will say that i really enjoyed my limoncello martini .
i highly recommend this resto . good job guys .
absolutely will never go back here again . terrible service & quality .
when i asked my server , lacy , to adjust the bill she gave me a nasty attitude .
the prices are very reasonable .
10 people , bill came to a total of about $ 110 not including soda for the kids or anything .
great place for a business lunch or dinner .
unfortunately , they have no beers .
the flavor of the dough was also nice .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
supposedly it had 3 different kinds of tequila , but i did n't even catch a buzz .
when asked how we enjoyed it , we replied that we did n't care for it and the waiter , emo , had no response .
i enjoyed the wine selection .
when it was confirmed by us at the cashier , it was looked at , and confirmed , only to be taken back and wrong .
nice seating and outdoor area as well .
the only thing i would add is that the service could be a bit better in regards to providing more attention to tables .
the plantains were alright , although all of the cheese and whatnot on top was somewhat unnecessary in my opinion .
a little bit more expensive than you might expect ( around $ 12-15 per person ) .
i had the duck fat fries and they were delicious - though they did taste a little burnt .
good food . reasonably priced .
the scallops is kind of sweet and on top of curry rice it 's kind of odd for us , and the seafood with pasta need improvement on the flavor too plain for us .
drinks were unique , tasty and strong .
reasonably price , with good service and decent food .
the dinner tasting menu with wine pairings is a great deal , as they give you a full pour with each course .
i found the decor slick and appealing , has kind of a velvet rope appeal without being too clubby feeling .
i was shocked . asked if she thought i was lying .
they were $ 6 each . it was decent..
we got their tartare sauce , and it was a great pair .
we ordered some coffees and inquired about re-fills , the guy behind the counter was rude and asked me if i knew of any places that served re-fills , i said across the street , i guess they thought i was a tourist or something but i 'm not coming here again .
the server was a little sketchy and the decor a little frightening ( creepy fat people paintings ... weird ! ) but overall it was n't an unpleasant experience .
i love this place .
they have awesome dessert martinis and spiked hot beverages and milkshakes as well .
i also liked the layout of the place and the dark color scheme .
i 've been to this establishment 8+ times and i have yet to have good service .
yup yup you read right , the theme of the entire restaurant changes .
when it arrived it was just as tough and poorly cooked . it was rare .
another bummer was that they only service wine and beer , but lacked a strong list of either .
their patio facing the golf course is absolutely gorgeous .
the prices were very reasonable .
the food is great and very fairly priced .
they 're pretty tasty and superbly cheap .
the prices are 20 % higher than the already high prices in the u.s. the food was a huge disappointment . small portions for the price and terrible food .
the staff is amazing and and very attentive .
unfortunately , the room was less than desirable . the wallpaper was peeling off , the interior decor was so outdated .
they have 3 tea selections and it was refreshing for the warm day .
14 $ & 12 $ bucks thats about as cheap as you can get for a meal here other entree 's are 18-25 $ .
this place place is pretty good and very reasonably priced .
good wine list , great service .
we ordered a handful of beers and some cocktails ... ..they were n't cheap , but not obnoxiously overpriced either .
we had no running water for two nights and then we had no hot water .
great job to matt 's crew members
the flavoring was bland .
service was good . but really the food was tasteless and not appealing .
not a bad bar .
anyways i see many people ordering the dumplings too . side dishes are so good some time i give up ordering cold noodle just to get the full side dishes ( only ordering cold noodle has limited side dishes ) .
they have great cocktails too .
prices are a little more expensive than i expected .
the place is really quite and peaceful . also really pretty !
also , reasonable prices !
they have a lot of beers on tap but i got a weird look when i asked for a beer list .
stuffed mushrooms , shrimp alfredo and the chocolate stuffed cookie were my favorite . service was excellent too .
this place is horrible .
way too loud and you have to yell at your dinner mates .
it was not terrible but it was very different .
it had a ton of cheese including ricotta . and each bite had a nice hint of garlic .
the beer i got ( which was the cheapest on tap besides miller lite ) was not bad .
when i say drinks i mean sodas - no special bar drink or something .
the view at night is breathtaking ! i love that you can see the entire las vegas strip while you dine .
their pricing is pretty cheap , considering the awesome seafood options on their menu .
the sweet pork tasted good but again , was n't anything too impressive .
carmon 's is a dingy little restaurant that has cute `` authentic '' touches here and there - fans that look like jet engines , mismatched salt and pepper sets , crappy paper menus shoved onto a clipboard , an antique cash register - but their menu lacks a certain something .
the restaurant is beautiful , surrounded with windows and adorned with fresh colorful flowers .
if you 're looking for a restaurant that has ambience , music , nice lighting and gives you a feeling of being welcomed , do n't come here .
it tasted normal , good choice .
it was pretty distracting ... who does n't like cartoons !
i only gave 3 stars because the service was horrible .
it was just surprising that the rest of the place was cleaned up pretty well , but the bathroom ( cool artwork aside ) was kinda gross .
the decor was neat . i liked the dollar bills on the walls , though this might be a turnoff for some .
looks like a hole in the wall but it 's pretty good . good service , good food , good prices .
our server was nice , attentive and efficient .
not a huge fan of frosty glasses for craft beer , but it was n't so bad that there was an iceberg floating in my beer or anything .
the interior is very posh ( its in the world furniture market , so it has to be nicely decorated ) .
supposedly it had 3 different kinds of tequila , but i did n't even catch a buzz .
prices here are very fair .
the prices for drinks are reasonable for the madison area .
i do n't hate blue martini , but it 's definitely not my favorite place to grab a drink . it 's loud and they play current pop so it 's fun to get your dance on , but it 's definitely not my go to .
this is my new favorite breakfast place .
it surprises me to see the reviews of this place are so enthusiastic .
the restaurant is nice although it 's a little on the dark side at night and a little loud .
a little expensive , but i feel as if it 's mostly justified .
my boyfriend gets the fish with sweet chili sauce and pineapple .
we 've been to gilbert location and had amazing burgers ; huge with so much favor !
we had the chicken tikka masala , lamb curry , and chicken with almond sauce .
i am giving an additional one star only because the customer relations manager came by and apologized to us and in fact give us the remainder of our food for free .
pizza is pretty damn good as well . pricing is decent and atmosphere works for .
the cheese was excessive and gluey .
the prices are very reasonable .
one of said coworkers was being loud and joking around , and apparently said something that upset a hostess .
i will say that the drink selection was good and they had some good beers on tap .
the pizza is amazing - everyone at the party commented on the amazing crust !
drinks are reasonably cheap and good .
the frittata was awful and dry .
i asked for a blended margarita and was told they only do on the rocks . what kind of bar does n't have a blender ?
food is tasty , ambience is good with nice music . weather is awesome which made the outdoor rustic seating extra nice .
it 's pretty pricey , and that would n't be bad if the food quality were indicative of the price - we actually eat out often at a $ 20+ per person price point .
the sazerac and lemon drop martini were fine , and very reasonably priced , although the martini was too sweet for my taste .
i 'm happy to recommend . overall , a great start to restaurant week !
very awesome service here and friendly , attentive and defiantly get what you need going .
their customer service is good and the place is nice and clean .
not bad and they had a great selection of beers on tap and mixed drinks and wine .
the lavraki was full of bones and was about 8 ounces ( not one pound which is what they said it was ) and cost $ 54 .
i want to love this place ! i do !
i do like that they have the smaller options on their burritos granted you only pay a $ 1 less but it is a little bit smaller .
pretty average lunch price wise and definitely worth checking out at least once .
unfortunately i think it was made with ketchup as a base for the sauce .
kale salad , flavor was great .
great little coffee shop in the varsity ! not the usual place for a coffee shop being so far from the usual spots such as 17th ave. the interior of euphoria is very simple and cozy which suits its purpose .
i ca n't stress this enough : the music was blasting so loud that the bartenders wear ear protection ; so loud i almost feel like i should remove another star .
the wine list is fantastic .
i really liked the potato cake though . yum !
very delicious ! definitely will return due to the excellent service .
and the drink selection is amazing !
walls are chipped up and needing attention and the lighting is just too bright .
great food and drink .
i tried the chicken and agreed that it was just bland meat with no flavor .
6 beers on tap and only one watered down version if a beer , so that 's a plus .
i had a bite off of my cousin 's pasta dish and found the pasta very al dente and the sauce rather bland .
only issue was the lighting .
can not beat the reasonable prices .
wow , the coffee & tea drinks here are amazing .
food was sub par not good and not bad , basically it was blah .
the salad was boring and bland , the main course of meatballs and spaghetti was so incredibly boring .
so , nice evening and nice location to relax .
the chicken had a wonderfully fresh lemon flavor .
his tacos looked decent , but the meat i tasted was unimpressive .
and on only parts of the filet mignon ( not the entire thing , odd enough ) , was salty .
nothing fancy , though , and the walls and carpeting in the hallways were especially worn and in need of replacement .
small restaurant , nice place for intimate settings .
the beef had a great taste but was a bit tough .
the lighting inside is very dim , to the point of almost using my cell phone light to read the menu .
i hate it 's clean designer lite decor .
the atmosphere is n't bad with the dim lighting and all , but i could do without all the arizona nature porn on the wall .
the smell was awful and so was the taste .
the drinks were exquisite and imaginative . the service ?
yikes , bad all the way around . had to wait because they forgot my order .
i had the carbonara . amazing .
their prices are very decent .
orange table is tucked away without it 's own parking , but if you park in the right place ( by the saguaro and close to indian school road ) you will see the best kept grass , trees and gardens in old town .
very cool feeling to this place .
hubby tried the ( i think it was blueberry ) martini and i had a delicious shiraz which i would always recommend as an easy red wine !
prices reasonable . quality very very good .
it is so exciting to finally have a pei wei by our home , yay ! we came to this location for pick-up for the first time last night and it is so nice .
the breading was delish but the inside was kind of dry .
great atmosphere and place to relax . patio is comfortable .
the lights were dimmed so not bright enough to read the menu with using your cell phone flash .
i do n't drink beer but the waitress said they had a good selection .
you got ta check this place out , this is our new favorite place !
we ordered the lobster bisque , lettuce wedge and medallions of beef ( which we shared ) . everything that we ordered was excellent .
the service was amazing would i come here for 60 $ ?
the house margarita was n't bad either .
everyone ordered a different cocktail .
it was a little over $ 20 so not super cheap .
the food was alright , nothing special .
we went on a tuesday night and it was pretty busy .
and as new-ish parents with a young baby , we so appreciate restaurants that ( a ) do n't judge parents for drinking , ( b ) welcome kids , and ( c ) have a changing table in their bathrooms .
only complaint is we wished they had beers on tap , though they had a decent bottle selection .
their employees are so friendly and more than happy to give you samples on things you are n't too sure about .
this restaurant is very reasonably priced .
the salad was fresh and had a nice lemon vinaigrette .
it remained mostly uneaten . i would have ask our server to have it heated up , but sadly she was over taxed by the three tables she had in her section .
my family and i came in here for lunch and we enjoyed the food .
i especially loved that the bathrooms have the tv audio on the speakers so you do n't have to miss a moment of the game !
loved everything about it ( except bathroom is bland comparably even tho drop gold trim ceiling is an attempt ) .
there is a train that travels around the ceiling of the cafe , which is a cute touch .
the beer selection was solid , but i would n't come here for cocktail or anything . beer and shots only .
they have a three-course price fix lunch for only $ 29 and it was so worth it .
i only frequent the market area . the bar and restaurant area upstairs i have been to once .
there was no beer on draft , and the waitress was inexperienced .
the food was freshly prepared and tasted good .
the prices are very reasonable .
i feel like price wise they are like an expensive steak house where you are nickel and dimed to death .
it was delicious - thin crispy crust , flavourfull topings , all very fresh .
the meatballs were actually kind of bland , only helped by the sauce you picked to put on them .
the burger was very good , and the pulled pork and bbq sauce made it tasty , but the e real winner was the service . jordan was excellent .
the proportion sizes of all the dishes are great for the price .
the wait , service , and food were all just mediocre , but it is a good place to take someone just for the experience .
extra star for the interesting decor and funny ass signs posted around the place .
so glad we tried it .
i would recommend the lentils in berbere sauce , and the collard greens were delicious as well .
only gave it four stars because the price of the orange juice . 3 $ a glad is pretty steep for a medium sized glass , especially when you can order a mimosa for the same price .
however , about 3 months ago my mom was in town and we were tired and wanted to eat something quick so we decided to finally give jalisco 's a whirl .
i popped a piece in my mouth and chewed and chewed and chewed getting that greasy coating on my tongue again , so i examined the other pieces in my bowl and saw that it was just pieces of tough fat .
i finally settled on the fettucini alfredo , as it 's a simple dish and hard to screw up .
you made my experience relaxing and enjoyable .
we had the strawberry vodka foam pepper cocktail which was made just right ... not to sweet and very satisfying .
romeos pizza is delicious .
ordering was a nightmare because this server could not speak or understand english well , rung up the wrong order , and then shrugged when she realized she was wrong .
the location is not in the best neighborhood but i felt safe and comfortable .
if you are not going during happy hour , i 'd say you are going to pay about $ 15 per meal on average .
i think the problem was that it was too authentic for me . i 'm pretty sure soup contained a blood broth and the flavor was just not to my liking .
we started with cocktails which were delicious , i had the strawberry crush and it had the perfect mix of fresh muddled strawberry and alcohol with a graham cracker rim .
$ 12 for a beer ridiculous .
we got home and his burger was cold , not even luke warm and the meat was very stiff and stale . the fries were also cold and very cold .
westgate ! west gate has been one of my favorite hangout spots for a long time , since high school !
i could n't try the cocktails due to being preggo but they made me a delicious mocktail !
the egg and pastrami breakfast sandwich was a huge portion , and the quality of both the scrambled eggs and pastrami was good .
they are reasonably priced and a decent portion .
there is a crunch component which is really unique .
our food was cold . we notified the manager on duty and she was unapologetic .
i highly recommend this restaurant to anyone with a sense of adventure .
this place is more than good ! great flavorful louisiana cuisine .
window seats were nice to sit by as i love to people watch .
i love chipotle but this is the worst managed chipotle ove ever been to from los angeles to new york !
i also like the bar/lounge area which allows you to just hang out whether taking in a movie or not . definitely a date night special or just a cool spot to enjoy .
it is also very tasteless .
the pastas are made in-house and the octopus is so delicious and perfectly cooked .
so far , i 've had the fire grilled chicken breast and the sweet pork barbacoa ; they are both delicious .
i also ordered a peach soda drink and it was great ! very authentic peach taste !
for dinner , we shared three different curry .
the drinks are also very reasonably priced .
i call shade and rude for this place .
maybe if it was $ 2- $ 3 i would n't mind but for $ 5 for a small little bowl of gravy is absurd !
ambiance did n't feel right for some reason , between weird mood from employees , music not consistent with the restaurant theme and outdated china and silverware .
sauce was just right and not too heavy .
thought the name meant beer or good drinks . beers were pricey .
great food , good atmosphere and great customer service . overall , a great place to go !
great food . fish are fresh .
i am sorry you have lost me as a long time customer .
been coming here since they opened . now that i have moved to california we still make sure we stop by to have some pizza and wings .
visiting from out of town so we decided to eat here since the place looks really nice with outside seating .
the beer selection was solid , but i would n't come here for cocktail or anything . beer and shots only .
atmosphere is cozy with eclectic decor and color you can sense this place has history .
any time a server delivers your margarita with , `` i 'm a terrible bartender because i like drinking too much .
while it was edible , nothing at all fabulous . very disappointed : (
however the lighting was so bad that i felt like i was eating in a dungeon .
paid 30 $ for a cold pizza when it showed up 1 hour an a half later . really terrible customer service .
i did no drink one , but apparently the margaritas were pretty good and not a bad deal by the pitcher .
my son and daughter both had chicken tenders they were dry and the waiter offered nothing but ketchup to put on them it also tasted like the fryer grease has not been cleaned since they opened .
possibly the best people watching ( with outdoor table ) in vegas .
the food is super fresh and flavorful , and it could be the best thai food i 've had in vaughan . the basil beef especially is amazing as was the beef fried rice .
great food , great service in a nice location .
the wine list is great , with a nice selection by the glass .
also for approx $ 10 . pretty reasonable , i thought .
i enjoyed sitting outside and enjoying a nice breeze .
prices are also very good .
i would definitely return especially for happy hour !
for alcohol it is just wine and one kind of beer .
jade at the front at registration was awesome friendly and helpful .
service : there was 1 person working and he was pretty nice but overall service was just ok. i went on a wednesday night so there were n't many customers , however every time we asked for something the answer was usually 'no we do n't have it . '
the restaurant is very clean and has a lovely covered patio - just right for a hot summer 's dinner .
overall its clean and food decent with decent prices .
and i 'm not talking about iced teas or cokes included , i mean beer and wine as well !
surprisingly good food - and the prices are good too .
weekend special 2 for $ 25 good salsa , appetizers and service .
not to mention that all of the food was over seasoned with pepper . that is the only thing we could taste .
they did n't taste too bad , but they were very average .
even one of the draft beers was bad !
draft beer was not as cold as it should be , order bottles . crappy music .
you ca n't go wrong with the deluxe pizza well done . chicken francaise is a ca n't miss here .
prices kinda high , though , at almost $ 55 a head , but what the heck for this kind of experience !
we were surprised at how fresh all the fish was ... the spicy tuna on top of our tiger roll melted in the mouth ... omg .
walking in , i felt a little intimidated by the overwhelming presence of stuff on the walls and trophies everywhere .
there were only 3 tables with customers .
the marble ( i think ? ) steps and the black on the curtains and walls made the restaurant look that much more sophisticated .
they were good , but could have used a little more salt .
the ceiling tiles are in bad shape , with lots broken and stained . the whole ceiling looks bad .
taquitos were overcooked & tough . fish bowl had dried out fish on top .
soft , warm and very rich .
this is a must try . great service , clean restaurant
i think a huge component of eating is about food presentation , so was disappointed to find a salad that looked like something i could have literally slapped together by dumping different ingredients on in under a minute .
the prices are a little high , but the service is fast .
meatloaf was flavorless and topped with burnt bacon . not a good experience .
the strawberry buttered waffles with chicken was good . also their shrimp and grits were great .
the meat is bad and loaded with salt to cover the staleness .
this had been written down , and she even successfully avoided bringing us tacos , which she told us had cilantro in them .
the reception was horrible even though we were one of only three people in the lobby .
the stewed chicken was dry , almost hard in the middle .
i ordered a margarita which was 12.75 but it was during `` happy hour '' time so i 'm not sure if they were pouring light for those drinks and ended up pouring light for mine .
their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers .
good thing the prices are super reasonable .
beer selection on draft was actually pretty poor . or at least the menu was .
however , it was ridiculously packed with too much rice .
i love the building and how they kept a lot of the church 's features .
after about thirty five minutes , we started to wonder where our food was , especially since some tables seated after us had already received their meals .
sauce was a bit sweet , so might have been plum sauce , do n't know .
he liked the chicken . his pasta and sauce were also cold , the sauce bitter .
another bummer was that they only service wine and beer , but lacked a strong list of either .
the prices are a bit higher than most places but you get what you pay for here and it 's definitely good quality there .
while it 's about as authentic as apple pie , the ground beef chimichanga was literally the best one i 've ever had !
the service was worse than horrible if this person was n't purposely trying to run us off they could n't have done a better job of it .
bill was fairly steep but worth it for sure !
it was better than a margarita : ) the citrus was n't overwhelming and the balance between the mixes and the alcohol was perfect .
good drink specials on beer , wine and cocktails . great appetizer specials ( $ 5 prime rib sliders are my favorite ) and a cool urban vibe in the bar .
just a real nice balance of ingredients .
is it just me or is lighting just crap at every hotel ?
highly recommend going at night , so you can see vegas in all its glory .
kind of like feet .
good food , good service . green curry was yummy .
good live music though but you can find that at many places in the phoenix area with more relatable staff .
super friendly staff . jacob the manager was super warm and welcoming .
no draft beer there but a nice cold bottle of corona .
a great value for the price .
stopped in for a quick bite and had another great experience .
it was pretty good but overpriced for the size it was . was $ 10 .
the portions are huge .
not sure who came up with the whacked cocktail menu but fortunately they have a good selection of craft beer on tap .
awesome menu - lobster benedict , lox and onions on a bagel i think , fresh and tasty stir fry ( vegan menu ) .
really great food and reasonable prices .
the food should sell itself you do n't need to put `` ultimate '' in the name of the restaurant .
mediocre , but expensive food .
he greeted us with a smile , was very attentive and a really nice guy .
our server just assumed that we wanted a certain amount of servings without asking .
prices are not too bad , for a club and a burger ( no drinks ) it 's about $ 18 .
the meat was decent other than that the food was terrible .
for $ 16 its a small portion , but its delicious , and generally lobster rolls are not cheap !
i do have to say that their chicken and egg fried rice was good but would i come back ? most likely not .
and , it seemed they had refunded it after i asked them if everything was all right .
what i got was canned grease butter with canned garlic and dried oregano sprinkled in it as a sauce for my wings .
i would classify the food as ok. it filled my stomach and that is about all . i would prefer to have tasted a really good meal than just fill the stomach .
this was a terrible experience !
the nuts were made into a paste and the chocolate was melted and thin but yet still seemed rich .
the presentation was nice and it had potential , but the sauce was so overly spicy that it was hard to taste anything else .
it is run very well , open to experience a great meal .
after wanting to try this place for dinner for awhile , i have to say i 'm disappointed .
the bread was n't grilled which was disappointing .
good food at a reasonable price .
looked like they had a good selection of beer on tap , even though i did n't have any .
everything is made to order and fresh . also loved the appetizer platter and the dill rice
i think the bartender may only be good at pouring beer .
i thought it might have been a little on the dry side .
we waited over an hour for our breakfast and the waiter was extremely rude .
ingredients are fresh and flavors are authentic .
the food is n't cheap either .
check out their happy hour and market in downtown phoenix too .
the fish was good , but not excellent as it was slightly overdone to my taste . good though .
do n't bother . the three draft beers our group tried were tasteless , even after we specified we prefer hoppy brews .
the more outrageous part was this meal cost more than $ 20 .
smiling faces and bubbly loud environment . come patient and hungry .
our only seating options were inside the bar area or outside on the patio in the 107 degree heat .
even the bathrooms felt classy ( this is important , let 's be honest ) !
this place is nothing fancy , but it 's clean and the sushi is bargain priced in my opinion .
wish i had visited this secret place a long time ago .
for sure , one of the ideal place to bring a date : ) ... i like the flower vase set at the center of the house .
ate our food cold due to our server not being able to multitask .
they are quite expensive but you get what you paid for .
good bar to drink at ... but maybe not eat at
prices are very reasonable .
also we tried to order dos equis on draft but there was something wrong with the tap that made it taste like a completely different beer .
i was impressed with the drink selection .
regardless , the venetian is beautiful , the mall , the restaurants , the pool !
we ordered a bottle of wine ( a very impressive list that covered about two blackboards in itself ! )
the layout is almost uncomfortable and haphazard in a neat and orderly way somehow .
no beer on tap , though , which is disappointing .
i was really disappointed to find the restaurant had no beers on tap , only bottles .
the lobster risotto was a disappointment . the flavor was lacking , the rice was too al dente , and the dish was pretty much cold on arrival .
room was nice , but expected more . hallway was dirty , bathroom ceiling had hair stuck to it , ( gross ) , no coffee maker or refrigerator .
waitress not at all attentive , heard her tell another party she did n't know anything about the food !
everything we ordered was disgusting , the batter on the tempura vegetable was heavy and oily .
then the decor and color is so plain and unwelcoming . not particularly clean and bright .
they are very generous with their portions and the food here is excellent !
but , to charge me .75 a glass when you 're already gouging me for an $ 6 for a cup of coffee seemed a bit extreme .
a bright colored rug / blanket hangs on the wall , drowning out notice of any other wall decor that might have been there .
portion sizes were perfect , ingredients were fresh and seasonal , and paired with a nice glass of pinot grigio and good conversation , the evening positively flew by .
for $ 11 it 's a little bit pricier than what i liked , but the fundamentals were there .
would n't recommend to anyone unless you want a bad .
when my friends told me they wanted to eat at a buffet for dinner , i was n't impressed , especially when they told me how much it would cost .
i joked with our server that they should tell people that the entrées are more than enough for two people or more and he jokingly told me that in the past when he had made such comments , some guests took offense to this implying that they would n't be able to handle the amount of food that was served so he now let 's the guest be surprised .
the basil chicken and yellow chicken curry have to be some of the best i have ever had .
great beers , bartenders do n't know anything about the beers . the menu is ok. not bad to pair beer with .
we ordered bottled beers -- their beer selection is good , i will give them that .
unless you have a thing for weak , tasteless cocktails , i suggest ordering a beer or glass of wine .
everything tastes bland and was n't much flavor to the food .
i will start with the margaritas on a good note !
the prices here are quite cheap , with most tex-mex dishes coming out to $ 9-12 .
good stuff . its pretty no frills food - cheap prices , quick service , but tasty , tasty eats .
it 's quite pricey for some poor quality food .
the menu is pretty comprehensive and the prices are fair .
we ordered the mussels in wine sauce and the fries and fell in love with both .
the food was good and reasonably priced .
the prices here are also very reasonable .
during our visit we tried the fish and chips which the fish was cooked absolutely perfect and it came out piping hot and golden brown , the fries were also cooked while .
the croissant itself was also buttery , flakey , and delicious .
unfortunately i have to echo the sentiment expressed in other reviews about the attitude of management .
its just a little expensive .
the decor was a little weird though . very colorful , but the themes do n't match up .
the mandu soup was the most disappointing part out of the meal .
huh ? bartenders were ok ... though real slow getting me another beer .
they had some great drinks on draft that tasted like beer .
the pickle was sour and nasty , and there was so little bread to contain the meat that the sandwich fell apart and i had to finish it with a fork .
fantastic food at unbelievably affordable prices ... like , crazy cheap .
when we brought it nicely to the attention of our waiter , he made no attempt to rectify it or show it to the chef .
it 's very stylish and sexy ( yeah , i have a rule about using sexy to describe anything that is n't a lady , but oh well ) .
every time i have had a poor experience .
the lighting was bad , very dark inside which felt weird while having breakfast .
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
we enjoyed the stuffed pork medallions & the seafood relleno side dishes were chipotle mashed potato & cornbread .
i also had the steak sandwich ( ca n't remember the name ) . it had a bit of a kick but was cooked to perfection and had very good flavor .
we wanted something with `` chips and salsa '' and a decent beer selection .
there was no one waiting behind us , so we chose to wait .
the staff and the manager ron are extremely helpful and friendly- the line moves quickly and it 's always clean .
the entire plate was not edible .
my boyfriend and i ordered bottles of mgd beer , which is a pretty common beer .
great table , excellent service , sam had great recommendations and bought me a bday shot of blended tequila .
and you ca n't go wrong with the 2 for $ 20 special .
it was good , but not $ 30 dollar good .
prices are pretty cheap with a 14 '' pizza and 2 drinks for under $ 20 .
about 5-6 in total .
tacky , but honestly , i think it 's amusing and gives it character .
the house margarita was n't bad either .
i love this place .
they were on the dry and bland side .
the rooms are a bit dated and good luck doing any makeup in that room because there 's zero lighting .
i tried to convince myself that i only ordered it 'cause you get a complimentary drink ( sangria , margarita , or champagne ) when you order their brunch buffet .
never had a bad experience .
first of all , they only have beer and wine , no liquor .
the beers were ok , nothing special .
always accommodating and attentive .
love this place ! bailey is very nice and pleasant !
not pretentious or touristy as the scottsdale rd bars ; more of a working joe & josephine 's bar .
it 's just kind of looks a little rundown and dirty .
i stole some of hubby 's pork and it was very nice ... juicy and smoky .
also , the lilikoi margarita is wonderful .
60 dollars for two people and one drink is two dollar signs only if both people had a three course dinner , not when one of two people leaves the place semi hungry .
very good , very cheap !
the sandwiches are put through an oven and they come out hot and melty .
i was told they have a good selection of beers on tap .
tried the moonshine and the happy ending , both good and got a nice buzz .
thank you to the kind , joyful man who made this for me .
it 's great food ! and surprisingly fancy for such a reasonable price .
the food was good and a reasonable price .
if it were n't for the tasting policy this would have been a 5 star review -- if they ever change the policy then we 'll change it to 5 stars , for sure .
what 's worse , it 's almost $ 10 .
it was terrible . i 've had better frozen pizza .
i understand they 're running a business , but charging $ 9 for water is ridiculous .
our guide was very sweet and funny , and also very knowledgeable about the area and our horses .
the food came cold , the brisket came chopped and seemed like they chopped the bones and all .
once i got into the restaurant , i was quite impressed with the restaurant 's decor and atmosphere .
used to get food for everyone on the job from them but not anymore . sucks to see a place with so much potential have such terrible service .
when we showed up , there was a line out the door , but it was n't too far out the door and seemed like a good sign , so we waited .
they only have four beers on tap , everything else was bottles .
their interior is super clean and chic decor .
very good food for a reasonable price !
this place is an absolute rip-off charging $ 7 for 4 fried pieces of dough . although their food is good , the inflated prices left a bad taste in my mouth .
cool place to hang out . cheap play and great staff .
veal tasted dry inside ... is that possible with ravioli ?
the food is amazing here but the best part is that it has the most stunning view of the las vegas strip from inside the restaurant .
seafood fettuccine ( $ 20 before tax ) : good , but nothing special . a little more than what i 'd pay for , in terms of price .
amazing brisket tacos . i live across the street , and this is just the thing i need late at night when i am looking for something that is n't pizza or poutine .
nice atmosphere and vibe .
it came with salsa and cost only like $ 5 .
thanks to beth and her great staff for a wonderful night out !
it was pretty rough . other tables near us had it worse .
some areas can be noisy due to the room acoustics so be careful where you sit if you want to have a quiet conversation .
we love this place !
nice atmosphere , good mid week stop !
john and his team run a great place .
the salmon skin roll was my favorite .
sorry , i 'd rather give my $ $ $ to pleasant people .
amazing knowledge of cocktails , as well as beers and the like .
the scenery inside is very nice and they have put more effort into it than some hotels have . their pool area is also much larger than some of the other hotels on the strip .
i do n't mind the $ $ if the food is good .
disappointed they did n't have liquor but only wine or beer - had to order sangria .
$ 16 for half a chicken did n't seem to be outrageous to split .
nice vibe in old montreal .
so if your looking for a spot with a cool ass vibe hip hop infused music and some good bar food this is a must go to place in toronto .
they only had the window bar seats open so we agreed to just sit there .
the prices are pretty steep here for the amount of food you get so 3 stars instead of 4 .
pretty ok selection of beer bottles and draught which is what i was after .
if you do go here make sure you babysit the workers they are not trained or do they know how to make pizza which means the manager is running this location very poorly .
he was very attentive and friendly .
pricing is very reasonable and the lunch special portions are huge for the price .
fortunately one employee was nice enough to help .
this was an excellent recommendation by a friend , whose husband is a professional chef .
the bathroom set up is kind of awkward .
the room itself is showing its age , the tablecloths on the tables were ugly , lighting was incorrect and staff was seen dragging tray jacks and pushing around a rack of glasses on wheels to place dirty dishes on .
i started with the riesling , which was smooth and sweet .
two things blew me away- the grapefruit basil martini with a perfect sugar rim .
it did n't start off bad , we made reservations and the hostess was friendly .
i love this place . customer service is always superb and the food is great .
price is very good the late night price is even better .
i left full and buzzed and happy . server was great .
the one thing i have to say about the ambiance is that the music was way too loud .
both buffalo natives , we had a hard time finding pizza in nc that we loved after relocating here . we have found it !
in short , i had a great experience and will definitely eat here again !
been there twice so far .
the ambiance was nice , a little trendy but european .
tasty and reasonably priced for lunch .
the interior is a little odd , and i think needs some changing ( think random pops of color and very cheap furniture ) .
a chicken and shrimp combo is always a good choice too .
no draft beer there but a nice cold bottle of corona .
the bartender was very precise in each and every drink , and i was tempted to order every cocktail on the menu .
the house made tonic is a bit sweet for my taste , but overall , a most delightful cocktail !
i love sitting outside when the weather is nice .
we ordered tropical guacamole and it was watery and full of pineapples , i 'm not sure avocados were even involved in that situation ... we had the poke tostadas , which nearly made me sick and i love raw fish .
the waitress and waiters here do not treat their customers like people and they feel entitled to provide bad service because they think they will always have the line out the door , because it 's one of the only dim sum place downtown .
do not expect great customer service .
oh , i almost forgot , they have very creative ceiling details and strange paintings of dogs everywhere too .
i would love to say the decor is delightfully tacky , but it 's not . it 's just plain tacky .
but to us it tasted burnt , bitter and the milk was too hot .
even though they are located in an office building , it is easy to access the restaurant .
as we sat down we noticed others around us becoming impatient and one of the groups indicated they had been waiting over an hour for their food .
i work hard for my money and i expect others to work hard for me when i spend it !
this restaurant totally cheated on me .
that would n't have been so bad if we had n't been told we would be seated right away .
pricing is decent , about $ 25 per person , a great casual spot or either lunch or dinner .
love the food here , and i 'm a big fan of their wine specials . this is where we take our out of town guests , and one of my favorite restaurants in madison .
good food , good prices .
had a pulled chicken sandwich that was amazing ! the flavor combination was really interesting and unexpected .
the interior design appears to be done by a blind person from the 80s .
this place is terrible , and i 'll tell everyone about how they stole our money for a meal that we ca n't even eat .
how bad could it be ?
then we shared the enchiladas and the macho salad with rotisserie chicken .
prices are actually reasonable for the ingredients and area .
they did n't have any beer on tap , only select few bottles which was disappointing .
the bathroom was disgusting ! tissue all over the floor , lights out in some of the stalls , no hand soap , water all over the counter and garbage that was overflowing !
that and the walls desperately need paint , place just does n't feel clean .
dressings on the side , whatever they were , were very tasty . a quick dip of the rotisserie chicken was yum !
wonderful service , extensive wine list and stiff drinks as my husband put it .
they are n't expensive , but do n't expect a 50 cent wing kind of deal .
the breakfast sandwiches are awesome and at the right price too . i also love the coconut french toast .
the prices are very reasonable considering the food is delicious .
they worked fast to clean the tables for us and within seconds of sitting down , we were already asked if we were ready to order .
the decor is awesome and unexpected . i loved the back patio .
both dishes were great and our dessert was a soufflé that was to die for !
see restaurants like this i have love hate for .
could n't wait to try this restaurant with its weird name and kitschy deco .
the food quality was disappointing . the garlic soy chicken was salty , as well as the meat on the bulgogi sliders ( salty ) and the slider bun not even warmed or slightly toasted .
nobu is famous for the black cod miso , and holy cow , it was absolutely unreal .
i understand accidents happen but the customer service was horrible .
also it smelled amazing in the restaurant and the music was on point .
great spot for drinks and apps .
that drink was so good and refreshing on a hot summer day .
we started off with the passionfruit bellini , which was incredible .
a franchise owner should know that they need to follow the company 's promotions especially if the location is on the coupon .
the waitress was kind when she served us but because it was mother 's day they were very busy .
i like the casual feel of the snack bar .
wait times are also ridiculous because they are extremely disorganized when they get busy .
they looked like bland , overly processed , chalky cakes .
they also have large beers for a reasonable price ( while reasonable for vegas ) .
we decided to come because we heard this place was great for families with kids .
my friends and i were basically ignored as all the employees were just hanging around talking but were finally asked if we 'd like a table which seemed obvious but apparently not .
we had to get up and get our own ! our waitress also forgot to ask our order , did n't even come to check on us .
here 's my impression : decor : pretty sterile and unwelcoming .
their sandwiches are pretty good and very reasonably priced .
the specials are unique , high quality and great value .
the coffee flavor was superb but a little too creamy for my liking .
so it 's not the best sushi in the world , but it was good , fresh and very fast .
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
when we got there , i did n't realize the lighting was super bright with funky light colors .
chicken steak and cheese steak are delicious . fries are good .
such a steal ! quality is pretty decent too .
i had high hopes about being able to go in summer for indoor entertainment .
( almost 1/2 off all bar drinks and i believe there is an appetizer special as well ) the bartenders are always friendly and attentive !
i do find it amusing how `` hipster '' the establishment seeks to feel with tattooed employees and rustic decor ... yet much of the clientele is overtly b & t , sigh ( not dive 's fault ) .
there was no beer on draft , and the waitress was inexperienced .
the food was well prepared . portions was good .
drinks were poured generously , and the service was pretty friendly , all things considered .
my cousin got the tomato salad , was pretty decent , grilled salmon was delicious ! it was fresh , tender , and rich flavor .
i think lots of restaurants cut corners and use cheap mixes that taste like cardboard .
however , the price is outrageous for just fish .
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
not a bad place to spend 20 bucks .
is it just me or is lighting just crap at every hotel ?
you feel like you 're hanging out in your living room , which makes it great for a relaxing meal or meeting with a group of friends .
the prices are very reasonable .
they also have a wonderful selection of drinks from boozy brunch cocktails , coffee and an assortment of teas .
the price is very reasonable .
the rolls were filled to perfection .
excellent service . great place for a first date and a bottle of wine .
i had a peach margarita along with my meal which was quite strong but good .
the food tastes so authentic and is just incredible .
glass of wine would have been nice but alcohol is not available so we ordered the rosemary infused lemonade and it was refreshing .
they did n't have any beer on tap , only select few bottles which was disappointing .
upon entering i could only notice the tacky decor and crap plastered along the walls .
the food is greasy , cheesy , mushy and not fresh at all .
the $ 3.00 soda was very small and mostly ice yet they still charge $ 1.08 for a refill .
do not come here the food is horrible over deep-fried everything taste old .
i see all the great reviews and really want to like this place because it 's right near my house but am disappointed every time .
it seems like they always take a minimum of 10 minutes even when you 're the only one in there .
only time i can recall where it was okay was when the person making our food asked us to try our drinks if they were okay because he felt that he might 've forgotten some ingredients .
ordered the shrimp , clams , and snow crab with the house sauce super spicy .
for the price of $ 13 , it was a bit expensive .
i had a wells drink ( rum + ginger ale ) that was decent .
anyone that has lived in the midwest knows good pizza and you just ca n't find it here ... ..until you go to bistro .
cons : overcooked ahi tuna ( was chewy ) , average onion rings ; burgers/sandwiches hastily assembled and hard to eat . stick with the burgers , fries and shakes , very disappointed in rest .
food was good , prices were reasonable and the margaritas on special for 4 bucks hit the spot .
beer was cold but all the mixed drinks had almost no alcohol .
i had much higher expectations and was a little disappointed . the avocado salad looked nice , the asparagus and broccoli were way too salty and the ribeye was just ok .
the fish selection is excellent if you want bass salmon lobster or eel they have it .
there was one guy at the counter , who was neither friendly nor rude .
edamame is a good bargain too for how inexpensive it is !
i was disappointed -- these scallops were succulent , with a crispy batter , and perfectly cooked !
i also got a cadillac margarita that tasted like they just lazily put the alcohol and margarita mix .
t.v 's everywhere , staff is very friendly our server ben is great explains everything in detail told us about there off menu items and was very accommodating with my girlfriends food allergies .
they do n't care to educate you on the menu and you feel stupid for asking a question .
not a bad bar .
so for 6 people i ended up paying like $ 10.50 , unexpected indeed !
came here for an early dinner and had a chicken salad and a hot chocolate alcohol drink .
i 've had worse meals .
reasonably priced and good service .
not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses , that were more like scotch glasses , only knock .
nothing made sense about the decor as it was trying to look somewhat upscale yet there are 90 '' flat screens lining every in inch of free space on the walls , again very uncomfortable service was terrible .
easy pricing and cheap pricing .
this location is usually busy but the staff is always pleasant . whenever i go in i make different transactions because i make coffee runs for the office , the staff is always gracious about this .
the food was delicious and reasonably priced .
the instrumental music was a nice touch that provided for a casual fast food dining experience .
the dos equis was good and cold , not a biggie , but i have had crappy tap beer in the past .
great food and reasonable prices .
i recommend eating in the bar area to take advantage of these deals , it is also a fun place to people watch from . the casino , as always is filled with characters .
it was not bad , even though i had expected more beet flavor .
they actually have a pinot noir , $ 5 during happy hour , and i think it is delicious !
the table we wanted to sit at ( no one else was in the restaurant ) was dirty . the manager told us to sit wherever we wanted , tossed the menus on the adjacent table and walked off like a spoiled teenager whose phone had been taken away .
filthy ! there is no reason a `` hole in the wall '' restaurant needs to be dirty ... the floors , the tables , the walls , the stained ceiling !
full bar , great cocktails !
for an appetizer we split the fresh mozzarella & tomato salad ... .which comes with marinated sweet peppers ... we add a little oil/vinegar and it makes for a nice appetizer .
my husband had a crispy chicken and i had the calabrian turkey .
finally the first girl looks up and says she 'll be right with us .
good food and great wine and a reasonable price .
the selections of food and beer with happy hour is great .
the restaurant itself was clean and concept was cool .
the interior layout is n't so bad and makes you feel comfortable when you 're eating .
atmosphere inside nice and outside very nice .
that is so desperate and tacky . not classy at all .
the only dish that was n't drenched in salt was the poached pickerel .
good but not life changing like i expect a $ 350 dinner for two should be . for the price of dinner i expect a higher level of service .
chin chin is a small little sushi restaurant in new new york . it is , by far , the best sushi restaurant in vegas .
this is n't tacky , it looks good .
however , customer service is very important , and not only was she rude , but also kind of insulting . personally i would not go back .
they charge fancy premium steakhouse prices but everything looks cheap .
one of our group finally was `` allowed '' to speak with someone in authority , at which point they relented and allowed us to order individually .
i decided to add the mint and lemon shot to it which made a great paring .
the interior is a little odd , and i think needs some changing ( think random pops of color and very cheap furniture ) .
great food and great all day happy hour ( bar only ) .
great atmosphere , prices , and quality .
i 'm a regular here and i 'm always very pleased with eat in or take out food from seven east .
average food at expensive prices .
everytime i come here i leave satisfied .
very cool and hip vibe to it .
and , of course , i had a cappuccino that a frenchman can make : strong .
with thirty some craft beers and wines on tap , beer drinkers are frozen with indecision which probably is annoying for the bartender .
the only thing that really bugs me is the lighting . it gives me a funky feeling like things are dusty , and they might not be , but the tone of the lighting makes it seem that way .
cheap prices and even better food .
the service is friendly , it gets pretty busy on weekend brunches and dinners so would recommend a reservation .
insane amount of food ( 2 to 3 full meals ) and it 's absolutely delicious .
they still did n't have anything on draft but a good bottle selection .
the boss came right on to me and friend and start questioning us , wtf !
the menu is quite large and have a huge selection of plates , wraps , and salads .
excellent . first time there as i 'm new to this area .
the decor is very dated and the cleanliness leaves something to be desired . our room was relatively clean if you disregard the weird stains on the curtains .
the beers were ok , nothing special .
though , he only came by once to see how we were doing and i had an empty glass of water for awhile .
egg rolls were delicious . crab puffs were filled generously and had excellent flavor .
my wife and i had a strawberry mojito and a watermelon mojito which we very flavorful and delicious .
i never have to force myself to drink anything with tequila in it , but their house margarita just did n't taste right .
prices a little high i would have given a five except for service and prices .
i 've also heard that they have an incredible patio .
that 's outrageous for the quality and quantity that you get !
i do n't know how this place has poor reviews .
it does n't taste like anything special .
the location is in a pretty nice area with many other food choices but i always come to this area for tacos !
great looking restaurant with some neat decor ( love the aquarium ) .
a good thing is that they give you a token that lights up and beeps when your table is ready so you can roam around the casino and play rather than hang around waiting at the café .
i get the fact of the hipster décor and approach to almost anything that involves food nowadays , but old christmas decorations lining the walls it just ridiculous .
good ambiance and service . food was good but personally think it is way over priced for $ 450 for a couple it should have blown my mind .
ca n't say much for the decor- tables and chairs are rickety and the decor bland .
great hotel . very great staff .
the food was amazing , and a great wine list to compliment it .
never have we been treated so badly in this restaurant and will never be again .
only thing going for this place is that there was no line , but i guess i figured out why .
i went to diego pops with my friends for the first time and my server anthony was very cheerful and very informative .
that 's as surrounded by love as you could ever feel .
i do n't know why , but the entrance feels weird , like its cluttered or just too confined .
the only thing that was a little subpar was the quality of the food . the fish tasted a little bit old and some of the food was overcooked .
their strawberry lemonade is a classic must-have . if you like ginger i definitely recommend the ginger lemonade , and the blueberry mint was excellently balanced .
hmmm , i better look into that coupon everyone is talking about in these reviews for the $ 10 off . and i 'm not sure why i paid $ 43 when it looks like everyone else is paying $ 34.99 .
i would highly recommend this for a quick late night meal .
the service last night was absolutely terrible .
what a terrible attitude .
service is really fast and pretty spot on . prices are amazingly cheap right around $ 6 with large portions .
when we finally got a chance to tell her about the food , she looked at us weird and said ok ... it was awkward . we just decided to leave .
zeppelin is well-decorated , i especially liked the room in the back with the leather booths that felt very cozy . great ambiance and music !
their prices are incredibly reasonable especially considering how much you get !
reasonable priced beer for the strip .
drinks were fine and they had a good selection of beers on tap .
food is really good , however you should check the price charged for your meal against what the price says on the menu .
they also have some great drink specials !
the atmosphere inside is very nice . staff is great and friendly and very attentive and helpful .
the drink ( margarita ) was very strong and not sweet enough . overall they get a d for food and an a for ambience and location .
but you need to pay a $ 6 entrance fee & drinks are n't cheap either .
food was uneventful , soup was not hot and bland , and they use dry rice noodles .
sweet rice - soggy and over cooked .
tom yum was very flavorful , not too hot . spring rolls were fresh and crisp .
ridiculously expensive restaurant for ordinary food .
but if you 're looking for reasonably priced pitchers of margaritas , this is your place .
food seems a little uninspired and generic , but it 's not bad . also did n't stretch very far on the value side , nothing offends me more than overpriced pasta .
no side of rice , no chicken on a stick , not the right kind of sushi .
the dish was lightly fried , not overly oily and had a good assortment of veggies to add color to the dish . my only dislike was the slight over pricing of the dishes .
speaking of the drinks , they were delicious !
not stuffy , not trashy , just right .
nice place for breakfast or just a coffee . cool building with a great interior .
the price is high for what you 're getting , both quality and quantity .
we asked the server a couple of questions ( most importantly , can we drink the alcohol that was set on fire or was it lighter fluid ? )
service is nice and prompt too .
no potatoes with it , but it did come with rice and sad salad ( tomatoes and iceberg ) .
great meal , great service , best view your going to get in vegas out on the patio .
three people milling around and not even a `` hello '' or a `` be right with you '' from any of them .
we came off the strip with 8 people and it was awesome ! beers , soju , karaoke !
they were great side dishes along with the pickled carrots , onions , and jalapenos .
it 's open late , has beautiful decor , friendly staff and delicious food .
not only will you waste 20 dollars on a dish that should cost 10 but the food is not good .
that is a ridiculous amount .
that was n't that bad , but what shocked me , was that there were more calories in the frozen custard than in ice cream or gelato !
, lousy service , loud , obnoxious singer who could n't carry a tune in a paper bag , way too dark , even with the stupid menu lights , ridiculously overpriced .
they did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it 's not all about crappy beer .
started with a bellini ( champagne and peach ) which was very refreshing .
the food is not good for the price you pay .
the bad news : the lighting was horrible , so bright you did n't even notice there were candles on the table .
prices are very reasonable as well .
they also have a full bar and happy hour .
one of the meals came out after everyone else 's meal , so they did the right thing and immediately told us that they would take it off of the bill .
only bummer is that i did n't see any draft beer , only bottles .
the ingredients were very fresh and prepped well . each bowl was presented beautifully and tasted delicious with their house sauce .
great value for the price !
the sangria was a good deal .
so , when i find a gem , i think its important to let you know .
if you are in vegas , it 's a must for brunch . highlight : all things baked and the chicken and waffles .
the food is not bad , and reasonably priced .
let 's not even discuss the thin walls or `` blackout '' curtains .
but the food was just good ( which deserved 4 stars ) but the manager seemed more interested in talking to the hostess than smiling at customers or asking them how they 're doing as he walked by . it 's a chain , what should i expect ?
maybe it was the buffet that i decided to get but the food in the buffet line was greasy and at best , bland .
i usually get a beer and as much as i enjoy a cold mug of beer i do wish i could get a cold pint glass of beer .
the decor and ambiance were super cool , and the service was great .
i will definitely be coming back , especially for happy hour : ) .
my favorite dish here .
the mixed drinks at the bar were powerful and delicious .
price ca n't be beat . cool little place .
first of all my welcome was a well come ... my server right away helped me with picking different selection of beers . that 's a start .
it was only one step above typical hotel lounge food .
i had one server who was outstanding and another server who gave below par service and just did not have his head in the game .
it did n't taste homemade and was bland .
the pineapple duck was spectacular and would easily have cost twice its $ 16 price tag elsewhere .
for $ 20 , i expected a pretty decent buffet .
the tomato jam with the steak was a perfect blend .
cool and trendy are only attractive if i do n't spend $ 100 on 4 drinks and a cheese plate without tip .
lunch specials are $ 12 and extremely filling .
we loved the vibe upstairs , especially the comfy couches !
beers were ok , but they were bottled beers , so it would be pretty difficult for them to ruin that .
the prices are very reasonable especially lunch .
we only do wine and beer at the bar . ''
we ordered a couple cocktails : madras and a huckleberry love signature cocktail .
dimly lit so they do provide flashlights , yes i am serious .
kind of like feet .
they have some good options that are good and reasonably priced .
the portions are huge .
-one bowl of ramen was on the menu and it was honestly mediocre at best .
and i get pricing on the strip is going to be higher than normal , but even if that sandwich was perfect , it would n't have been a $ 20 sandwich .
apparently it 's possible .
amazing dumplings and the tom yum soup was very good . best mango ice cream and fried banana .
perfectly cooked and he loved the sauce .
the restaurant layout was totally weird but who really cares .
she just said sorry and that was that .
there is a nice selection of beer and wine . the prices are reasonable for the quality of food that you are getting .
otherwise , the drink prices were super expensive , $ 11- $ 15 for a well drink .
the best strawberry mojito i 've had - so refreshing . and i 'm cuban , so i know mojitos .
the server took a cup of coffee off of the bill to make up for the messed up orders but overall i was far from impressed with everything .
couple that with some amazing mixed drinks and friendly service ( try the lavender bees knees or the blueberry four roses - we shared these , trust us ) .
the wine list is huge and the glasses are generous .
first of all , they only have beer and wine , no liquor .
the prices are fair and the plates are full . nothing fancy ... just a place that emanates warmth and a good bang for your buck .
it was only $ 14 .
nice touch . hey alice , who is the brilliant shit that decided metal leg chairs on concrete floor was a good idea ?
service and food have always been spot on no matter how busy they are . i try to bring all the out of town visitors here and they have never been disappointed .
the draft list was n't bad but nothing out of the norm .
the steaks are always tender , and cooked to perfection . sides are amazing , and good sized portions .
the location and scenery were great .
but now the wait staff is slow , and the management is terrible .
it 's also a cool music venue that makes me feel like i 'm in austin .
the outdoor patio is shaded and gives you a different feel then the mill experience you get .
i enjoy the laid back atmosphere and music ... very important especially on a sunday afternoon . very good meat to bread portion size control sofa seating and all .
i also checked in for a glass of wine : ) the ambience is great .
when i asked about the misters , he gave me a smart remark .
it 's cheap , but the quality is great .
really good food for reasonable prices .
do n't know what her deal was but ok anyways good service and good sushi , just watch out for that rude waitress lolz .
unless you have a thing for weak , tasteless cocktails , i suggest ordering a beer or glass of wine .
that , sir , earns your business a poor rating on all the review sites i belong to .
beyond the food menu , they boast an fantastic cocktail menu and wine selection - and harris was great at making drink recommendations based on our specific tastes .
love the decor ( has full couches ) and wish could come out here more often .
he got the chocolate espresso martini , which he swears was exceptional ( i would n't know , due to a hatred of all things chocolate ) and i got the red dragon sangria , which was exceptional .
the interior looks not too bad .
i do love go raw by the lakes and have visited there numerous times .
we had a fuzzy peach penguin mango goblet that was created by pitbull and it was so delicious !
it was greasy and rich and delicious .
yes , i tried everyone 's food . the kids working there are young and nice , offering pretty good service with a smile .
high points of the meal were the tender and moist battered chicken bites , clearly freshly made , a really good caesar salad , again , no bottled dressing for these guys , lovely smoky charred romaine salad , perfectly cooked norwegian salmon served on a bed of garlicky sautéed spinach with tomatoes and pineapple .
upon arriving i was a little put off by the expansive building , columns and statue , but my group sat in the bar area , which was comfortable .
never had bad food or service , so this review is no reflection on either .
the price is ridiculously cheap .
prices are actually more expensive than it shows on the online menu .
great food at reasonable prices .
the sushi was normal , but the pad thai was just a disgrace .
the owner was kind enough to offer me the monday special on a tuesday ( he must have known this was my first time visiting ) .
other than that , you can expect average food , average drink prices and mediocre service .
you do not need to make an unnecessary loud beep from the push of the buttons lol i was trying to adjust it while everyone was sleeping ... awkward .
to top it off the waitress dropped off one broken pen for the whole table to use when signing out checks . so we had to find our own pens to use .
service was great for first time visit .
decently good at a decently good price .
the room itself was n't bad , but the bathroom could use some major renovation . it reminded me of a cheap motel layout .
brought the issue to the manager and he was nice enough to give it an effort to correct the bad experience that we had !
you should not be on television for a while criticizing other people 's restaurant until you fix your shit first .
the one thing i missed in the beer list was an indication of how many ounces they pour for the different beers .
the lady did not show any kind of haste or care about my problem .
and that 's in la , where supposedly living cost is way more expensive than here in pittsburgh .
what a gorgeous , cozy space to spend a few hours in . the menu is really lovely and rich , a perfect winter spot i 'd say .
i am so glad this place is here ! the food is great !
my first time here and it was wonderful !
i could seriously just eat spoonfuls of it .
many of their beers were no name beers flavored with fruit , not clear what the base beer is ( bud or worse ) ?
cute , inviting decor .
the food did n't have flavor . sushi was terrible .
because he was honest i decided to stay and order food .
the only good thing was the dessert .
my only concern though is the lighting .
this may be my new favorite restaurant in charlotte .
good food for reasonable prices
unfortunately , when they brought my sandwich it had big sloppy globs of mayo on it .
prices are very reasonable .
the design is beautiful . and i love the mission too .
however , i found it puzzling that the host was turning away people when there were only four other occupied tables .
the atmosphere is fun and trendy kind of had that 80 's cool vibe .
ended our meal with the homemade carrot cake which was to die for . service was great .
they are always so nice and friendly !
amazing tacos ! my favorite are the tempura avocados !
the one thing i thought a little unusual was that they served beer , had a couple of taps and some bottled craft beers listed on a chalkboard .
the restaurant is very comfortable with a kind of trendy ambiance .
the yogurt ( ? ) garlic sauce is great .
i thought the interior was a little bland and the industrial chairs did n't fit the look to me .
the food was decent enough for the cheap prices .
good food at a reasonable price .
fantastic food at a great price operated by some great people . definitely on my top 10 cool family hang outs .
the cost was decent , $ 22.99 and add another $ 2.50 for the bottomless champagne , although cheap champagne it was still a cool deal .
the prices are rock bottom , dirt cheap , super bargain .
you could see behind the wallpaper .
i ca n't pinpoint it , unless it 's just that hotel bars swarmed with people wearing name badges are low key depressing .
anyways my calzone was horrible , the cheese was not even melted inside . the service was really really good .
now they just need to duplicate themselves on the west side of phoenix . this is one of those great finds in a restaurant
they are quick , nice serving size and reasonably priced .
sadly , our noodles were over cooked and too mushy to enjoy .
firstly : the restaurant name does n't give enough credit to the classy interior .
very bland cake , no flavor ! even the coating was plain tasting .
the atmosphere is bustling and full of character and characters . the perfect cleveland dive spot for brunch .
all the people that work here are really nice and the service is amazing .
i liked the bathroom layout for some odd reason .
great customer service ( but to be fair it was n't busy at all ) .
the prices are average for a burrito , but it 's definitely a great value .
unfortunately , the service was very poor .
i got my beer and i ordered dos equis but they brought another kind , but beer was beer and need beer in me .
the place is immaculately clean and the service is fast , friendly and accomodating .
love coming to this place from the time you enter it just is an amazing experience great salads entrées as well as sides the wagyu beef here is not as good as jean george 's but still great . love the pretzel break and chopped salad , cream corn and baked potato .
the fact that it 's `` secret '' and is located through a corridor also makes it a pretty cool spot .
we also tried the bbq pork , which was all right , but the roast pork was amazing !
the lighting is dim and my pictures sucked so no photos : )
on to the server , camille seems to lack a certain je ne sais quoi that every server should have , i do n't know if it 's due to the fact that she is just very straightforward or if she just does not enjoy her job but she comes off as slightly rude and nonchalant .
it 's super cheap too .
fair price , nice service .
was huge , tasted fine , but again ... .just average . the guacamole was below average .
the price is really reasonable .
not sure what the delay was but it took a while to get someone to come take our order so we coud enjoy some cocktails before dinner .
i 'm not sure what happen from me previously eating the chicken soup but it did n't have that excellent lemon favor it usually had .
but in the end did it for us even after we marked the bill accordingly with each couples ' items .
it was okay overall . not the greatest , but not the worst either .
salad was good . the portion was huge though .
the whole look of the restaurant is cozy , quaint , and gives an all over romantic feel which is perfect for a date .
nothing i have n't loved and everything is served in a generous portion thats its all shareable and never a problem - i love that !
the complimentary water is cold and refreshing though , comes plentiful in a cold blue bottle .
the captain mojito ( also $ 4 ) , however , was amazing and not too strong !
beers were good ( even though they didnt have any beer specials ) ... hmmmm .
this area is really growing into a nice hang out spot .
my problem was with the egg roll ... it dropped out so much grease when i was eating it . only ate half and felt sick from all the oil .
it 's creepy and weird .
this place is really cool .
the prices are pretty low for w what you get , and the quality is great .
good size portions and great value .
stopped by twelve for an early dinner and we are happy we did . we took advantage of the happy hour which was half off specialty drinks and apps .
beer selection through the roof . not a full bar though , just beer and wine .
the service is good and the decor is nice , and the outside patio area is great , but none of this matters when the food is lousy .
we loved the atmosphere and service of this new space .
only paid about $ 20 but got a lot of food for that price .
the prices are also reasonable .
loaded tots were awesome , but presentation could have been better .
i always make sure to order the special plate of banh cuon which comes with the added dill fish cake , and `` vietnamese corn bread '' tastes hella bomb .
the watermelon slushy i had was good .
of course , they offered us a free sample ( quite a bit ) of wine and also free appetizer while waiting .
they literally just waited for me to get mad and leave !
kind but like all salesmen trying to get you to order tequila , drinks , ( at 11 am ) beer , margaritas , dessert ? anything ?
the outdoor patio is really pretty and the chairs are comfortable , it 's also dog friendly .
hardly any tequila in it .
seating area is pretty small with tables close together .
the sisig was a lil on the dry side and the meat had a touch of lime flavor which was not too bad .
i was disappointed they did n't offer any beer on draft .
and it was a reasonable price .
had excellent breakfast and awesome service . enjoyed the atmosphere and had pleasant experience .
i ordered the crab cake benedict and my date ordered the breakfast sandwich . both were absolutely delicious .
very dirty ... they dont even clean the rooms . the walls had nasty stuff all over them along with the bathroom floor .
you have to come here . no matter how far you live
drinks are cheap , and it 's cash only . check this place out if you 're looking for some place that is laid back and a little quieter while still being spacious .
i thought it was great that there was n't a `` 3 topping , each additional topping $ $ $ $ $ $ '' like most places .
it 's cheap which i love and it 's pretty good .
here are some things i love about ipic : the drinks : very decent cocktails and the wine card .
the only issue i had was that all orders are put on one bill .
my pork belly was perfect and nicely balanced with the turnip , my friend enjoyed his venison and said it was cooked just right ( ie not much . ) the chocolate dessert was dreamy and perfect , rich and bitter with a little caramel to balance out .
it 's cheap and efficient .
that was several weeks ago and he has n't called us as he said he would . as far as i can tell , he was simply lying to us because he wanted to make sure he had our phone number available in the event that our gift card did n't have the amount on it that we said it did .
the food is good . prices are reasonable .
if you enjoy creative food and a pleasant atmosphere this is a place to seek out . thank you gm matt harwell for your hands on style .
we ordered guac & chips , margaritas , this pork tossed with potatoes and goat cheese dish ( delish ! ) , chicken wings and a taster ceviche .
reasonable price for a good amount of food
a nice steak costs money , you should have known this before you decided to spend $ 100 on that meal .
the buffet is reasonably priced , includes a drink and is delicious .
we ordered beers and were served some beer cocktail they were n't bad but i just wanted the beer not a cocktail .
had the pleasure of having dinner here at bachi burger and let me tell you ... it 's a great place to have a good burger .
i 'm so glad we went because it was a really special experience .
the only thing that really bugs me is the lighting . it gives me a funky feeling like things are dusty , and they might not be , but the tone of the lighting makes it seem that way .
my favorite drink would have to be the jasmine tea latte .
the presentation was so unappealing i am surprised she ate it .
location is slightly awkward inside with bad lighting but not too bad .
really ? on the plus side , our bartender was excellent .
the atmosphere here is just beautiful , and the staff is very nice .
i had a duck taco and a coffee braised beef taco and their homemade corn tortillas . excellent food !
the decor was straight out of sex and the city and , needless to say , outdated and tacky .
they have a great patio although we have n't sat there yet as it has been too hot outside when we have been there .
prices are very fair .
there are 2 area one side for large groups and one side is more intimate i guess for couples .
a bunch of annoying punks as well in the parking lot , drunk as hell talking sh*t. did someone pass out a flyer of this place in the ghetto and skanky side of vegas ?
food was okay , but def not worth the price . $ 18 for a turkey sandwich and coffee seems a bit ridiculous .
the chicken is decent , the sauce not so much . i asked for spicy and it became apparent they dont do spicy .
but he warned , i 'm pretty sure it 's basically margarita flavored beer .
ok this is not going to be good .
the to go menu prices on their website are wrong and my ticket was $ 15 higher than planned . $ 15 ?
the beef was very tender , but a bit tasteless . the bread was worse .
the drinks are fantastic as well - i highly recommend the pineapple mojito .
this is a casual place to get beer and wings . the beer prices are not the cheapest but the food is decent .
the food is good and fairly priced .
the margaritas were so weak i 'm not sure they even had tequila .
i 've tried the butter chicken , the lamb rogan josh , the chicken curry dish with the fenugreek , and one or two others , all of which i 've liked .
it is not worth $ 20 bucks , especially with the terrible service .
very good and decent prices .
the restaurant itself is beautiful .
i think the food is ok little dry the pork needs more bbq sauce .
and my meal did n't need to be poorly cooked and ice cold .
atmosphere was very nice & friendly staff .
always friendly service . this is one of my favorite breakfast stops in vegas .
the price of things here are fairly priced .
a little on the pricey side , ~ $ 35 per person without alcohol , but we had a good night .
because the front room has the vaulted ceilings , it is very very loud and there were only a handful of people in there .
the quality and quantity were satisfying .
the fish was fresh , the rice cooked perfectly and the combo of sweet and spicy from the sauces topped the dish off .
great spot in downtown cleveland .
with the food , the only blemish was the flat bread appetizer that was just too dry .
only real negative was how dark it was ; jet black walls and ceilings , dim lights , but that was n't a big deal .
attentive and helpful server - oh , and the local beer michael suggested was fabulous !
they have the worst system for taking orders and filling them .
good amount of calms as well .
wait staff is very snotty and when we told the manager we were leaving because they could not accommodate an elderly customer they charged us for the two iced teas and a soda ... terrible service . and then we had to wait to pay .
the margaritas with a pomegranate floater was so delicious that i had to have another .
i had a couple great specialty cocktails .
it was good , but sooo big that i just kind of got sick from all the pasta and cheese after eating about half . i ended up eating about 3/4 of it .
the best thing they had was the strawberry and peach sorbet , which was very refreshing .
the food ( desserts , lunch croissants , and ( especially ) chili ) are delicious .
honestly , i did n't really like anything other than dragon chicken but that dragon chicken was so good that i 'd go back just for that .
the wine list was reasonable .
plus the prices are very reasonable .
basil was not a good idea .
the interior was a different story .
beer was nice big but no cold glass .
a little expensive for what they give you .
beer was just not good .
beers are only available by the bottle , oddly enough .
a few more minutes passed and finally someone asked me if i needed help .
we split the caesar salad , korean fried cauliflower , and salt and pepper fried sandwich . the salad and fried cauliflower were the standouts , so good !
excellent food and drink ?
we walked into a private room with a huge television on the wall .
we ordered one pork and one steak , they were both bland and tiny and the chips and salsa were just okay .
parking is a pain in the a** the escalator is kind of scary due to the sideways movement ... and they 're actually really ugly .
but expensive for its size .
it is unfortunate they raised the price from 19.99 to 21.99 because now the cost is 25+ with tip and tax vs. a price south of 25 which makes me feel like it 's alot more expensive even that 's it 's just $ 2 more !
you got ta try the house tropic drink ( $ 10 ) it 's fruity , refreshing and not too sweet .
it 's sort of gothic and kind of trendy , but mainly just weird .
not one of the dishes was bad at all !
you 'd like a margarita ? you 'd like a happy hour margarita ?
i ordered a key lime martini and it was 15.00 for one and served in a tiny little glass !
the filet was delicious .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
everything that you touch there , after walking on the carpet , gives you a nice , static electrical shock .
i ordered the chicken hibachi and it was more of the same ; extremely bland , and the chicken was very tough .
but only if your order is $ 15 bucks or more .
( the cheese y mas is a must try but dangerous for the dairy intolerant ) they have a lot of open doors windows , so depending on the weather it can get a bit chilly and they keep it kinda dark .
the restaurants atmosphere is great also . although it is a little snug in there , everything is great .
if visiting arizona like i am i suggest this place for sure !
the only bad thing is the prices are high , but i hear they pay their staff more than other restaurants .
however they offer a happy hour on well drinks and draft beers but their draft beer wasnt working and they dont offer bottles in substitution so that was kind of disappointing .
topped the dinner off with vodka raspberry sorbet drink that was just right !
good service and food but not washroom had pee covering the walls . which makes me lose my appetite .
it is perfectly baked , the crust is crunchy and not soggy in the center . the tomato sauce is very fresh .
they make a great martini and the wine .
good food at great prices are a combination hard to find in phoenix . all breakfast 's are $ 6.99 .
also a lot of tv 's , no bad seats for watching games !
i came in for a late lunch on saturday and was seated promptly by the friendly staff .
because of the style of eating and the way the dishes looked similar to indian food , i think i assumed that there would be more flavour and punch but instead most of the food was pretty bland .
this was a great place to stop in while i was in vegas .
unfortunately , when we got another batch ( which was thankfully fast ) they less resembled cured meat but the taste was nonetheless bland .
the food remains delicious as always , but it should n't cost me $ 30 for appetizers . i 'd rather eat a pizza and appetizer for $ 20 instead .
great place , just not sure the pricing is quite reasonable .
it was the perfect amount of pasta and the salad was beautiful and tasty all in one .
this restaurant is just like a hard rock restaurant . most of the servers there wore makeup like alice cooper ... that was pretty cool .
the place was homey and cozy .
prices are pretty reasonable for a nice breakfast that is not your run of the mill stuff .
the hibachi is good but a little to sweet for my taste but still very edible .
pinot grigio : house wine was a good sized pour and crisp , a bit too acidic for me , possibly not opened today ?
the west end of the property looks bright and tight . kudos to the palms and it 's team .
the only feedback i have is the brick fencing that separates the street peasants from the wealthy and rich made me feel uneasy ( it 's very poor and financially unstable looking ) it was either that or the girl crying over the microphone playing piano .
three stars for clean store , nice color scheme , neutral service , and clean but unexciting food .
simply amazing . delicious homemade pasta with the tastiest of sauces .
all room doors are exposed to the outside which is not one of my favorite features but since it is in phoenix i guess wether is n't a problem .
the bathroom was nice and big , but the lighting could be better , it was kind of dark .
40 $ for an average breakfast just seems a bit ridiculous .
the decor was cute .
beers are only available by the bottle , oddly enough .
chris , his family and team are wonderful and we appreciate their gracious hospitality .
kudos to knowing your wine & spirits in additional to great food !
the place is also really cute , with great decor and fun music . would definitely recommend as a great unique spot in chinatown .
i had pork ribs that were rubbery and covered in fat ( not cooked nearly long enough ) . my wife had a great filet mignon ( undercooked for her liking ) but the sides were totally forgettable .
- yes , the bathroom looks like something out of the scariest of scary movies .
may seem pricy but i think the cost is justified as so much else is included .
it 's the looks and the snobby tones it 's almost as if i 'm annoying them .
watermelon mint feel free to ask them to sample the different drinks .
in the end it was around $ 80 per person , which is much more reasonable , but arguably still a lot .
tandoori chicken was a little touch and disappointing , but the chicken masala was very good by contrast .
i 'm surprised i have n't written a review about this place .
we ended up with the manager serving us as our order was all messed up . in the end , they comped us the meal & drinks , which was very nice of them .
horrible . do not spend your money here .
we did n't try the drinks but the drink menu and bar were servicing some beautifully presented drinks with lots of garnish .
me being a beer drinker they had a decent selection .
pathetic inventory issues , they were out of most things by 9 on a friday night .
i 've been seeing this cluck n cup sign a lot lately on my drives home .
our server , jose was super nice and accommodating .
good service . reasonable prices .
all in all , a great , cheap $ 5 lunch fix !
we came twenty minutes before closing ( an act i was n't sure of , but i came in a group ) and the server was happy to have us .
i ordered extra spicy and it was very bland .
even with the discounted price , it was still pretty expensive .
good food for good price .
however , no beer menu . weird .
we got to experience a beautiful spring day , and it was way quieter outside than it was inside .
i also liked the ambiance inside .
i abhor intentional horrible customer service and frankly , i will take my firehouse subs patronizing elsewhere .
the restaurant was very clean .
the food is good but at what cost ?
service was bad . we waited an hour for our food .
staff was very friendly and responsive .
from the decor to the service to the atmosphere , everything was so charming .
the inside was not very clean as far as the window seals and the tables .
everything was luke-warm . the crust was n't crispy whatsoever , and the poppers must have come from a pretty depressed chicken as they were dry and boring .
the lights kept getting dimmer and dimmer so all of a sudden i was deaf and blind : p food is so-so .
mediocre . definitely not worth $ 29.99 .
nasty and weak margaritas that were being poured from a bucket . plain entrees .
now , i would highly encourage you to spend your money elsewhere .
the decor is beautiful though and it has a sweet back patio .
mediocre food and horrible customer service . coffee drinks are average at best .
the prices are very reasonable .
the atmosphere of the shop can be kind of awkward because of the bad lighting and awkward silences .
the atmosphere is actually pretty cool , tables in the middle , surrounded by different food vendors .
also the bathroom had torn wallpaper off the wall and the counters were not as clean .
drink selection is great .
bad food , small portions and bad service , why bother being open ?
the only reason i am giving them 2 stars is because the interior was visually interesting with exposed brick and the music was n't awful .
the beef was so nasty i had to take it all out of my ramen .
the food was bland and disappointing , as was the experience .
i really loved everything . i had sangria to drink and was happy with that too .
i usually love this place , the lady that normally works the counter is very friendly and has memorized my order now and she always lets me customize whatever it is i 'm ordering , i love that !
the food was unimpressive but on par for the price , which was $ 30 per person at the cheapest with the winter special menu . of course , given the product i would recommend against ordering the more expensive plates .
the service is spotty for sure . i suggest going and sitting at the bar whenever possible and do not go with a large party and expect to get taken care of properly .
i got the food and was so excited to eat it because it looked so good but it was just a dissatisfying taste .
this was super disappointing especially since i spend a few extra bucks for quality .
definitely an enjoyable atmosphere . they had a nice soundtrack and ambience with a quiet atmosphere .
malee 's is always very clean , the wait staff is very courteous and the service is outstanding .
it was just a very weird plate but i ended up putting them on my salad because i love warm veggies on a cold salad .
the staff is nice and were quick to respond when we asked for the pasta to be redone .
i ordered the katsuya original which was nice and crisp . only wish the sauce was served on the side cause within a few minutes the breading on the katsu became soggy .
in the end , price was decent .
ordered the crab & lobster rolls . i loved both but if i return i would order the lobster roll again .
very unique and different from other sushi restaurants .
it 's always a pleasure to dine here for a casual dinner out !
the only reason i go here is because they are the closest filipino store in my area .
could not finish it was so bad .
it was ok beer was not that great tasting you ca n't even buy a small glass of beer without buying a flight .
i normally do n't drink but the bartender convince me that their margarita are their signature .
very nice portions and a very decent price .
the prices were ok , but a little on the expensive not .
their brunch offerings are great as well .
big wong is a pretty nice place to get reasonably priced good food !
the pizza was delicious and i 'm craving another pizza & salad .
chicken dry , chinese food taste like crap .
beer and wine was unlimited , but they were serving only one type of beer .
the prices are lower than what you would expect from a decent sit-down place like this .
the black forest dessert is divine , and makes the perfect ending to your meal .
nothing fancy , just good food , reasonable prices , and fresh ingredients .
the new location is amazing . not only is it bigger , but the ceilings are high and it 's nice and cool !
price is medium high but you will get what you paid for .
i had the hot link sandwich and it was pretty dry . the only thing that saved it was a hint of bbq sauce and the onion straws .
i love this place !
just remember that tacos are normally more expensive , so when you tip , tip off of the normal price , not the tuesday bargain .
price is a bit high but fair for the quality and brand .
the iced tea was n't my favorite .
would 've liked to see some drafts but nonetheless , the bottled beer selection was great .
the place was pretty busy for a wednesday night .
is this a lack of service , food staff , or poor kitchen management with untrained so called `` chefs '' ?
i am so glad i chose to eat here on a stop in charlotte .
ordered off the specialty drink menu , and man they were good .
the wings are delicious as well .
beers were ok , but they were bottled beers , so it would be pretty difficult for them to ruin that .
the bartender was rude and did n't know anything about the beers on tap .
the ladies bathroom was very cold and smelled funny . the men 's room urinal was broken and the toilets were dirty .
the place in general attempts to be a little classy , but they have childish menu signs , place mats , and dated picture frames .
steak guy here and we 've been meaning to try this place outside patio connected to the restaurant is so pretty .
ca n't beat the price . good food .
the appetizers are all good as well .
and their lunch specials are super reasonable with prices from $ 5.95 to $ 6.25 for the items that have seafood in them .
beer selection was ok , food was ok , service was ok ( one of the draft beers the server was unsure of , i think there were only 4 on the list .
the fried plantains were a bit too overcooked ? it was a bit hard and too dry .
it 's annoying and distracting .
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
we were n't told that it when it was ordered , only when we went to pay .
i 'm not sure what the magic ingredient is to achieving a `` retro '' rather than `` old and neglected '' ambiance , but fresh floor tiles ( or , you know , something sensible like laminate ) and seat cushions that are not held together by duct tape would be a start .
my plate was n't so bad , but still mediocre .
example , my husband who was not wearing his glasses asked was the kosher dog good and the reply was `` it 's the only one we have '' .
when the food arrived it looked like a real nice stack of sliced meat , but i quickly discovered it only looked like a large portion because they had stacked a little bit of meat on a thick slice of bread .
we ordered the rigatoni and the noodles were cold and very hard . we also ordered the boudin balls and they were dry .
we got a bottle of the rose cava with some salad and flatbread .
there are heaters throughout the patio seating so if you go on a chilly night you can still enjoy dinner out there .
i like how the bar has two sides one full of pool tables and then you have the restaurant side that has the tables and booths .
anyhow we only waited 10-15 minutes but that 's arriving before 7pm for a party of 2. the place is honestly not fit for all those people waiting in line but i got ta give the waitresses a thumbs up for doing their best .
the pricing however is a little exaggerated .
this place left me feeling confused . it 's so beautiful and shiny , but so beautiful and shiny that it made me feel dirty and cheap .
made to order , family recipe thai with a lovely array of spices to kick your dish up 1-10 notches in heat and flavor .
we ordered a bottle of wine for $ 50 ( argentinian malbec - very light for a malbec ) , not too bad at all !
nice atmosphere and bar area .
granted , i did order chicken ( and i have yet to visit an upscale steakhouse who does n't serve bland , dry chicken ) .
food is really good for the price .
fast service , very nice and accommodating staff .
the beer menu was pretty weak . they did n't have much on tap and the bottle selection was just as poor .
really awesome quality and very fair prices .
experience was over all uncomfortable . our waiter did not seem to have her head on straight , and kept forgetting things .
it 's actually more expensive than you think .
anyone can throw a high grade piece of meat on the grill and make it taste good but a good chef can make something boring like spinach taste spectacular .
also , their prices are high .
place was clean except the men 's washroom ... the ceiling was leaking and water was dripping everywhere .
no cheap statues or posters hanging on the wall that are supposed to give you the hint you 're in another world .
also a one off thing but the overhead light on the table was like a 10k watt surgical spotlight . it actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright .
the tortilla soup totally looked and tasted like fish not chicken . the meat was flaky and had the taste and consistency of fish .
great vibe and decor although the lighting was so dim it caused eye strain and dried out my contacts .
it comes with a free hot drink ! its $ 1 extra to change it to a small cold drink , or $ 2 extra to change it to a special large drink .
table was dirty and the waiter had attitude when i asked for it to be cleaned .
it was cold and bland .
the blend of sauces is the perfect balance between sweet and salty .
food is okay , but catfish burger is not bad at all . paid $ 13.99 is below average in nearby buffet restaurants .
people , food and presentation are great . good value .
we shared the goat cheese app , the salmon salad and the steak entree . all of the items were creative and the ingredients were top notch .
the decor was a little dated and outright weird to say the least .
incredible food and decent prices .
so friendly , knowledgeable , funny , & witty .
this place is absolutely amazing and if you can score a place on the patio , the views of the bellagio water show are to die for . the food is amazing .
i love that they offer veggie meats .
i drank the tasteless overpriced drink and switched to beer .
i 'm not usually a fan of casinos however this was the only option that was not a buffett or $ $ $ $ expensive restaurant , so for a quick bit , this was it .
beer selection good but server had no clue .
cute restaurant . nice and clean .
was disappointed , majority of it was just onion and hardly any corned beef .
you can chill , do work , and hang out with friends or bring a date very comfortably .
the only beer they had was budweiser .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
the bartender made a great drink and we were very happy with the food .
there was nothing bad about union chicken , it just was n't amazing .
not sure why people rave about the margaritas , i think they either have no tequila , or it 's severly watered down .
at times it can be too bland or too oily .
the wine was great , and the cocktails made very well .
the lunch special seems to be reasonably priced .
my faves are the bbq chicken , grilled salmon , and the steak salads . not in the mood for salads ?
i tried the only mole dish on the menu and i was very disappointed . maybe they do a better job with the standard `` mexican '' food ... but , the tortilla that came with my watery chicken mole was crusty around the edges and clearly not fresh .
the lamb kabobs we moist , cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth . very dis we ordered was out of this world .
but it was n't impressive enough to merit a cost of $ 16 .
prices were outrageous . service was decent .
the prices are reasonable .
i loved this place and wish we had one in austin .
i ordered a trio of tacos of steak , pork & chicken and i do n't know which one was my favorite !
not appetizing by looks or taste .
food was good and prices reasonable .
five stars for food . the sole reason for one star is the unappealing glaring cold fluorescent lighting in this place .
server was nice . helped us out with a couple recommendations .
the march madness deal does not exist as every miller lite we had was charged at full price . kind of a shock to pay $ 50 for one meal and 9 beers for two people .
the food came quickly ( which is why 2 instead of one star ) but the pretzel was ice cold , not freshly baked .
the band and hospitality was great though .
kind of comes off tacky .
taco al carbon was delicious and the green and tomatoes sauce were fresh .
i think this was the best part of the meal to be honest but still lacked a certain something .
delicious food , friendly service , scrumptious drinks ... my party of 5 loved this tapas bar .
the servings were large , spice level was perfect , and everything tasted fresh . servers were incredibly friendly .
it 's clean and the interior looks great with giant welcoming windows .
a bright colored rug / blanket hangs on the wall , drowning out notice of any other wall decor that might have been there .
also a spicy roll and beth having orange chicken which is great .
the meats were delicious .
avg . price around 45 $ -50 $ per person our dinner was a party of 4 and we only had 1 bottle of wine the bill after tax was around 300 $ you be the judge
if you are planning on spending most of your time on the strip , this hotel is a little far expect to spend about twelve bucks plus tip to get there .
i was drinking pimm 's cup and it was perfect and super refreshing .
the cavatelli & short rib had a unique flavor that was my winner of the evening .
i only paid 6 dollars and 75 cents and had way more than one meal .
lots of conversations , cell phone and in person , filled the air , with nothing to absorb all of the sound .
quick and delicious . great customer service .
but i had a coupon from living social , it was $ 60 food but im only paying $ 30 .
wine was chilled and very good .
she was funny and complimented people on their song choices and performances , and did n't play favorites .
eggs tasteless , taylor tots hard and cold , just not good . very hungry and did not enjoy that at all .
we have traveled the world and this is our favorite restaurant .
too creepy for me .
the prices seem a little high .
happened to stop by for a late lunch right as happy hour started .
the only issue i had was that i felt the sashimi was cut a bit large so i split most of the pieces in 2 , but they were still delicious .
the staff is very attentive and they let you try different beers until you find something you like . the pizzas are extraordinary , and everybody who works here is helpful and hard working .
we ordered the nachos queso blanco and it was absolutely amazing . we also ordered the bbq pork cheese crisp , which was equally as delectable as the nachos .
however the beer was cold , and they had smithwick 's on tap .
i just started traveling into cleveland for work , and this place is .5 mile from my hotel . great fries , but even better subs !
free wifi also made it a nice little place to hang out .
the water was in a pitcher on the table and was warm and service was relatively slow , regardless of us being the only ones in the restaurant .
the menu is simple but the ingredients fresh and the presentation is wonderful . the decor is beautiful and their breads and pastries are delicious .
beer was awful and is n't even in a pint glass .
but they forgot bring soup ( ( ( prices little bit to high we spend $ 36 i think it 's little expensive for place like this .
there 's a bunch of seating and its a nice study spot .
we even had a visit from the chef , i think his name was matt , who stopped by to see if we were enjoying everything all in all a wonderful experience and we will definitely come back .
love the variety of seating selections ... high tops , comfortable booths , couches , a dart board ... good patio outside with torches ... pretty much has it all .
and those cheap drinks are also ridiculously small .
hot dishes were great and we loved the tempura .
they are all kind hard working people trying to do there jobs .
classic quebec mama resto , kind of like a casse croute but with more seating , a covered terasse , and a bar .
i did not finish my meal as i felt sick from it being so sweet .
positive aspects : the food is tasty and has an outdoor seating area .
unfortunately i did not like it and ordered a bottled domestic .
we had such a wonderful time , the staff was helpful and friendly but not intrusive .
we ordered our daiquiris and moscow mules ( free with a check-in on yelp ) and began to peruse the menu .
hardly anything fresh on the menu .
our wait staff was wonderful and friendly .
it 's a little awkward .
great plates and delicious gyros , the meat is always tender and delicious . i love their chicken shwarma and beef kabobs
they had a good selection of beers and something i 'd never seen before , jameson on tap . i 'm very curious as to how liquor on tap works ( and why a mexican restaurant had whiskey on tap instead of tequila ) but we did n't have the time to stay and investigate .
i also liked how the kids menu offered a mix and match of items and included fresh , raw carrots in addition to the veggie of the day and the usual suspects of fries .
the salmon was awfully fishy and my husband 's dish was just `` meh '' .
i would say it 's on par with denny 's , and not something i was happy paying $ 9.50 for .
minor minuses : i did n't love the decor , i wanted it to be more dimly lit and more cozy some how .
we also got a fruity rum cocktail that was pretty good too .
i love this place !
weather was perfect and the porch was awesome , but the heavy traffic less than 20 yards away was a huge nuisance .
i ordered the ribs , sweet potato fries , and the `` famous '' peach cobbler they offer . the meat was tender and i love the variety of sauces they offered .
the portion was just right . the acidity from the mustard sauce added a pleasant surprise and bread had a nice crisp to it .
nancy our server was so attentive and very knowledgeable to us new comers .
this place had some of the most filling an satisfying and delicious ramen ever .
the chicken itself is tender and flavorful , but the sauce is unbelievable !
it was cooked so perfectly , medium rare , exactly as ordered and was by far the most succulent lamb i 've eaten in a while .
awesome addition to this great neighborhood .
my coworker recommended this place and i am sure glad that she did .
if i return to las vegas , i will surely return here .
room was nice , but expected more . hallway was dirty , bathroom ceiling had hair stuck to it , ( gross ) , no coffee maker or refrigerator .
its a small dining room in need of some tlc ( did n't appear dirty , but decoration wise ) .
we came in on a friday night to be told that they only had one table left . it took the hostess a good 10 minutes to find the table .
service was great . price is steep , but good food ai n't cheap .
this is a review for the to-go menu of serendipity . for those that are too cheap to pay a $ 15-20 dollar tab for serendipity 's dine in menu , there is an alternative , somewhat inexpensive to go menu .
great bar inside . real cheap and the atmosphere is that of a nice dive .
thank you carly , and you amazing team !
we had a total bust on the coconut margarita pitcher we ordered .
it 's just an awkward setup .
when i told the waitress i was n't happy with the food , she stomped off like i insulted her . it was n't her fault and she had to reason to get mad .
the pricing is good .
very reasonably priced as well .
the crust was delicious and the toppings were very very plentiful .
also , good selection of beer , 15 tap beers and about that many in a bottle .
we got horrible service before we even got sat .
good drinks and drink selection .
price was cheap and service was good .
i had a blackberry cocktail it was strong and good .
and the restaurant was clean but the manager was an idiot .
the al pastor tacos had tasty flavor , the bean and cheese burrito was yummy , and the cheese quesadilla was great !
my friend and i both agreed that the dining room feels overdone , so we were happy to sit outside to people watch .
my cocktail was great but it was a bit strong .
we had our aqua panna to start and then the waitor who was super sweet and funny recommended i get a peach bellini and it was amazing tasted like pureed peach with champagne .
1/2 off steaks ( and a gnocchi i just could n't pass up ) the vibe is straight up sexy , ( i never use that word because i feel awkward saying it out loud ) but its just dark , sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie .
it 's still creepy .
they have nice clean vibe inside .
very little sausage and the cheese was bland and not melted .
the roasted pork with mushrooms was incredibly tender .
but more importantly the prices were unbeatable
the elephant garlic appetizer is still decent but most everything else has changed for the worse .
that 's a pretty damn good price for a homecooked meal .
the food is mediocre and not worth it for the price .
drinks were great . had the ms paloma and their twist on a margarita .
he did nothing to make us feel welcome and was scarce most of the night except when it was time for the check .
this pizza is good , but why do i always walk out with a $ 70 tab for 2 people , for pizza . come on !
lazy lazy lazy employees , does n't matter what time i come thru the drive thru to eat , it 's your job to provide service . simply said that the system is down it will be 30-40 mins when i clearly saw you ring someone else up
i also love the tropical iced tea and cheeky servers tees .
i just walked out . and was n't surprised when no one acknowledged me leaving either .
the hours are incredible with it closing at 1:30 am on most nights .
beer selection was horrible ( typical of canada ) and on top of that they were out of the one beer that 's barely drinkable . wine selection was nearly as bad .
endless supply of mixers and top shelf bottles ! great service , except it is possible one of our waitresses was a bit tipsy at the end of the night ... .
tab for a single and yes , cold beer , one soda , two waters , 4 burgers was north of $ 80 .
prices are too high and happy hour is n't the best .
the house margarita was n't bad either .
not many beers on tap , but what they had were pretty good .
the place is small and cozy .
the ice cream was good , but i 'm assuming it was store bought .
things like the establishment being too loud or having `` outdated decor '' wo n't ruin my meal .
however they offer a happy hour on well drinks and draft beers but their draft beer wasnt working and they dont offer bottles in substitution so that was kind of disappointing .
the restaurant had a very nice and functional layout with ample seating both indoors and outdoors .
small price to pay for great food .
getting water refills was hard and the place was n't packed either .
my husband and i shared the half roasted chicken with rice and beans and plantains .
the owner does not even talk to the customers only too a few not like at the beginning .
had some drinks at the bar : good basil cocktail and firebird red wine is pretty good .
$ 17 house plain margarita in a short glass filled to the brine with ice for $ 14 was a rip off .
the food was good , i thought my meal was heavy on the sauce but thats a preference thing and nothing to do with quality .
we ordered beers and were served some beer cocktail they were n't bad but i just wanted the beer not a cocktail .
unfortunately , i do n't drink beer .
the food was awesome ! i had a taco flight of 3 different assorted tacos ... carnitas , carne asada and the waitresses favorite the grilled salmon ... my husband got the burrito bowl of some sort with a fried egg on top .
the berry sangria was a nice addition to the meal .
plenty of sauce to scoop up with their excellent naan too .
i understand your business will be backed up and busier than normal due to specials you have going on .
prices are very reasonable .
the atmosphere is calm and beautifully decorated .
the prices are very reasonable .
a great place to meet up with friends for a night out !
throw in a fantastic mix of herbs and spices , incredible waffle fries , a wide variety of condiments , and homemade lemonade , and you have yourself the most fantastic meal you 'll ever get at a fast food establishment .
the prices are reasonable . the atmosphere is great too .
i never tried the grilled fish , but it does n't seem as appetizing as the fried ones .
that would justify the somewhat high pricing .
the food is decent but overpriced .
you will not be disappointed .
the attempt of the physical environment ( possibly artsy ? )
the lasagna was pretty good , except the tomato sauce was a bit too sour and overpowering .
the only thing soaking up the sound is people 's clothes .
the greatest sushi ever for a very cheap price ! the las vegas roll is my favorite !
only thing to note is the dark lighting in some parts of the restaurant .
they poured hefty servings of glenlivet 12 and their crescent crush house cocktail - their take on a greyhound - and served in a pint glass was dangerously delicious .
for 4 people , a sandwich and a soup and a drink each it was 70 $ so over priced , not great either .
pretty good $ 10 spent on dessert .
i could n't help but notice the beautiful metallic paint on the walls .
i thoroughly enjoyed our quick stop at the gem when i was in town for miss evelyn 's awesome yelp events .
although we did n't try a margarita , they do have a pretty good beer selection .
love coming here for coffee and meetings .
in fact he acted like i was being ridiculous in asking for a refund .
the prices are n't crazy expensive and the portions are huge .
prices are pretty high , but you get what you pay for .
this is the perfect place for one of my fave comfort foods : shrimp wonton soup !
they 've got a good selection of appetizers ( order the meatballs ) and the wine was great . michael is very knowledgeable about wine .
also we tried to order dos equis on draft but there was something wrong with the tap that made it taste like a completely different beer .
no stories , no wacky convo 's , no random encounters with strangers .
excellent chef , great service , and a cozy beautiful atmosphere .
normally i love this place !
the potatoes it came with had some nice crispy parts but were overall bland and flavorless as well .
the only downside to this place was that we waited quite awhile for our food to come ( around 30 minutes ) .
that 's cool - unless you write `` freaky fast '' all over your walls ; - )
they did n't have any beer on tap , only select few bottles which was disappointing .
our drinks were bomb . they pear mojito was delicious .
they have a nice beer & wine list as well as some wonderful cocktails !
reasonably priced for great quality .
cool atmosphere but charging $ 18 for literally 2 shots of vodka ? come on .
so glad we did !
i did n't order any beer or cocktails , but looked like a great selection of beer .
service was excellent and they were able to provide good recommendations according to your taste for alcohol .
the pork and brisket were okay . the chicken was disappointing and a little gummy .
they probably only have about 300 of the 600 or so beers advertised , but who cares .
nothing special . ok for a couple beers .
the cost of approximately $ 20 for a sandwich and side is a bit high but maybe not out of line for a downtown location .
even if you 're the only one there you 'll be waiting a good 15 minutes . i understand quality food takes longer than two minutes to make , but the stand is outrageously long .
our server was very attentive , and the atmosphere is excellent . overall a very nice mexican restaurant !
freshest ingredients and completely original flavor combinations .
we only live five minutes from here and even tried to re-heat in the oven on a stone but it was still mushy and soggy . why ?
for lunch it was approximately $ 50 per person including alcohol which was very reasonable .
they have dining areas and lovely fireplaces .
anyway , the food was very good and quite reasonably priced .
the workers here are terrible , and the service is so slow . the food is outrageously expensive , and you get terrible service and quality .
i was disappointed , the salad tasted like lemon and was n't very flavorful , the chicken was dry and the steak was ok. it was very crowded and everyone was really on top of one another and it was loud .
what is really sad is that i would probably have paid $ 124 for the room without thinking twice .
i mean , what was in that deep fried meat in my sushi ?
rolls were dried up .
i highly recommend going here if you 've never been !
love the chicken feet and some sort of shrimp dumplings !
the cost is on the high side for a breakfast but again , you 're paying for atmosphere as well .
there was nothing bad about the service she provided as she did her job efficiently .
my two favorite items on their menu is the chicken caesar pizza and the sausage and caramelized onions pizza .
very poor customer service every time !
beer selection through the roof . not a full bar though , just beer and wine .
beautiful view of the street performers and delicious food and cocktails .
unfortunately it was pricey for the quality . it cost $ 11.75 .
at $ 1.99 for 4 , they 're also a wonderful cheap eat .
the only downfall for me is the pricing is a bit high for the passes and party pricing seems a bit outrageous as well . food is really good quality and priced fairly .
it was great . the cobb salad was very good , too .
totally authentic , delicious and affordable . try the flan .
for the expensive price of their pizzas , i would hope for better service .
needless to say , two bites and i was done .
we got wine and beer , they have a good selection of drafts and bottles if you like beer .
i understand customer service and catering to patrons , but there were people in line behind us .
the decor is tacky , the waitstaff tired , and the food dreadful .
they also feel higher quality . no more expensive pizza !
i 'm glad we tried chelsea 's kitchen , and i 'll be back many more times for their great food at reasonable prices , all with friendly service and in a cool atmosphere .
it 's supposed to be `` high-class '' but it has framed sports pictures , women in bikinis and obnoxiously loud lettering all over the place at random .
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
dinner was overpriced in addition to being awful . the veal marsala was tough and lacking in flavor , the pork tenderloin special was tough and flavorless , the only green in the pesto was the parsley on top .
good daily specials for lunch and excellent portion for the price you pay . service is also always spot on .
excellent food for cheap .
they updated their menu and took cocktails off the happy hour .
the lobster was delicious as was the lobster bisque .
it is the only mall with a real selection that is also very clean . the food is also an average price which is nice .
great chinese food that is very authentic and the prices are very reasonable , expect dishes around $ 6 and good sized portions .
great location , great options of beers , wines , and love the small menu of grilled cheeses ( which are delicious ) .
the interior is pretty cool and stylish , not too obnoxious and not a dive . cute little patio .
the restaurant was almost empty yet the servers were rude and inattentive - they obviously do n't care about tips .
just a bizarre design .
they only had a few beers on tap , and none that were particularly exciting .
good prices and deals .
he helped this experience be an amazing one despite the food being mediocre depending on what we bought .
reasonably cheap prices for what you get , too .
they have a pretty good beer list , though nothing on draft .
the creepy , outdated statues are n't not doing any favors for this place .
everyone we encountered was business like . not one of the employees we dealt with would look us in the eye and gave us only begrudging answers .
nothing is more than around $ 12 or $ 13 , and for the area , that 's rare . enjoy !
their lemonades and other fruity drinks are delicious too .
decor was clean and looked cool .
i ordered a chicken quesadilla . what i just got was a box of slop .
just posted a pic of their intimate patio !
definitely a good time .
beers were ok , but they were bottled beers , so it would be pretty difficult for them to ruin that .
dingy interior with bad lighting and unclean feeling does n't help this place out .
no one seems to know what they 're doing . disappointing
the area is dark and the only sign is one neon sign which says casino . the place is n't ablaze with lights .
i totally get that a business does n't want to have people abuse the ayce rules , but i highly doubt 2 little kids are going to eat them into bankruptcy .
i also dig the omelets including the avocado omelet with bacon and parmesan - so delicious - and the complimentary cornbread and apple butter served during weekend brunch .
the place is decorated with vintage books that you can read and the decor is adorable .
prices are reasonable and a good ambiance to boot .
you can stroll around the distillery district before/after dinner , especially when the christmas market comes alive with beautiful deco and lights .
nothing wowed me but nothing tasted bad either except for the fried tofu ( it was soft and chewy ) .
it was a little lackluster . it was bland and dry .
i ordered the mussamun curry , which is my favorite thai dish .
one of my favorite places to dine in scottsdale .
friday nights , music is way too loud and the crowd is pretty scary .
that is nothing but poor training by the restaurant 's management .
the bathroom was kind of dirty and there were n't any paper towels .
the lighting seemed to be pretty good , which is important to me .
the salsas were not good - more bland than anything . just okay
great service . came here after terrible service down the street .
wrong ! we had to sit and wait about 35min for our appetizer to come out and felt like another 45minutes before our entree to arrive .
the most disappointing thing though was that i could n't taste the tequila in my margarita and when i ordered two more shots to add the bartender got offended . would never recommend
really , the only thing i was n't a huge fan of was the one shrimp dish on the buffet ( which suffered from overcooked shrimp ) .
we shared a peppercorn caesar salad and the contrast between the hot kick of the peppercorns and the smooth , almost sweet dressing was fabulous .
the upholstery throws you back to bad decorating decisions of 1995. their decorator must 've thought floral seat covers and curtains would make a huge comeback ... .
we opted to try the specialty martini drinks , my favorite has to be the bee knees or the apple rose .
my experience was great ! i loved it .
price : the prices are very modest .
i would definitely try this restaurant again and recommend it to my friends : ) i hope they keep it up !
they have a full bar but i was more impressed with the 20 or so craft beers on tap .
i ordered what was supposed to be buffalo chicken dip and it was the consistency of mashed potatoes with about three pieces of shredded chicken present . i 'm pretty sure it was just a mixture of cream cheese and buffalo sauce .
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
the classic margarita was excellent as well , and it had a good amount of tequila !
the food was delicious .
the bathroom seemed a little weird , they were clean enough , the sink was a modern sloped design but they had old style folding towel dispensers .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
plus , it 's outdoors like most pete 's are , so it can be miserable in the summer , even with the misters .
it 's so clean inside .
we love brining people here .
good thing is it is cheap for a decent size burrito .
really good food , reasonable price .
the sticky bun was sweet but had that perfect bun consistency and was not dry at all ( price : $ 4 ) .
we stopped by here on a sunday for brunch and had a great time ! the food was delicious , the staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive , and i really enjoyed the live music .
i 've also had some really great drinks , the bartenders know how to pour a nice alcoholic beverage !
the decoration is pretty much random .
very friendly and knowledgeable bartender helping me , the nd fan before the asu game .
i have never dealt with an unpleasant staff member and their pick up orders are quick and hot when you receive them .
should have asked for the gochujang sauce on the side as it was a bit warm .
and they are priced reasonably cheap . for around $ 7 i get a good filling vegetarian lunch !
the restaurant was really nice . the booths are comfy and the lighting just right .
the prices are fair as well .
they are fresh and lightly sautéed , as well as the broccoli , zucchini , mushrooms and onions .
the food is not very good but there prices are very reasonable .
the mint lemonade is also a must . very refreshing !
great quality food with a cleveland twist !
my boyfriend and i can sit on the patio for hours , sipping on drinks , watching golfers and enjoying the birds and the scenery . the food is great as well .
they leave you to wait at the door for no good reason and basically ignore you even though clearly the have space to seat you right away .
i only even leave negative reviews when i feel an establishment really does not deserve a good rating .
the prices are also great .
drinks and food are reasonably priced . nothing special here .
the interior is very outdated and felt kind of dirty .
i ordered the corn fritters and potato wedges which were both very good . my friends had a chicken avocado sandwich and a deep dish pizza .
it was also cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor .
and plus the `` lifetime '' membership they use to give you only cost a dollar has now switched to $ 5 .
the price for the lunch menu is super fair , too .
the spicy edamame was delicious .
i 'm sorry but any place that is rude and inconsiderate enough to post no hours on their door , or online ... gets a bad review from me . the only thing i 'm offered is wasted time and gas .
service , food , drinks , wine - everything was great . again .
was n't the best pizza i 've ever had but it was very tasty and extremely filling .
they make the good crusty bread on the premise . the veggies in the banh mi are pickled and give a great crunch and flavor to the sandwich .
love the spot and all the people that work here .
the normal price of the gambler 's special is $ 9.99 but you get a $ 2.00 discount with the player 's card .
the crust is perfectly thin and chewy with crispy ends almost like wood fired but not burnt . the perfect amount of cheese adorns the top .
one kind of beer .
had anyone looked for the belongings the day before our guest would have picked them up on the way to the airport but no one was willing , so we asked for the manager and we were again told there is not a manager available .
$ 25.00 total for the two items , but easily enough food for 4 meals .
only received about $ 5.00 worth of food .
it was way over- spiced and tasted awful .
i generally like to order different items , but it was okay with me because i liked it too .
the place serves good food for a good price .
the ice cream is mediocre in my opinion .
i started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila .
random but the bathroom was clean .
such a great deal . i liked the martinis with lychee fruit in them , i had never tried lychee fruit before but it was sooo yummy , i must recommend .
sadly wo n't be returning .
( maybe it 's a kind of place that inspires calm conversations ? )
wayy too many lights , went blind while eating .
food is always fresh and the portions are huge .
that is unless you want to pay $ 10 for six wings or $ 15 for a mediocre burger .
on fri and saturdays they have the `` hip hop room '' but guys can only get in if they buy a bottle and it 's $ 450 a bottle one bottle required per every four people .
leopard print , glass block , neon , love it love it !
the lighting was pretty cool , though ( check out the pictures i snapped ) .
they have happy hour with a variety of drink and food specials .
the fountain is beautiful and def a must do .
not sure why some say the decor was upscale .
it 's just that the 5 $ special turns out to be around 7 $ .
this is a solid restaurant with a great take home menu . the butter chicken and naan are on point .
it has a great vibe , with two floors of seating .
the steak tartare was awful . the meat was way too fatty and it was under seasoned .
they have nightly entertainment and great drinks . bartenders are friendly and pour great drinks .
food was a little cold but did taste good .
tasty and cheap food .
the food is delicious and the service is amazing . the unique little plates that come with the normal 3 course dishes are a welcome surprise and the cotton candy dessert is so fun and exciting .
excellent food , cheap prices , no-frills atmosphere .
i went again just last night and our bartender was polite and engaging , got me my beer and rum and coke , and our happy hour apps .
the cheesecake was possibly the best i 've ever had .
the chicken was even super dry .
we really enjoyed our visit to true food kitchen .
the prices were reasonable .
the line was out the door and they had to stop taking orders bc they were behind ( they stopped taking orders for about 30 mins ) .
the food is great and also affordably priced .
pouring beer was not their strong point , either .
pretty good wine selection i guess , i 'm not a wine guy . not much of a beer selection for being a beer and wine bar .
however , the lamb chops dish stand up but not in the good way . tasteless and over price .
i think the $ 35 per person is justified .
future seems to offer a cool combination of hot meals , alcoholic beverages , desserts , coffee and tea .
not too bad for the $ 15 price .
great food , great service from crystal . the meatballs were fabulous , ravioli was great and their tomato basil soup was excellent .
they served us free champagne to start , which was a real treat .
i love this place !
the only negative is that i wish they had a larger selection of beer on tap . they had 7 beers on tap but they did have a huge selection of bottle beers .
we all enjoyed our drinks ; sidecar for our friend , cucumber something for the wife and i went with the margarita .
it was good and creamy , but the consistency was a bit thin and was already melting even though it was in the freezer .
pricing is very fair !
some things on the menu are better than others , but the ambiance is nice and the wifi works well .
the rooftop deck was a great time on a cool july evening .
the men 's bathroom was clean , though it was intimidating seeing a poster of the godfather woke i was peeing .
not a bad bar .
the lettuce was perfectly carved to make for terrific presentation as well as functional .
i was sick the rest of the day .
the place is at a good location and the outside seating is perfect for breakfast . i liked the crepes and coffee .
i finally took my first bite and it was soggy , i could n't even find the meat until i dug through all the lettuce and tomatoes .
nice , quaint , cozy environment inside .
nice food . terrible service .
decor was weird and oddly spacious ... in a way that indicated they did n't have enough money for more booths .
i am very picky about food & especially the quality of my baked goods .
amazing drinks as well .
it was outstanding , despite the $ 21 price tag for one four ounce crab cake .
this place is a good find if you late a poke fan .
will not return to this place because of the mediocre and way overpriced food .
food is meh , prices are good though . i usually just come here for the cheap beer .
the servers wear clean white uniforms but are tatted up with hipster hair and gauged ears , this is a weird but charming place to be .
my husband tried the sweet potato planks and enjoyed them .
past that , i can usually tolerate it bc the people are nice and helpful and the place is clean .
also the bathroom was kind of messy with paper towels strewn all over the floors .
rolando 's is my jam ! i love this place always open at the right time .
it 's a hipster coffee shop without the pretentious attitude . i 'm a fan .
my boyfriend and i ordered bottles of mgd beer , which is a pretty common beer .
house sake carafes were plentiful and plenty good enough for our purposes ( although they have an amazing sake list if you like higher end sake ) .
they obviously have high rent so the food is high priced .
the beer was decent and drinkable .
the kids menu is a bit more expensive than that of say , boston pizza but the quality and quantity of food is elevated significantly .
the first round of drinks were excellent .
only shining star was the decor .
the friend parmigiana was n't my favorite but i enjoyed everything else specially the calamari which was crunchy on the outside yet super soft in the inside .
excellent wine and food .
i waiting 35 minutes to get a drink ! , wtf , the waitress was complete lost i ask for another beer and she bring me the check lol , food was ok a little salt but was good .
the decor is a bit gaudy , but i 'm fairly certain that 's by design .
the house margarita was n't bad either .
their creamy cilantro dressing is amazing as well as their avocado salsa which i like to put on everything .
the bathroom is kind of scary .
one can of beer was the only alcohol .
it took them a really long time , but after that ordeal , he assured us that these things generally get resolved fairly . no chance .
makes me uncomfortable and i find it tacky .
its great that their open really late so you can always grab a late night meal !
i fully understand the restaurant is there to make money but when i can get a six pack 72 ounces of arrogant bastard milk stout beer for $ 7.99 but i have to pay $ 8 for a 8 ounce glass is kind of ridiculous .
we had a great experience and staff are great .
the spinach and artichoke dip tasted like cream cheese , bland boring nothingness cream cheese and it only came with 6 chips .
i do n't know if they are just lazy or if they are way under staffed but something needs to be done .
on top of that its expensive .
the interior is beautiful !
the decor is tired and worn but who cares ?
pbr is traditionally a country bar ; however the venue is also called the rock bar and plays hiphop music .
there 's room for improvement for kitchen staff . generally they food prices is not fair portion vs. price value .
you wo n't be disappointed !
that meal came with rolls - the only dissatisfying part .
they only had sapporo on tap . there is a pretty nice selection of bottled beers but they 're terribly overpriced for a bottle .
the architecture tripped me up a bit because i was afraid the ceiling was going to collapse .
great atmosphere . its hard to find places that are truly unique these days and this place its decor and theme is truly a one of a kind moment .
the food was really good here but they 're pretty expensive i think a 12 inch was like $ 13 and a 16 inch is like 17 dollars .
the girl at the register suddenly says in an angry tone , `` do n't take pictures here !
prices are also good .
the only reason for the 4 stars was because of the `` corny '' attire for the waitresses ... but some guys like the school girl look ( short plaid skirts ) .
just opened . i 'm always looking for somewhere healthy to eat and it 's not easy round here .
they had several beers on tap but not that amazing of a selection of bottled microbrews ( but enough that most people would be happy ) .
and the quality of the ingredients is excellent .
it was great to support a non-chain place .
a special shout out to marcie !
very reasonably priced for the amount of food that you get .
the only downside was the price .
all three times i went they gave us attitude ( made us wait like 20mins before making and order , rude ) and all we wanted to do was order some good takeout . such a shame for such good food but guess i have to go elsewhere to not be treated that way .
awesome drinks ( wine and dessert sake ) and great service ! pricey , but worth the treat !
also , this place is very reasonably priced .
i also tried the pork souvlaki , which i thought was going to be a heavy , pita dish but it was practically keto / super healthy !
not muddled properly , and it tasted like gin not rum ... .let 's try the nachos ... .hmmm canned guac , canned jalapeño , and add chicken that is cold and cut up from the night before . at least the spotted beer glasses are cold ... .
the real winner here are the drinks . the various fruit bellinis and sangrias are amazing .
i hate to do this to a restaurant with delicious food , but ... we had reservations for 815 , did n't sit down until 9. our table was given away twice to two other parties .
went here for a saturday night dinner with the family , the waiter was attentive but was n't sure if he was being overly sarcastic he just kept saying it was up to us and provided no opinion whatsoever .
the lighting was n't too bright or too dim , just right .
the good : fall of the none delicious bbq , nice flavor , great spice if u enjoy spice , mac and cheese is cheesy goodness , chicken is juicy and so flavorful , and ribs are the best in town beats buzz hands down .
place was clean except the men 's washroom ... the ceiling was leaking and water was dripping everywhere .
great local place for breakfast , especially if you live in the anthem / henderson area .
having quarters at a place that has video games , pool , and darts would be nice too .
bad service . bad attitudes .
i got the steak and eggs for brunch . after cutting through egg yolks , steak and chimchurri , the bottom of my plate was a watery mess , which caused my potatoes to get all soggy .
our food took about 40 minutes , and there were only two other people in the whole place .
we did n't have to wait too long , especially having dropped in without a reservation .
the service is friendly even when they 're jammed on a saturday morning rush .
we 've found a great new breakfast spot in summerlin .
it 's very distracting and weird .
the prices were reasonable .
our waitress was lovely , but the managers standing around were a tad flippant and rude .
drinks were on special for $ 5 and definitely worth it , i got a strawberry mojito that was really refreshing !
sorry , do n't feel comfortable giving 5 stars to a place with dirty floors and sinking ceilings .
marigold is a great place to meet for lunch .
the hash browns were soaked in butter and cooked with some short of pepper mix that tasted like crap .
we tried their specialty cocktails - endless summer was one delish !
only wished heineken was on tap , does have bottle tho .
the bathroom was nice and big , but the lighting could be better , it was kind of dark .
the study , the room we ate in , and it is perhaps a little more upscale in that they have their own bar , and their own `` secret '' cocktails .
the cheese was really bland as well .
super expensive and not necessarily fair trade ! a dirty chai will set you back about $ 5 for a 12 oz .
they have a three-course price fix lunch for only $ 29 and it was so worth it .
the ac was pretty loud though and the interior design looked a little out dated but it 's tolerable and not much of an eye sore .
the place just looks cool .
not food poisoning sick just that the fish was definitely not fresh .
food was good ( bit oversauced , but not terribly so ! )
it was also reasonably priced .
i was n't sure the reason why they wanted to do that .
the food was reasonably priced , but it certainly was n't cheap bbq .
you will not be disappointed .
we shared a pitcher of the house lemonade with basil , this was the perfect refreshing summer taste we were looking for to accompany our meal .
seafood hot pot was just ok. not enough seafood like other places and over cooked .
we plan to return but , jenni please turn down the garish annoying overhead lighting !
setting is comfortable and even romantic .
the wine list looked good from the peak i had at it , my friend ordered all three bottle of wine which were all fantastic , one of which was super pricey and i could n't tell a huge difference between that and the less expensive bottles .
a little pricey but very good food and beer . go there during happy hour and the prices are much more reasonable .
only thing that struck me as a little strange is the decor -- photos and descriptions up on the walls are a bit outdated and do not match the aesthetic of the restaurant .
i was on hd for so long , i arrived at the store and wired on line when she finally picked up .
pleased , but it should n't take 40 minutes to make nachos !
exceptional service . affordable and extensive wine list .
the prices are fair and i consider it a good value .
great place for the family to start the day .
outstanding food quality , and variety of choices , but not worth $ 44 per person . the $ 10 refillable house wine option sounds great , but with slow service i was lucky to flag down the server for 1 refill .
good luck , see you when i return to chandler !
the hostess was somewhat rude ( maybe too young ) , but the server and her helpers were awesome .
it 's totally faded .
service is very fast . staff is really nice .
beer was cold but all the mixed drinks had almost no alcohol .
i 'm willing to bet our margaritas had no tequila in them .
i am not happy about the service , the waitress seemed absent minded .
two sundays ago my wife ordered a christmas ale and the bartender offered a sugar cinnamon rim . she rimmed the glass with honey first ( awesome ! )
however , the price is outrageous for just fish .
my friends and i went for the wednesday half off wine night and enjoyed a nice bottle of wine for cheap .
the scripted hand to hand combat scene was a bit cool , but that 's it !
i live close to this location so i used to eat here pretty regularly .
the one thing i was not a huge fan of was the curry ketchup that they served .
the corn was an excellent accompaniment .
the bread was very dry , dehydrated , and crumbly . the bacon was also very dry and not flavorful at all .
his pork was super dry with no real smoky flavor to it . he did n't like the meat and i tried it- did n't like it either .
such a great vibe .
but as any other buffet , you get sick of it after 2 times .
the patio is much more charming than the inside of the pub .
the price is pretty good as well about 7 dollars per item .
and even though the hallways scream 1960s , i even liked the low ceilings because i 've never felt so tall .
if i 'm ever in town , i 'll be sure to pay a visit .
staff very friendly and welcoming . the food was great .
pretty good variety . good prices .
the wine list is really good as well .
there was not once a crack of a smile from our waitress , and her questions and instructions were super short , unfriendly , and awkward , for lack of a better word .
it 's really good especially for the price
well first time decent experience friendly staff but no one here 4 people behind the counter took 15 min just to make a sandwich .
the goat cheese and lemon flatbread was boring and we did n't even bother to finish it .
two stars instead of one because the hostess clearly felt bad .
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
the price is n't that cheap .
if there 's a wait , you can chill on the patio if it 's not too cold or head down to the basement for drinks - cozy rustic atmosphere with a lot of charm .
we went for the nhl finals and the place was packed , the patio is also amazing and the views are incredible .
cool little restaurant with more pick nic tables than seating .
i admit that $ 12 for ayce sushi , appetizers , and entrees is a great deal , but you get what you pay for ... average quality food .
i love the fact that i can visit and have a lovely small meal while sitting quietly and either reading a book or nyt , studying or chatting with friends in a cozy little room .
it was replaced with another draft beer that was n't that great either .
we sat on the patio right by the side walk and it was a nice day .
not sure about the decor .
decent pricing for their food as well .
my only complaint is that they have an upcharge for fried rice and it 's really only rice with soy sauce in it , at least that 's what it looked and tasted like .
chao has a happy hour from 11-6 with great drinks such as the lychee martini or the cantaloupe martini .
not dry or too greasy .
the food was amazing , but it took over 45 minutes to get it after placing my order .
i 'm a mojito aficionado and the bartender here makes a good one !
disappointing . beer was fine .
the only thing that really bugs me is the lighting . it gives me a funky feeling like things are dusty , and they might not be , but the tone of the lighting makes it seem that way .
the place is always super clean . the owner is super nice and great to work with .
prices are very reasonable .
the prices are decent , not too expensive but not cheap either - pretty reasonable for downtown toronto .
i gave up told my girlfriend how that did n't work by the cool and he did n't even notice .
the food is pretty typical of what you get in vegas prep aired to an average standard at an inflated price .
i understand the place was busy and all the tables were filled , but there were 2 waitresses , and then someone came from the kitchen and was helping .
fish is fresh and everything is great .
the ladies room was a disgrace . every stall was dirty , and the only stall with toilet paper was the one with the broken lock .
our wait staff was excellent , and i believe we 'll make this a regular saturday morning breakfast stop .
the food we got was good but did n't make up for the extremely pretentious wait staff who insisted we follow their process for ordering .
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
most of the meat was just the fatty pieces ; there were probably only a couple small chunks of beef .
cheap ok wines by the glass .
i try something different every time i 'm there .
it 's a cute restaurant set-up with sufficient seating capacity .
however the meat quality is even worse than any buffet we have been to .
had the accras , the plantain , the avocado salad , and the mac and cheese . everything was impeccable , the servers were super helpful and the drinks ( a dark and stormy , ti punch , and the house ginger beer ) was super flavourful and potent .
6 beers on tap and only one watered down version if a beer , so that 's a plus .
ate there twice n loved what i ate . the salads are great the cuban sandwich was delish !
it is quaint , and has an intimate , sort of romantic setting .
just seemed kinda shady . i suppose if we pay with cash , we might return .
but expected more from the food . thank goodness the drinks do n't lack alcohol : - )
we try to never miss . i get to enjoy a perfect burger everytime
the sandwiches are equally as good and are affordable at $ 3.50 each .
as we waited for our food we watched 3 different sets of people walk in and wait and then walk out because nobody ever greeted them or anything and they even had 2 open tables .
portions are huge so come hungry ! the hashes are fresh and made to order .
that was disappointing and seemed like a lack in customer service .
at $ 17 per entree ( with only one side , and a soup or salad ) a patron should reasonably expect better quality .
the interior of the restaurant is bland , needs some decor to brighten it up .
the place was ridiculously packed ... 20 minute wait to get a seat for 2. we sat down and looked at the menu , which looked awesome .
i told him we are vegetarians and you should be careful .
and it 's priced right .
food was good but i would say price is a bit expensive .
was supposed to be buffalo but they were dry .
they are a bit expensive , but the gyro was about 10 '' long for $ 9 .
basic as it gets . and the chicken is salty as if taste as it came out of a can .
this place was awesome .
everything was well balanced and light .
i was really disappointed to find the restaurant had no beers on tap , only bottles .
yes drinks are expensive ... .. $ 20 bucks per drink but hey its vegas and you are get to see a top dj for free ( well at least we did )
cheap and cheerful . quick service with decent quality at a low price .
it was very bland and quite disappointing . the broth was put in a separate to-go cup from the veggies and meat so nothing had flavor .
$ 2 for a beer is n't bad at all .
it was hugely disappointing . the broth was weak and almost tasteless .
the only not great thing was the margarita which seemed over-priced with a poor pour of tequila .
i did n't drink but i saw a good selection of their beer and a beer sampler that looked interesting .
i could not have created a more perfect treat for my taste buds .
only negative is the interior is a little `` blah '' .
for lunch i had the sweet and saucy sandwich , which is a combination of pulled pork and brisket .
( we ordered the 64 ounce monster drink ) overall a great place to stop by for some decent late night food .
i had the chicken marsala with mushroom risotto and it was delicious . i also really liked the salad with creamy garlic dressing .
fish is very fresh and delicious i especially like their fish tacos but beware their chipotle sauce is very , very hot .
the layout is kind of odd though .
the interior decoration is astonishing .
the chicken was nice and crispy and yet very moist .
they have reasonable prices .
yes , i had a good meal ( salad ) and a drink and it cost me $ 13 ?
this place was horrible .
also , the price is right .
prices are more than reasonable and service is good .
all 3 were delicious .
the decor was super outdated and dirty looking though , and the furniture was showing obvious signs of wear .
to make it worse , there were flies buzzing around me the entire time i was there .
they also have these things called garlic balls , they are so friggin delicious .
parking is a pain in the a** the escalator is kind of scary due to the sideways movement ... and they 're actually really ugly .
we grabbed some small desserts that they had ; my wife had the collagen chocolate pudding which my wife loved .
the sampler was a beautiful array of dry cooked meat that was in no way actually dry .
pretty decor , but we found the lighting odd .
amazing every time we go .
for $ 12 for 2 people price was n't bad but the food was bland . breakfast buffet is better .
good selection of beer , wine ... not at all .
i had the lamb and it was prepared perfectly .
beautiful decor and atmosphere .
unfortunately , i 'm allergic to seafood ( and other things ) so i ordered from the menu .
the food was really good . it was a little bit pricey for two people $ 30 .
horrible service . bad & worst experience at a bdubs .
i love the decor and the setting of this place !
and if you 're not willing to get rid of those lights or turn them off , put in warm bulbs -not cool .
the empanadas are fantastic ohmygod . shredded chicken is top notch .
this place is fantastic . they are very accommodating and friendly .
we had 3 different martini 's ( all great ! )
i looked around and only 5 tables had customers !
it 's pretty unassuming from outside , but what an amazing dining experience .
if it was n't for the enormous corkage fee of $ 55 , i 'd give it a five star .
you can eat a full meal at faustos for probably around $ 5 or $ 6 .
as far as price , we spend about 70 bucks between the two of us .
i noticed tequila behind the bar but did n't see any beer and am unaware of what the happy hour entails .
walking in and seeing different colored lights , a screen with images that changed such as faces and lips and white sheer drapes hanging , made it sexy and pretty .
also , the price is quite reasonable .
i was n't drinking but looked like a good beer selection .
i only wish the prices were a bit lower .
the bright lights of the place kept any sort of rowdiness down .
grilled calamari was n't all that impressive either .
they also offer a variety of hoagies that are sure to please , served on a massive portion of the best bread in the 'burgh - mancini 's , topped with freshly cut meats and veggies !
the service was quick and friendly . this is a great sports bar to grab a quick , affordable , and good meal in vegas !
then to top it off , the prices on our bill did n't match the menu prices ( two different kids meals were $ 1 more each and the bacon added to my sandwich was 25 cents more than the menu prices ) .
i was out in the area on monday of this week and had seen that this place had finally opened .
also got the shrimp dumplings and the salt-and-pepper prawns that were delicious .
kinda outdated ... but that adds to the appeal .
i noticed a decent beer selection but was disappointed to hear that they had no drink specials .
their attitudes are just plain terrible ! learn customer service !
each slice is $ 5.50 and with a drink our total came out to a little over $ 20 .
i love that they put it through the toaster so it 's hot and steamy and their tortillas are made fresh and incredible .
i do n't even care about the bright lighting or off decor ( or there lack of ) .
i loved the lobster bisque it had a nice big chunk of lobster in it .
the frozen margaritas ( strawberry , raspberry or peach ) are fantastic , and they 're half-priced during happy hour .
we really liked the atmosphere there . the bar was large & modern .
`` good food and prices for vegas '' of course , the food costs more than your neighborhood take-out but this is vegas and this restaurant is on the casino floor .
our server asked how everything was when we were pretty much done .
their pho was ok , my wife said it did n't really taste like pho but it was n't bland .
great food at a reasonable price .
the poor doorman had no clue what to do .
the bar was well stocked and the cocktails were well made . i had the rum based signature cocktail and was pleased by the taste .
i ordered another drink as the beer flight was hardly anything .
the ambiance itself is pretty basic , dare i say even sterile .
the service was horrible .
we asked if substitutions could be made on one of the speciality pizza 's and he said no but we could do the make our own .
hopefully soon also have a great wine list !
first time here and i enjoyed it .
the ugly : however bad the karaage don was , the ramen here was worse .
price is decent at about $ 10 for a 12-15 wings .
other than that it 's reasonably priced food , nothing special . drinks are good but pricey
there was a moment where we honestly thought the waitress forgot about us .
great place for families too , but get there by 5:30 if you are bringing the kiddos .
great job marina for bringing crepes to this wonderful little town .
great service and drinks .
the interior is a cool vibe .
i really do n't like the fluorescent lighting though . thats the only thing i would change .
awesome drinks and food .
we sat at the bar and started immediately on their enormous cocktails , i had the spiked strawberry lemonade it was very refreshing .
the floors were also dirty in the everywhere . the bathroom was disgusting too .
the chicken and the shrimps were ok tho .
beer was good too and they even had drinks even if do n't drink beer .
the value was there too , good prices for happy hour .
the portions are huge !
the pizza was disgusting so oily and the crust was extra thick . to top it off a greasy sausage .
it 's great tasting crust though : ) we love this pizza !
interior designer should be shot though - eclectic design that 's incredibly confused and close to distasteful .
each entree was over $ 18 , so it 's not cheap so get your act together !
the restaurant is on the lower level near a decorative pool and the outdoor terrace is beautiful !
the inside of the building is beautiful . absolutely stunning .
only how long it took to get the chili for another table .
and if any management happens to see this review ... .please know that this branch is in serious need of some training , guidance and better management .
lunch prices are very decent $ 10 with tax gives you a nice lunch .
loved the wide sauce selection .
i do n't know for certain if that was the truth because a manager never came over to talk to us or let us know what was happening .
super expensive for the quality they offer . their burger starts at $ 18 and the quality is n't matching the price at all !
burgers were dry and way too well done .
it was a miserable dining experience .
we loved it ! we loved the menu , we loved the service and we loved the food .
they do have alcohol but sadly , no full bar .
service was super friendly and quick .
when in charlotte kinda place ... . they have a really cool trendy , chic , atmosphere with a diverse menu and raw bar .
love this place . the patio in the summer is great !
i wish i remembered her name but i 'm pretty sure everyone there is great .
speaking about price , i think if they chop $ 1-2 on everything , it 'd be more reasonable .
the prices are reasonable , too .
it 's a little awkward .
the environment is very comfortable and relaxing .
great job guys , i 'll be back for sure , hungry for more .
this place is madness for sure in their service .
i told the server and she apologized and brought it to the kitchen and told me they 'd make me another one , i marked my burger before doing so to assure that 'd be the case .
the only comment i have that is negative is ... for 14 or $ 15 , the portion size is quite small .
the owners only want to get every dollar they can at the cost of your experience .
, but docked the restaurant a star for two reasons : 1. the lights are way too bright .
sorry guys , i wo n't order from here again .
the entire bathroom was filthy : no soap , no paper towels and the locks on the stalls are missing .
service was excellent and very quick even though it was a friday night .
it was very loud . the stained glass and pews were interesting , but the other random pictures on the walls did n't make sense .
this place was horrible . on top of all that the customer service was bad .
overall , it was pretty good for $ 13 on the strip .
music is always too loud to hear yourself think and they do n't show the games that every other bar is showing .
luckily , this brunch spot gave us a covered patio table , but i felt so sorry for all the patrons sitting inside , as it was dark and creepy in there considering it was 10am and a sunny day outside .
the employees are always friendly and funny .
not a fan of the color scheme or the lighting -- it just does n't give me that warm , fuzzy feeling i like in a neighborhood joint .
prices are just about right .
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
kind of gaudy ... stuck in the 1990 's .
the light show was nice and sat by the window .
it 's usually pretty crowded and loud which is n't super surprising .
the only thing that bums me out is that the place looks dirty , the walls the floors the ceiling , this place needs a serious deep cleaning .
our waiter was awesome very attentive to us .
nachos and no beer does not make me happy .
the prices are reasonable .
with so many new poke places opening up , this one is by far my favorite .
the pork chop was thick and juicy my father in law was pleased and shared bites with everyone .
the pasta portions are very generous and flavorful always pleased with the food and service
the restaurant ambiance and decor emulate her . it 's very inviting , spacious , elegant , yet also homey .
it was also honestly kind of tasteless .
lot of hot sauce to help cover the bland broth .
good job on turning the place around !
very expensive bland food stuff .
cocktails are good , bartenders are knowledgeable and will gladly make any drink for you .
very cozy , comfortable atmosphere .
to top it all off the walls were painted a really ugly color .
the room décor is elegant and their chairs very comfortable .
i had the austin tea which was not sweet tea flavored at all but i still drank it .
definitely come for a birthday , special occasions , and a date night .
but the fact that you have to go hunt for someone to get help was not good ... .
i 'm really happy this place is in town !
the prices are good too .
the lighting was a little bright for dinner but nothing to complain about .
supreme pizza and caesar salad were excellent .
the ambiance is nice and the food is reasonably priced .
it tasted weird honestly .
overall my waiter was nice and helpful , but not very attentive .
price is decent and is a nice atmosphere .
this place was absolutely amazing ! good lighting , intimate setting , and great food !
they only had three flavors of beer and all of them were unknown to a beer drinker .
the appetizers are always good and each are under $ 4.50 .
i ordered the chicken marsala and just as other reviewer 's have commented , it was definitely not homemade . the sauce definitely tasted like it came out of a jar and the potatoes tasted like they had been frozen and reheated .
we tried their wine , martinis , happy hour food , and dessert .
$ 9 for a cocktail at lunch , the pizza was only $ 8.75 .
everything on the menu is cooked to perfection , but it 's very rich .
the price is reasonable but deceptive so be careful .
while they were delicious , you only get four small ones which are hard to justify at $ 12 .
you can order the whole menu for under $ 300 and it easily feeds 15 people .
it 's a nice place to eat italian food with a cool vibe .
mind you my friend and i shared this drink and we were both pretty buzzed from it .
this one however seriously disappointed me : ( i ordered the chicken tortilla soup which was n't very good . chicken was dry .
the food is great and the portions are plentiful .
it 's so frustrating to pay $ 400 and not get what was included in your package .
that said , shame on you yelpers for being so damn high maintenance when going to what amounts to a burger counter .
$ 10 tax in per order is a little pricey but for frequent buyer you get 1 free for every 3 waffles purchased .
she is super friendly , and very competent . the atmosphere is very casual .
we were not fussy , rude , unpleasant , etc.. our bill was probably around $ 100 before tip .
first , let me tell you that they had some amazing cocktails and wine selection .
but he warned , i 'm pretty sure it 's basically margarita flavored beer .
the only unfortunate thing is the price per slice .
i felt sorry that she 's to work that day .
they were just awful and i do not think the tequila was patron .
people working here extremely nice . place was clean .
the service is terrible .
we waited about 15min for the food , which really felt like forever , but i guess is a rather reasonable time : s the second time , we ordered the fried calamari , hainanese chicken rice , and steamed sea bass .
the pork tenderloin was truly amazing .
the only reason why this place does n't get 5 stars is due to the fact that the lighting was very dark for my ambiance flavor .
their wine list is also great .
it 's huge and tasty .
juicy , flavorful , just amazing .
only reviewing the drinks here- expensive and the margarita tasted like there was n't any tequila in it .
but out of no where my friend and i dared to ask the barista for a glass of water . she looked at us with utter disgust and then just pointed to a jar of water with cups near by .
clean restaurant with friendly employees .
the walls have splatter of food , there is trash on the ground , stains on the ground , and it just looks dirty .
my boyfriend usually gets the veggie fajitas which are also pretty delicious .
the place is always clean and the staff is polite plus after you done you can walk around the mall and walk of the calories .
the quality is good in miku however i would argue to say that the price you pay for is more for the environment than anything else . understandably that rent is more expensive in the downtown area unfortunately .
staff is friendly and knowledgeable and eager to help you order from the unique menu .
the parking is always full but valet parking is a great option too . it is a trendy place & loud talking .
i am confused by the fact that a server walks around and says they will help you , because my experience is that they basically introduce themselves and then that 's it .
i 'm so comfortable in this place .
they look nothing like the picture . they look boring not appetizing at all .
love the look and feel of the decor . though the open trough sink and large communal bathroom was a bit of surprise .
i love what this place could become .
it was nothing special just orange juice . thought it was way over priced .
got the margherita pizza , which was delicious , along with some fried zucchini .
beer selection good but server had no clue .
the decor is nice , although i 'm a bit thrown off by faucets and bathroom theme .
the restaurant is more on the expensive side but value is there .
i said `` hi , there 's 2 of us '' and she said `` we 're full .
the service is atrocious , the servers and bar staff have such bad attitudes and are so rude .
a bit of a pain for bathroom and bar ( long lines ) . decor and lights were bad ass
that 's lousy when you pay $ 12 and $ 2 more for sweet potato fries and get a skimpy serving .
well the restaurant is very nice , but the bathroom disgusting , toilet paper all over the place , no air freshener .
the honesty is refreshing for sure .
eating at durant 's is a great experience . you feel like you 're in a mafia film because of its history and decor .
so so happy this place has opened not far from our place !
the chicken was also dry .
the menu and concept can be a little overwhelming for the first time customer so the staff is amazing in walking you through everything and explaining .
the result is an uncomfortable hour-long struggle to not slip off the `` stool '' onto the floor !
had a great experience ! the hostess was friendly , the waitress was great & the atmosphere of the place was awesome .
after paying over $ 7 for this plus $ 2 for a medium drink , i was not a happy camper .
the ceiling was leaking water , ventilation was crap , floors in the room were stained and nasty , and it 's a damn maze just to find your room .
the atmosphere is cool and trendy .
they do have a full bar but no beer on tap .
good prices . good food .
the selection was limited and the food was tasteless . all the hot food was cold .
maybe it 's the whimsical decorations that filled the interior .
i ca n't remember the name of the one i got but it was served in a giant sparkling clean pilsner glass .
beautiful mysterious decor which i later understood the mysterious because it used to be a funeral parlor .
maybe it 's not filthy - maybe it 's just the lighting and decor that makes it look like that way .
the decor in this location is trendy and gives you some cool items to look at .
the decor , probably lol
the decor was rustic and felt homey . i enjoyed the experience .
the wine we got was great ( see my pictures ) - very smooth - we ended up with 2 bottles .
they had a decent draft selection and everyone said the margaritas were pretty good .
prices were very reasonable .
but i 've never had a downright cold item .
they had several beers on tap but not that amazing of a selection of bottled microbrews ( but enough that most people would be happy ) .
pricing is also good !
the baja fish tacos and the fried chicken tacos are definitely my favorite . the guacamole is also very tasty and is around $ 6 .
my favourites are the lamb vindaloo and the saag paneer . the rice is lovely and he naan is always freshly made to order .
it was $ 6 and totally unsatisfying .
they do have specials everyday for a good price as well .
margarita tasted good , but was a little weak , i stuck to beer after having one .
we wandered around looking for someone for 10 minutes and finally someone came out and told us they would n't open until 11am .
great meal very good prices .
nothing fancy , cheery interior , decent food ... four stars .
my favorite starter is the q-rolls ; but who could resist a crispy eggroll stuff with their delicious and tender smoked brisket .
the bun had a nice texture : t had a nice `` chew '' and was not too soft so that it was falling apart around the burger while i ate it . this bun did a good job of staying together .
they offer you different type of sauces with it , oysters are clean and great quality .
the decor , probably lol
this place lives up to the hype . probably my favorite restaurant in toronto right now .
the woman and the manager were extremely rude and dismissed us simply because we had larger bags . i felt extremely judged by the staff and management as they turned us away .
it was nice a relaxing to sit on the couch and eating my food .
service staff was friendly and prompt . super pleased with our service today .
i would highly recommend this place !
good little spot for wine and appetizers especially during happy hour .
i was disappointed during my trip to wh .
we all ordered the signature drink the matilda wong ... .sweet and dangerous ... .very good but can be deadly !
i have to start with the service was horrible .
awesome . i am only bummed out that i will only be able to eat here every 3 years or so , as i live in michigan .
the place is so dark , all those light bulbs are making the room yellowish , wo n't advice you to check out the washroom either as its pretty horrible .
the floor was wet and dirty , and no tp or paper towels in the women 's room .
the layout is kind of odd though .
the sangria was good .
this place was fantastic !
i really love this place .
fantastic find on a hockey trip to scottsdale .
decor good . ambience good .
crazy looking at the old guy crossing the delaware .
it was ridiculous prices , but thats vegas i guess .
in the peak hours , expect to stand in a corner or possibly share a table where others may be waiting for to go orders .
the restaurant was really tiny , the service was fast & the food came out quickly , but the pork was really weird that came in the ramen . the noodles were good , & so was the fried rice .
i got a side of carrots , which sounded sorta boring , but i was trying to be healthy : ) .
creamy and delicious pasta and shrimp with fresh parmesan shredded on top .
after receiving our order i was shocked on how horrible it was ! chicken was dry and tasteless , salsas were watered down and coleslaw was just shredded cabbage more like a salad .
the place is cheap considering the area it is in .
i did n't taste a thing that was n't good .
everything on the menu is good .
only thing that struck me as a little strange is the decor -- photos and descriptions up on the walls are a bit outdated and do not match the aesthetic of the restaurant .
cozy indoor seating as well , tv 's included .
i would n't order the skewers again . shrimps were small , bland and dry .
i like the weird , cheap feel of the decor because it sends snooty people away .
not sure how or why this place is still in business .
the cous cous salad could not be salvaged . it was gummy and i was n't the only one that was pushing it around their plate , pretending to eat it .
the atmosphere of the place was comforting , and the staff were very friendly , and helpful .
awesome location . love the outdoor sitting area .
prices are really reasonable too . huge plus .
wait staff is efficient , yet attentive .
the met is a good place for happy hour drinks .
great restaurant and bar . full cocktail menu and extensive beer list .
very tired buildings and decor ( some patches and repairs make you go , hmm ? )
had 8 in our group , waited 5 or 10 minutes , quick service , sat us right away , waiter was great .
i eat here about once every two weeks and i am always happy that i went .
a glass of chardonnay and a glass of syrah paired nicely with the respective dishes .
prices are reasonable as well .
i had a porter and my wife had a peach cider . both beers had great taste to them and had perfect pours .
to top it off , the women 's bathroom was disgusting !
prices are very reasonable .
i do n't remember which draft beers i had , but i enjoyed them . looked like a good bottle selection as well .
rotisserie chicken was very moist , bread `` crumbs '' were fresh and crisp , pasta that came with hit was a little undercooked but i like al dente anyway : ) allergen warning : if you 're sensitive to dairy , tell waiter as there is a cheese sauce on this dish ( but it 's still excellent without it ) .
new sandwich offerings and the one i had ( pesto ) was fabulous . a consistently inviting vibe and another beautiful latte are making bad owl a stand out shop .
no alcohol this trip , but they do have a full bar , with 5 beers in tap .
yet the prices reflect more of a higher end fast food joint .
came here after the pool and it was a perfect fit for a real margarita ( after my wack one at the pool ) , a blood orange spiced margarita at that !
addicted to sake tuesday 's ! great food on happy hour .
he is very friendly , helpful and got us our food very quickly .
just one of the most outstanding pizzas i ever had .
the price of the cake is not expensive .
the prices are reasonable and the decor is nice .
they either have a ton of regulars , or the people that work here are just super friendly .
and the prices are great , not too spendy .
one kind of beer .
same great chili chicken and same awesome service .
it 's a sushi bar style so it 's tough for groups to have a conversation .
the price is relatively cheap .
enjoyed our time away from home .
my half chicken with was cooked and seasoned perfectly with sides of fried yucca and green beans .
their soups are very nice and filling .
the food was yum and authentic as well .
when you add in all of the tattoos , nose rings , ear discs and other face jewelry it just gives a trashy look to an otherwise beautiful restaurant .
love this place ! so glad it is in downtown concord .
worst food and customer service ever ... .. they try and change you for a large ice cream and give you a small.. they have done this more then once to us .
was n't expecting chicken at all - expected beef cheek or some kind of shreaded beef .
the chicken was tasteless on both meals .
he brought a bottle of champagne and was able to smooth things over .
would 've liked to see some drafts but nonetheless , the bottled beer selection was great .
their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers .
it 's the only spot i go to in az for my boba fix , and i 've certainly looked around a lot , and decided that this lollicup is it for me .
they work very hard and efficiently to guarantee top notch service . food is great .
do n't bother . the three draft beers our group tried were tasteless , even after we specified we prefer hoppy brews .
the grape salad side is a nice sweet treat .
then , when it came , it was so hot that she had to sit and look at it for a few minutes . luckily , we brought some applesauce for her to eat while sitting there .
the people here are really kind and attentive .
we dined on the patio that sits right next to the strip , overlooking the beautiful bellagio waterfront .
prices were reasonable and staff helpful and friendly .
beer was cold but all the mixed drinks had almost no alcohol .
the only reason we knew to enter was an employee happen to be outside .
but only thing i did n't like was the lighting , it seemed kinda dark .
the women 's bathroom was covered in pee . i stepped in it , and now my pants and shoes smell of someone 's nasty pee .
this is a great place for a date too , as the ambiance inside is awesome , mexican styled .
they run excellent half price specials .
price wise , i think they are pretty overpriced .
tons of vintage drinks served in big drink glasses and an awesome food menu .
i highly recommend the pineapple ad raisin tamales .
it was a delicious and very inexpensive lunch -- as a wednesday lunch special , everything cost just 8 bucks .
the worst part about that is if you call and complain , they make the driver pay you out of his tips which i 100 % do not agree with .
price was great for lunch .
i think it is a high school hangout .
it is pretty cheap and good for a quick lunch .
food & drink ( both alcoholic and nonalcoholic ) service in the theatre without a ridiculous service fee was nice .
miso soup is piping hot ( be careful ! )
i come back because the ladies pour a good whiskey & 7 and the wings are awesome .
they only have four beers on tap , everything else was bottles .
great place and i hope they succeed !
it 's extremely cheap in price .
i agree with others ... great concept , ambiance and decor .
the cocktail list is great as well !
our food came , and although the pizza looked good , it was just okay .
place does n't stand out as decor is plain and ugly .
the bathroom was beautiful and spotless but i 'll just say this : i hate bathroom attendants . that is all .
nice pool and spa with a great view of ceasar 's at sunset .
at a price point of $ 20 for the entrees , its a bit more that what you would normally spend on breakfast but for the quantity , the entrée is priced fairly .
the drink menu was impressive and the caipirinhas were amazing .
it 's so nice to sit out on the little patio courtyard at night under the lights and take in the view .
the interior is a little odd , and i think needs some changing ( think random pops of color and very cheap furniture ) .
the room was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful .
our first move was to order drinks - my wife 's sangria was particularly refreshing .
completely dry , i had to drench it in sauce to make it bearable .
i have lived in rocky river for almost two years now , and have been here even before i lived there and i have never been disappointed with the menu .
i highly suggest getting the sashimi if you want lighter fare ; the scallops were beyond compare !
she had quite an attitude so we let it slide and paid full price but will most likely not return .
lunch specials are a real good deal .
sorry , do n't feel comfortable giving 5 stars to a place with dirty floors and sinking ceilings .
that pretty much ruined the meal for me , although the potatoes were okay .
the food tasted bland and , like other reviewers here mentioned , they do not know how to cook a steak .
fans of the slow cooked dish will be sorely disappointed .
the cocktails were good but as we are not heavy drinkers they were a little too strong .
sadly i will not be returning here any more .
the lighting seemed quite dark to me , not sure if that is appropriate for a bbq joint .
at the bar the shots were puny but the beer was cold .
the bad : it 's so ghetto .
the men 's rest room was dirty .
poor lighting makes it difficult to read menu .
the place is set up rather awkward .
crust was mostly tasteless . still not awful .
prices here are pretty good .
service was good : ) have come here a couple of times now . always clean
it was dark in there , and usually good things happen at darkly lit , hip places ( err ... or bad things , depends on your skewed interpretations ) .
the ceiling was leaking water , ventilation was crap , floors in the room were stained and nasty , and it 's a damn maze just to find your room .
so if you want good food and you have a lot of time to kill for dinner , you must go try this place .
it was great that this opened very early for breakfast .
the food was simply exquisite and makes you discover new flavors and food combinations .
crust was very good , and the pizza had great flavor !
the drinks are stiff and delicious .
hummus is very good .
it was $ 12 for 6 oysters with special toppings . it was very average .
i 'm not a beer drinker , but they did have a full bar .
the unlimited beer/wine was nice , but there was only one craft beer on tap , which was disappointing .
the pre meal salad was weird .
bathroom was pretty dirty , soap was out of dispenser and just thrown up on the sink .
you have the option of a selection of great oven made pizzas that are thin crust .
not a bad bar .
it was pretty reasonable at $ 38 for three of us , but the food was denny 's quality at best .
also we spent 65 $ on two people , so pretty expensive .
i like district one for its unique atmosphere .
not a bad experience .
first off , the entrance is kind of awkward .
& goes `` you have to pay for it '' lol i just waived my receipt @ her & said `` i just got done paying for it you did n't give me my plate '' smh .
service was mediocre , waitress seemed more interested in helping out some friends than customers .
i think the interior is ugly .
as for the drinks : -after all , the bar was just calling out to me and although i had hoped to see more beers on tap , unfortunately , a majority of their beer list was bottled .
3 appies . corking fee was very expensive for our bottle of dom at $ 35- $ 40 ca n't really remember .
my family loves this place and we highly recommend .
prices are very reasonable .
it 's more like a cheers kind of bar .
the flavor was good , but it was way over cooked . the meat was tuff and chewy .
this place is nothing fancy , but it 's clean and the sushi is bargain priced in my opinion .
we had delicious drinks from the bar ( i ordered the cucumber mojito ) , and the food was awesome !
another rule is that you are only allowed 2 glasses of water and no more .
first time here and it 's a cute little breakfast lunch place that closes at 2pm .
this place is beautiful , bright and airy .
prices are also reasonable .
a bright shiny paint job and lighting improvement would go a long ways .
great place great service try the chicken fried rice the best i have had .
i would also say that at 27.00 dollars for a large pizza , it 's kinda pricey , but i would pay it once in a while to get that amazing taste .
seriously you can expect to pay $ 100 per person ( including tax , tip , and one drink ) for a $ 3 meal .
no draft beer - but they have a good bottle selection .
gross ... the only great thing about my meal was the chedder biscuits .
the shrimp was nothing less than delectable - perfectly cooked , plump and delicious . the fried rice and veggies likewise had amazing flavor .
they did not taste that good .
yeah it 's a little weird layout .
if you 're willing to pay $ 10 for a sandwich this is the place .
they gave us the nasty little parts of the chicken ( including cartilage and god knows what else ) , heavily battered them , and fried them - so each bite consisted of crunchy dough and oil .
very unfortunate i can not give patronage to this business . i think they 're longevity may be in question .
no idea where they get their furniture or frames or clocks , but it 's like walking into a different era and i 'd eat there more often just for their decor and furniture .
only reviewing the drinks here- expensive and the margarita tasted like there was n't any tequila in it .
the layout is kind of odd though .
chewy , bland , or just downright bad taste .
terrible . we spent 15 minutes waiting for a server to even notice us .
i highly recommend the sea scallops , they were cooked to perfection .
the food is unbeatable for the price , everything on menu is great . place is a total dive .
it was dark in there , and usually good things happen at darkly lit , hip places ( err ... or bad things , depends on your skewed interpretations ) .
the atmosphere is fun and people here have a good time . there 's live music and people are just happy and friendly .
it was a spontaneous choice of what to eat and we were n't disappointed but a downside was the price $ 30 + tax for 8 slices of pizza and one drink ?
i ordered another drink as the beer flight was hardly anything .
it 's not like this is some cheap cheap restaurant .
the architecture tripped me up a bit because i was afraid the ceiling was going to collapse .
their food tastes pretty good and the prices are decent . it 's small but the quality is there .
the food is good and prices are reasonable .
since it 's the summer , they had these huge windows wide open and it felt like you were apart of the outdoors .
he charged $ 10 for the rice , and $ 12 for two stews ( not a full serving just about a cup ) so $ 34 for an appetizer , super shady .
the unlimited beer/wine was nice , but there was only one craft beer on tap , which was disappointing .
the beer is cold and i have mixed drinks about feelings .
phenomenal ! i have also had the steak tenderloin with truffle mac and cheese which was terrific , as well .
they were high quality for about $ 12 each .
but i 'd be that person arguing with the people in philly about this very controversial topic .
only thing was the seating this time , i felt the lighting was terrible , like i was in an interrogation room .
some parts were good some parts were meh .
beer was just not good .
it 's also warmish , not cold which threw me off but still good .
it was nice that they had draft beer .
the decor and pink walls are pretty , but that 's about it .
we had a lovely late lunch here .
it is very good and reasonably priced .
we loved this place for brunch and will be returning again for sure .
a nice meal for a reasonable price .
she only had two tables but seemed to give the impression she had 15. had to ask for rice with my chicken .
the outdoor patio is kinda nice , sure could use a bath though , really sticky dirty tables .
all in all the pizza was good .
i will say that the drink selection was good and they had some good beers on tap .
no draft beers which was a bummer , but still a decent selection of bottled beers .
the decor here is really impressive ... love the graffiti art !
the food was surprisingly good ! there is a shrimp entree that comes with this delicious curry-like sauce and the steak salad was pretty good too .
it 's way sweet so it tastes like frozen sugar more than anything .
music was play overhead on speakers , it was nice .
hated paying a $ 100 bucks for a bad meal !
atmosphere here is intimate and homey .
the waiter did not bring up the fact that the cold drink would include an extra $ 0.75 .
the margaritas were so weak i 'm not sure they even had tequila .
the price of the food is very reasonable too ranging from $ 6.95 to 10.95 for main entrees .
the worst part about the dish was the price , $ 8 !
this has become my all time favorite place to eat in vegas . .. especially when friends from out of town are visiting because not only is the food delicious and the service great but if you sit on the patio you get the best view in town with the bellagio fountain show going off across the street and all the people watching you can do on the strip
a bottle of beer is $ 4.50 , which i think is pretty cheap for a place like this .
he has a great personality .
that is so desperate and tacky . not classy at all .
had an issue with my food order , waited one hour on the queue to speak to someone from a indian call centre and the person is absolutely ignorant and have no idea what the issue is or how to do their job !
it was slow but the service was ok and she was nice .
fake decor elements do n't make ambiance ( to me , anyway ) .
crap all over the floor , the restroom ( women 's ) was disgusting , really guys ?
with a price tag of $ 115 for the 2 of us we could have had a really nice dinner somewhere else .
do n't go to this restaurant unless you want a hole burnt through your pocket and rude service .
we went during the happy hour , so we got free chips and a drink .
the pancakes looked as good , if not better than the picture and tasted exactly as great as the description said they would .
i 've been passing this place for years and since i love thai food , i thought finally , a chance to try it out .
their live entertainment is amazing lounge singer , jazz , vegas style i always enjoy it .
careful though , their promo prices are with a player 's card and it is $ 1.00 for a to-go box .
i 'm open to going to this place again specially since there 's healthier options .
the brother in law eggs are very good and flavorful , some of the dishes have them included .
stand in line , wait for mediocre food and rude service , then stand in line again to pay . no thanks .
drinks are really good , i like the jade special , or almond milk tea iced or hot , for wings i like the salt and pepper or plain with a side of spicy terriyaki sauce . the pineapple fried rice is good at times sometimes theres not enough pineapple flavor but its good either way and also the house special udon .
prices are inexpensive and portions are decent though .
the margaritas and drinks are all very bland and watered down despite what they advertise as `` 1800 '' tequila .
unfortunately once when picking up a pizza this drunk woman showed up and was screaming that she 'd ordered an extra pizza and not making much sense .
good all around and fairly priced .
i guess they did n't want me to wait any longer so decided for me to not get a hot fresh meal .
they also make a very good dirty vodka martini .
that was really creepy !
ty to the crew and great atmosphere you give your customer
spring rolls were delish and perfectly constructed and the egg rolls had a nice meaty filling and good crunch .
the bartender was pretty bad .
la 's is delicious ! the restaurant is intimate and relaxing .
the food is vastly overpriced and the portions are smaller that i would expect .
decent prices for decent amount of food !
they charge top dollar for their cakes ... granted they are good but expensive .
it 's for sure a hidden gem .
i ordered for delivery the gyro with fries , ground beef kebab and sweet potato fries .
also , i know that it is the strip , but paying $ 17 for 2 slices and 1 beer is pretty ridiculous .
prices are very reasonable .
i ordered the ravioli , with fig , oyster and mushrooms and thought it was disappointing .
he may have been new , i 'm not sure .
the vibe of this place is very calm and comfy and the decor is very cool .
the dough was very good .
it was hot , crunchy , a little to much breading , the pieces were kind of tiny , but for $ 5 it was n't bad at all .
the value is also amazing for the price .
crispy chicken was super salty on the skin side , sauce was ok and the raw veg pairing did n't add much .
great place if you want to pay $ 13 for what tastes and looks like a frozen pizza .
greeted by a mirror maze and really sharp color scheme the ambiance has a lot more to be desired . dated !
4 stars only for the beers ( didnt try food - food was a bit $ $ $ ) .
they must need money so bad they are committed to this practice . it 's really unbelievable .
i had the # 3 which was two enchiladas with rice and beans . the tortillas were hard , cheese tasted spoiled and rice was cold .
the first drink they brought me was in a tall beer glass and was disgusting because it was premade syrupy , sugary margarita mix .
priced right with good value all around .
the service was excellent and it was a really pretty setting on the patio .
we ate at the buffet and the variety of entrees was amazing and the food was scrumptious . all the staff was extremely courteous .
their bread is also very nice and well seasoned .
it feels like you 're in an entirely different place and it 's so empty when you talk it just echoes really loudly and it 's awkward .
kitchen makes it way too hot to sit inside in the summer .
it was also super cheap .
this place had really good reviews so i decided to give it a try .
decor full bar , reminded me of a loft , plenty of seating area .
the result is an uncomfortable hour-long struggle to not slip off the `` stool '' onto the floor !
the place is attractive , but neither upscale nor particularly intimate though we required a flashlight to read the menus .
luckily , the waiter said since we were n't ordering any entrees , we could continue to order drinks from the bar .
come only for the food view and people watching
the sauce is extremely tasty and brings the flavor alive .
just left this place , which was mostly a ghost town inside ... however i sat for 10 mins before even being greeted . to make matters worse , once my drink order was finally taken which consisted of a cocktail and a water , i sat for 15 mins before i finally walked out .
the rooms at the renaissance phoenix are nice and the bedding is very comfy .
this was very reasonably priced at $ 7.45 .
fair prices and great food .
good for : coffee , tea , drinks
oh well , the bartender was kind enough to let me sample a few of the wines by the glass , their offering is fairly one dimensional but i found one that worked well .
decor was exotic and felt like stepping into a moroccan treasure .
first time at this restaurant and have to say very impressed !
nice fresh salad for lunch , a decent size for $ 7.25 .
a little expensive , however . but that is vegas for you .
the most annoying part of our experience was the lighting .
this is a good place for a dinner date . cantina 1511 boasts a great atmosphere , eye-catching decor , and romantic lighting .
good thing it is at a bar and i could get an ice cold draft beer .
great proportions of veggies and noodles in each soup . we also tried the chicken steak and egg on rice .
supposedly it had 3 different kinds of tequila , but i did n't even catch a buzz .
great service ! super friendly staff .
flash fried veggie appetizer was delicious .
i also had a glass of sangria , which was alright , but it was pretty sweet , and there was more fruit in the glass than drink .
lunch price is a very good deal .
my only concern is the lighting in this place ... i understand that the dim lighting adds to the ambiance , but for goodness sake , i felt like i had to feel my way through my meal .
the beer was good , but the margarita came with no more than an inch of the glass rim salted ( `` is n't that bartending 101 ?
pancakes were soggy and bland and the veggie omelete was chocked full of processed , cheese-like goo and assorted goodness straight out of a can .
paying $ 30 at the door , telling me there is a hour left , when it was only 10 minutes is ridiculous .
still ... 8 bucks for a bowl of noodles that cost less than a dollar to make is absurd .
she then continued to make excuses ( the cook can only make one sandwich at a time , usually people eating at cafes do n't want to wait , we should have told them that we wanted both of the sandwiches at the same time ... ) all of which were ridiculous .
i made reservations for 12 people and when i arrived , they said that they gave away the table because they did n't see my name on the list . when i questioned them , it turns out that they looked at the wrong day .
the bright lights of the place kept any sort of rowdiness down .
super oscars it 's great at noon , midnight , morning , dinner , anytime !
mushrooms were perfectly cooked , and the balance of the flavors was wonderful .
i told our server , not much in the way of `` opps '' or `` sorry '' & when the bill arrived , full price , no attempt to make it up to me . okay , i 'm done .
prices are n't cheap .
the flatbread pizzas are good for lunch . the pasta dishes are nothing special at all .
came the tortilla soup , because i had very good tortilla soup before , this one disappointed me it lacked intensity , spiciness , tartness , it just lacked fragrance .
that being said , i could n't help but feel bad for them .
i may be wrong but i thought spring rolls were not deep fried .
for is reasonable and also pretty good .
shots , beer all good but i did not their food .
i got my beer and i ordered dos equis but they brought another kind , but beer was beer and need beer in me .
- the drinks were pretty strong .
reasonably priced as well . also clean .
they had a decent draft selection and everyone said the margaritas were pretty good .
prices are reasonable as well .
very bland food , basically a take out place . they have beers listed on the menu board but they were out of drafts , out of modelo , and the corona was n't cold !
very very frustrating to stand for 2 hours right there in front of their desk and never get seated and watch smaller parties go ahead .
this taco bell would be great if they just fired the lady who lacks any knowledge of customer service .
beers were good ( even though they didnt have any beer specials ) ... hmmmm .
the service was great . our server was really funny , cheerful , and helpful .
beer selection was weak as well , and their bottle menu was inaccurate .
do not miss out you will love it here .
the brisket was my favorite . it was tender and moist .
when i received my salad , all i received was basically a bed of lettuce with a hard boiled egg , tomatoes , and cucumbers .
they 'll gladly take care of it however .
after such a bad experience you would think they would also cover the one glass of wine and pint of beer but nope !
the atmosphere is pleasant too with comfortable , casual seating .
even had room for dessert of a warm cinnamon roll that satisfied my sweet tooth .
the chicken was as dry as jerky and there was enough truffle oil to drown out all other flavors .
then just went to lunch there today and got a plate of boneless wings that were presented very badly ... sorry but i do n't want my hot flavored wings touching my not spicy wings .
the service was personal and attentive but not intrusive .
they have an awesome happy hour , our entire bill was about $ 70 and for great quality and quantity .
we sampled the beef jerky , crying baby tiger , chicken satay crab rolls golden pouches and pot stickers from the small plates and the banana chocolate beignet and mango rice desserts . highly recommended .
we notified the waitress and she said she would `` check right on it '' yet she took an order for a table of six and checked on another table before telling the manager our meal was wrong .
very good food at reasonable prices , plus it 's a byob .
on the other hand it was pretty cheap and pretty fast .
we ended up paying almost 200 canadian dollars for very average cafeteria food . service was generally good tho .
awesome food , a bit pricier than others in the area but you get what you pay for - - slightly higher quality .
the ambiance is really nice and relaxing .
we did n't want anything else , but liked that they asked .
dinner for 2 , a person can easily spend 60-70 $ during dinner time .
it was actually decent since they cut the fish thick .
keep up the good work lucky 's .
its exactly what every true fried chicken lover wants there chicken to be !
anyway , if you 're willing to wait for a really long time and put up with terrible customer service , i heard the food is really good .
the caesar for 2 was ridiculously overpriced , $ 17 per person , minimum 2 people .
this restaurant is great for watching sports & has enough room for large groups .
it does get rather loud in the restaurant due to a empty ceiling and can make having a conversation with someone rather difficult .
i 'm so happy there 's a location in vegas , love the ones in norcal !
the food quality was less than a denny 's and the price outrageous .
there were only about 4-5 customers in the whole restaurant .
it sadly was n't .
unfortunately it tasted like a pre-made dish that was nuked for my enjoyment , not great ( blackened chicken pasta btw ) .
you 'll have a great time .
completely ignoring us . when they finally came to take our order , they seemed shocked when we said we changed or mind and wanted the bill in stead .
the food was cold .
prices are really good , too .
- the meat was a bit dry . - the sauce was good , but not notably good .
ok , i do n't care about that so give me some decent food .
the menu is very reasonably priced .
although i do n't drink beer , i was impressed by their incredible selection of beer on tap .
inside is cute and they have great seating areas and books for children to read , unfortunately i hardly see any people in there .
great meal at a reasonable price .
measly meal for the price .
when our food came , we realized we were only given spoons .
however , i have already been three times this week because it 's closer than in-n-out and i 've been craving cheeseburgers lately .
salads were cold and pita was yummy . but oh my , the feta cheese tomato fries were the best !
run-down hotel , room is dirty ( there is a booger on the tissue box cover in the bathroom ) .
food and drinks : the drinks were delicious .
good place to bring a kid .
three of us had the salad topped with a good sized crab cake ; the side order of french fries was delicious ! the steak with frites also good .
i called after 2 hours of waiting only to find out they cancelled because they could n't find out address and did n't leave a message .
reasonable prices and drinks are not bad .
it was just certain bites here and there but i was n't prepared for it . still pretty good overall .
beans and rice were just there , nothing special .
i ordered the szechuan chicken on my visit and although the food is not extraordinary , it is an absolutely solid option .
i would like to update that the business owner reached out to me to apologise for my experience and even offered a free meal or a refund which i did n't expect .
i can take a place with an attitude and great food , i will not accept lousy service with poo food .
it 's classy but with sparkle ... if that makes sense hehe .
wish they had a late night take out spot or food truck .
it was free to get in and drinks were about $ 6 bucks .
there interior design is `` interesting '' , not sure why there so into the zebra print but to each their own .
prices were very reasonable .
the meal is only $ 9.50 and its impossible for me to even finish half in one sitting .
i have also heard really great things about their wine menu , so i ordered a glass of the hypothesis `` roots run deep '' cabernet sauvignon and it was one of the greatest glasses of wine i have ever had !
the were out of the wine i choose from the reserve list , but we found another great bottle .
that fire place offers a great feel on a cold day .
her pizza was good except the artichokes were very bland .
only wished heineken was on tap , does have bottle tho .
incredibly rude over the phone , unfriendly and not helpful at all .
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
lights too bright , turn them down somewhat .
but most importantly , the food was delish !
for alcohol it is just wine and one kind of beer .
the drinks were n't `` weak '' !
the prices are great .
for ppl wanting to socialize , it can be difficult with the music and staff shouting orders .
not sure who came up with the whacked cocktail menu but fortunately they have a good selection of craft beer on tap .
he explained the dishes we had questions about , made recommendations , kept our glasses full and helped us relax and enjoy the evening .
it looks like they painted the walls , slapped some mismatched kirkland 's crap on the walls and called it a restaurant .
both were delicious and fresh .
great selection and good prices .
it was gorgeous and we still only paid $ 30 bucks total .
cheapest breakfast on this end of the strip considering most the hotels at this end are way overpriced for very cheap food .
and the prices on that stuff are great .
the best sweet potato tots of my life . dip them in the honey mustard dressing equals amazing !
for those that are curious , they are doing a major remodeling and have demolished the courtyard rooms , so now there are only the tower rooms .
the staff was really kind in celebrating in singing at my daughters birthday dinner .
draft beer selection was not extensive , but they offered tastings ( poured more than fairly ) and the beers they had were really good .
after delivering coffee , the server disappeared for more than 20 minutes - he never took my order . he was n't busy ; he was at the cash , chatting with the only other server .
the prices are very high .
prices are very reasonable .
well the restaurant is very nice , but the bathroom disgusting , toilet paper all over the place , no air freshener .
the staff is really nice and considerate .
all this totaled out to $ 31 dollars ; not bad at all .
perfect combination of ingredients : pan seared salmon , arugula , pickled onion , bacon and a delicious sauce .
very good crab legs spicy garlic awesome food the corn is the best .. recommend to everybody .
the tuna salad could have used some salt and pepper . it was bland .
i was disappointed they did n't offer any beer on draft .
it taste very bland and like it had been sitting for a long time .
anyhow , good food for under $ 20 .
reasonable prices , love their chili , soups and even their salads are more than just lettuce .
waitress got annoyed when we asked her to take back to bar . she was def not great .
the salad was bland and you could get a way better salad at chipotle for cheaper .
we ordered baklava and not even that tasted good ; it was so soggy and mushy that neither of us could stomach eating it .
they were very bland to me .
we sampled there marinated chicken which was the moistest thing i have ever eaten .
the decor is pretty basic and they let people write on the walls .
our party of four split a $ 14 bottle of wine which gave each of us a pretty generous glass and it made it super cheap for us to enjoy a great glass of wine with dinner .
today 's waiter seemed angry .
the soup dumplings are fantastic !
prices are extremely reasonable .
i order catering a lot for my office and the peeps love rose city !
super pricey for a super let down !
the worst part was broken pieces of mussel shells were scattered throughout .
yes the crowd was older so he was playing to the crowd but unfortunately his selection in music was very poor .
not quite . i would totally avoid the sushi , as it was not fresh .
margaritas by the pitcher were very good . and strong .
we also ordered the blueberry cheesecake which was also very light .
good value for price . good lunch specials available .
service was outstanding - very attentive and fun .
bartender is great , drinks always perfection .
i hate them ; dark and ugly .
so disappointed . i used to love coming here .
the beer list was disappointing .
food here was delicious , however the management and host staff is horrendous .
strong drinks ( hurricane ) very tasty !
the fruit salad was the best part . the muesli was excellent
the biscuits were hard as a rock , the gravy had the consistency of water , and almost everything there was cold . the selection was poor at best .
while it was still tasty and had crispy crust , the crust was very thin and different from the regular mm crust i know and love .
we 've been here twice and tried six different dishes - it 's all different , savory , delicious .
the food is fine - greasy , somewhat bland .
good food , good atmosphere and friendly servers .
prices were pretty good too !
yes it 's outdated ; there 's no tablecloths or fine china .
good food . fair prices .
sadly the mojito was better than the beer .
and we were left to be served by the kitchen staff ... the only other table at the restaurant was also equally confused lol .
the staff ( except for one underwhelmed waitress who seemed quite irritated when we asked for drinks at the bar , what was that about ) have made me feel welcomed and comfortable .
very cheap for what you pay for .
he did n't apologize , or offer any way to make this right .
just had a late lunch here today .
definitely the go to spot in south side : never crazy but always a good crowd .
puke under tables , women 's bathroom horrible , smell , glasses in sink ... .
the restaurant has an absurdly tacky interior . a shame , really .
the only negative thing would be the parking situation .
the restaurant itself is beautiful !
a little fruity for me ( i 'm a bourbon drinker ) but i decided to try something different .
nearly $ 7 for basically equivalent size of a 6 inch at subway and that 's only the sandwich .
the gluten filled bread goodness is buttery crack that sets off all alarms in your brain that you are about to indulge in one delicious meal .
we arrived on a friday evening when there was live music in the adjacent courtyard , and were able to sit out on bin 702 's patio to take in the show .
very good selection and price range .
the drinks were creative and refreshing and the food was delicious .
the interior is drab and kind of depressing , and the food is kind of drab and depressing as well .
i recommend the set menus ; you wo n't be disappointed !
small restaurant with great food and incredibly friendly service . highly recommend checking it out
however there is the most sickening , stomach churning florescent lighting along the back wall .
thank you for making our anniversary such a special evening : )
the cover on weekend is mostly $ 5 though on some special event days , it is $ 10 .
we finally got seated outside and or waitress took 20 mins before she even got to us and keep in mind their was only three of seating outside .
the ambiance could be described as casual to romantic .
the atmosphere is n't bad with the dim lighting and all , but i could do without all the arizona nature porn on the wall .
i was n't impressed at how long it took to make one sandwich , considering i was one of two people waiting for their food .
so that is probably 1 star right there taken away .
beer was just not good .
the only complaint i have is that if your order the orange chicken ( or any similar kind of dish ) it is swimming in sauce .
while the servers seem nice enough , they just seem to be lacking in knowledge and customer service . this happens every time i go there , which signals a problem with the management rather than the servers themselves .
first , the decor - yes , it 's all about nacho libre with not only images of masked wrestlers on the walls , but the taps were masked too .
came here for a birthday breakfast after a recommendation from a friend . i 'm glad we came here .
soda was going flat , burger was sloppy , buns were flattened like sliced bread and it was barely warm after a 3 minute drive . also their fries were unbearably soggy and over salted ... i 've worked fast food before and at a dairy queen grill before , it does n't take much time or effort to keep a meal hot .
it 's clean and inviting , likely bustling in the warmer weather .
the floor is wood , the walls are stone and mortar , adorned with vintage decor ; and the ambiance is at once welcoming and intimate .
both dishes were not bad ( that 's what the 2 stars are for ) .
good little bar . it 's dark in there but food was great for bar food .
the 2 bottled beers were quite good though .
beers were ok , but they were bottled beers , so it would be pretty difficult for them to ruin that .
i never have to force myself to drink anything with tequila in it , but their house margarita just did n't taste right .
kind of cheapens it even though it 's kind of cute .
my go to is the salmon which is always done perfectly .
the only thing that was strange was that the salmon dish was suppose to be on a bed of pureed corn and no where does it say bbq sauce .
the restaurant itself is clean and has nice ambiance .
the prices were reasonable .
it tasted fresh , it was the right size , and not a over powering taste to it . the only bad thing about was that the pasta was was in long wide strips , so trying to get it on a fork was a little hard , but it was worth it .
the staff makes me smile which is always awesome .
none of the curries tasted ... right .
i ordered the seafood enchiladas , and they were terrible .
i had the lasagna . it had a hard layer of mystery meat on it .
you have at least 5 pools to choose from plus a whirlpool in a great pool complex .
great for groups . nice patio outside with fire too .
even the margaritas were bad ( pre-mixed ) .
this is a great place to stop by for a quick bite , either for lunch break or late night after party munchies .
the fish did n't taste very fresh and were very dry .
the bartenders brought me a new mimosa creation with each bottomless refill . loved it !
i pretty much stick to my beer basics so i ordered a corona bottle .
the staff seem friendly and attentive plus they have a nice systematic way of moving the line .
my dish was swimming in teriyaki sauce and had chicken instead of beef . my wife 's dish had barely any chicken and was also drowning in sauce .
my fish was way over cooked to the point of being dry and tuff , the shrimp was as well .
food , beer , wine etc was excellent .
love this location ! it is absolutely fantastic ambiance outside .
our food was great - soup and sandwich . the little round blueberry pie for dessert was extra special and delicious .
the quality and presentation are poor , especially when you pay $ 18 for one a la carte dish .
the food is delicious and authentic . the menu offers many choices .
the interior was very dull with pretty much no decor at all .
and for decent prices too !
fresh ingredients , very light , pita bread was nice and warm .
it 's a cute and quaint family owners pizza shop with comfortable seating and decor .
crazy . for $ 40 , anyone can do it .
great find , food and decent prices .
my friend had the pear martini and it was a very uniquely tasting drink !
this has become our new favourite breakfast place . the staff is very friendly and accommodating and always make you feel like you have come home for brunch .
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
i had the ahi tuna burger cooked as rare as it gets . the fish was fresh and melted in my mouth the slaw on the burger was a great contrast .
we went with wine over beer because they do not have beer on draft - there 's a large bottled beer selection but it would be nice if there were beers on draft .
tacky , but honestly , i think it 's amusing and gives it character .
the manager holly says oh maybe our filter was not clean i do n't know .
with the price of chicken and lamb offerings being the same , i always opted for the lamb .
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
the restaurant is not cheap $ 200+ for a party of 3 for what we ordered , by any standards and for the cost it should be much better in taste .
i had the grape leaves dolmas and bf had the lamb shank . i loved my dolmas !
simple , reasonably priced , excellent service .
other than that , the food has always been good and prompt , and the waitress are always friendly and attentive .
great service , good prices , and it was a nice clean place . the lunch specials for $ 5 are a great deal .
the interior is not bad .
terrible service from the manager and i wo n't be returning .
the fried mushrooms are coated with some weird crunchy cornmeal like substance that do nothing for them . i 'm not sure what kind of beef they use but the hamburgers do n't taste like meat .
the happy hour is one of my favorites and has proven to be a perfect girls ' night out with delicious fruity drinks !
i had a great time here .
they had a good selection of cocktails , we had sangria which was fruity and not too sweet .
i hesitated to come here only because i thought parking would be a problem , but it turns out that i need not have worried because they provide additional parking a short block away .
and most of all it 's reasonably priced .
rio 's world buffet is good , not great , and at around $ 25 after tax/tip for lunch per person , i think you 'll get the same quality at luxor or flamingo . i think buffet 's on the strip are all on par these days , so the only difference is the price .
i do , but was hoping for something that was more of a meatball - there are so many great meat substitutes that still taste like meat - not bread .
the price was about 22.50 sorta high for what you get .
finally after nearly forty five minutes we ask the waiter what 's going on - he tells us it will be out soon .
ambience is great , our bartender/server was fantastic .
the taxidermy on the wall and the open kitchen made the atmosphere very entertaining .
`` lady disposal can '' hanging off the stall wall , ghetto broken locks , auto flush button on the wall but not functional ... wow .
i love that combination .
waitress has attitude as well . no manager comes over .. waitress has not been by to say sorry .
the ambiance seems cool , it has good reviews , and it 's a block away .
it was not good and again another $ 12 .
the sake bombs come with a large bottle of kirin beer and a bottle of warm sake .
they need to change out some of their lightbulbs , as the dramatic lighting , despite being cool , was a bit sharp on the eye .
i 've eaten at a number of lebanese restaurants in the montreal area and i dare say this might be my new favorite .
they do n't serve hard alcohol but have beer and wine .
this is my new favorite spot .
wine choices by glass were a bit on the expensive side ... but they did give you a small carafe .
i believe i spent only $ 16 for me and my friend .
prices are still affordable and the food is good .
chips fresh with tasty salsa . i got the veggie enchiladas and they were fantastic .
the portions were really small and the food was just bland , even adding soy sauce could n't save the dish .
it 's a bit pricey for a hamburger for about $ 15 , but it was good !
pretty decent amount of food but no lunch specials .
the bartender was rude and did n't know anything about the beers on tap .
the restaurant was noisy and dark . service was decent .
i have never been satisfied with a single experience here .
food is so good and price is cheap for how much you get ! great quality and taste for an amazingly cheap price .
easy to speak with and great personalities .
no one liked any of the dishes we ordered .
$ 25 bucks off for every $ 250 spent ... it 's nice to be rewarded for being a loyal customer .
it 's never too loud , always simultaneously classy and laid back .
i personally think that $ 50 for lunch for three people that did n't order any alcohol is a pretty steep price to pay for medicore food .
unfortunately the red wine on tap was chilled which dulled the taste . the chardonnay on tap was better but tasted weak .
love this place . makes it easy to eat healthy on the go .
i had the 20 oz ribeye steak and a baked potato ; both were delicious .
menu is good . prices are fair for the strip .
the girls had skinny margaritas that came in what looked like `` toy '' glasses and had hardly any tequila .
prices are perhaps a bit on the high side , but you get what you pay for .
call ahead if you want to avoid having to wait out in the cold or the lines .
i even once tried a pretty awesome jalapeno margarita but honestly i would rather drink the beer .
the chicken tasted watered down with no flavor . the orange and teriyaki were ok nothing amazing though .
the place is located in the tallest building in pittsburgh , the steel tower , so it seems pretty fancy from the outside and when you walk in .
i was excited to come here , having been to other locations before and always having a good breakfast .
so glad we found this great little store !
reasonable prices and 5 minutes off the strip .
also the bathroom stinks and is kinda dirty .
the bulgogi ( chicken & beef ) are amazing !
portion sizes are very reasonable for sharing , considering most restaurants overload you with food .
the beer was cold , they have jameson and a tequila on draft and they serve tacos late .
i highly recommend this place .
the worst part was it cost $ 17 dollars for this salad .
i ordered the drink of the day and my boyfriend had a beer . the drink of the day was delicious and i was happy that they were n't stingy with the alcohol .
we also did n't appreciate her blaming her job for the poor service .
it 's also extremely family unfriendly to make us use one card for everyone or purchase separate packages . do n't understand the logic .
bad idea ! margaritas were ok but not booze in them !
the georgia drink and even the lemonade and sweet teas are great .
the restaurant itself is very modern and clean with pop music playing in the background .
portions are decently sized , no complaints there . also it 's affordable , with most crepes priced between $ 5- $ 9 .
i was warned ... `` do n't get fooled by the pretty colors and sparkly lights ! ''
great food and drinks !
for a 32 dollars pasta you would think that you get a good service ( i mean this pasta is a price of steak ) service is slow and mediocre for high priced restaurant .
the burgers were excellent . passion fruit iced tea was awesome .
price is very reasonable .
but the prices here are great , with most entrees & the ever popular mexican combos priced around $ 6 .
also , the egg drop soup was so thick it literally looked like snot dripping off the spoon . very unappetizing .
but hey , that 's part of its charm , right ?
i also ordered the shrimp and scallop risotto , it was a little bland for my taste .
the food is delicious and very reasonably priced .
tamales were awesome , that green sauce is excellent with the right amount of heat .
enjoy a glass of the complimentary cucumber water that is ice cold and plentiful .
food is pretty good for the price .
i had the hendricks cucumber martini which was very good .
had the burgers and they were excellent . service was fast , efficient and professional , shout out to jade , our server , she was fantastic !
the prices are reasonable .
1/2 off drinks for ladies which was really nice !
i have been coming here for years and i absolutely love the service as well as the food . its usually very quiet and quint , with friendly people that are enjoying their food .
the beer selection was decent for canned beers but the only had one brand on tap and the one i wanted was out .
they also seemed to have a decent selection of wine and beer .
we payed $ 29 for two and had unlimited access to pretty much everything .
i could 've given a 5 starts but the customer service was horrible .
sometimes overcrowded but it 's nice to sit outside .
the beer , wine and cocktail list is quite extensive and extremely reasonable during happy hour from 4-6pm .
it was about $ 16 which is a bit on the expensive side but the quality makes up for it .
their burgers are decent , but they charge you $ 2 more for cheese .
it was n't expensive at all and came to about $ 20/person .
a nice customer service reminder training would probably help .
the tables are clean and the interior is design with men wrestlers ( lucha libre ) . it comfortable ... the people were friendly .
the food portion is decent especially for the low price !
we paid $ 100 for 4 people on a groupon . after paying a $ 10/person `` upgrade '' for additional meat ( filet mignon and shrimp ) , $ 10/person for drinks , mandatory 18 % gratuity our total bill was $ 250 ... the quality of the salad bar was poor , with everything under plastic lids .
the potatoes were rubbery , the salad area had flies all over the place , and the desserts were still frozen . the shrimp had a weird after taste .
they prepared an all vegan tea tower with lettuce wraps , toast with a perfect pea spread , and their signature power muffins .
the woman gave me a condescending look and said `` that 's yours . '' i responded by saying that it was not my name and she replied `` yea , i typed it in wrong . ''
the only reason to come is to drink beer out of the schooner glasses but alas they only have crap beer on tap .
if you do n't feel like spending $ 13 - $ 15 , a cheaper but also delicious option from this restaurant would be the donburi for $ 10 .
they do have the good sense to put it on the side so your chicken does n't arrive in flaccid hot pink blobs .
rice in my burrito is very delicious , and so is the sauce .
the ambiance is great ; beautiful interior , good for both groups of friends or for a romantic night out . the patio is beautiful especially when the weather is nice .
they also make their drinks pretty strong !
it was nice that they had draft beer .
and very reasonably priced .
one note , i have read that the bathroom is dirty i have yet to find the men 's bathroom dirty .
prices are great for a lot of food .
one request that would totally make my day is adding pear schnapps to the drink menu , and it 's nothing like peach schnapps .
the food was reasonably priced , tasty and seemingly healthy .
i 'm removing a star for the price . we are up into very high end dining price range and that 's a bit extreme for a steakhouse .
the bacon cheeseburger was good , but as another yelper mentioned it was also overcooked .
worse food ever . i order a plate which was barely to see the chicken shawrma on top of rice and oily
they were made with a good vodka and lychee liquor with two lychee fruits on a skewer . they were strong and great !
the lighting was totally off - it was way too bright .
only hiccup was that i received my meal about 10 minutes before my dinner companion . i had to ask the waitress if we had been forgotten .
after about 15 minutes , the server passed by and was surprised we had n't gotten our food yet .
if you 're willing to spend $ 40+ a person for better food , then go elsewhere .
the prices were super cheap too : )
it was a huge disappointment .
staff is fast and friendly .
the staff is always friendly at the register , and the owner is a nice fellow .
it was a beautiful day out and i was glad they had tables outside .
having said that , it 's not a cheap meal by any stretch ( close to $ 10 each with tax ) and the pies are n't exactly huge .
though cooked nicely , i thought the mushrooms that came underneath the fish were tastier than the actual fish .
the decor was atrocious ( i would rather not have to look at a statue of a naked man while i am eating ) and the walls were covered in pictures of half-naked people and pin-up girls .
the beer list was pretty much all ipas , which i do n't like so i did n't drink from the beer list .
i got a black cherry mojito which was delicious .
food quality was poor for the price you pay .
the beer is cold and i have mixed drinks about feelings .
the beer was decent and drinkable .
service was five star , to bad for your resort fee not cool to pay $ 140 for a $ 100 value .
highly recommended by two who know good food and great service .
prices are very affordable and the food was great .
i originally came to el gordo to check out agave y aguacate but after waiting 15 minutes while the cook was chatting with someone who did n't look like she was ordering anything , i gave up .
it 's pretty steep . it was around 13 dollars with tax and it 's a bit much , i really wish it was at a reasonable price so i could get it more often .
we had a moderately priced bottle of wine and a dessert , both good .
you would think they would strive for quality and sadly i think that 's last .
everything was a reasonable price .
i took one bite of my taco and threw the plate away . food was cold and old .
i really could n't even taste the meat as i could only taste a fiery painful burn .
my waitress filled up my drink three times before my meal was over without even asking .
this place in my opinion is reasonably priced for a good amount of food .
the food was excellent , the best part of my meal was the sweet potato tots . they were both sweet and savory , but not too sweet .
my wife 's fish and chips were some of the best i 've had and my bbq chicken pizza was also great .
service is excellent , knowledgeable servers who can answer your questions and make suggestions .
the prices are reasonable if not cheap .
supposedly it had 3 different kinds of tequila , but i did n't even catch a buzz .
burgers are $ 9- $ 14 , you place your own orders and atmosphere is non-existent .
prices reflects the location and surroundings . expensive .
good people & drinks .
they were eager to know if she enjoyed it because no one ever asked .
the only thing is its rather pricey , so be prepared for a hefty tab . it is summerlin after all .
the had a wonderful crispy sear , but were perfectly cooked and moist . the sauce was very savory as well with great flavor .
not sure why the delay .
we ordered : ( 1 ) sin city tea & beer my grey goose l'orange , four fruit infused liquors , cranberry juice and sierra mist .
the food was good ( but i think this place should be $ $ $ instead of just $ $ because it was definitely on the pricier side ) .
the coffee drinks are great , and i 'm particularly a fan of the boozy affogato ( coffee w/ gelato w/ alcohol ! )
for starters ... the house mojitos with pineapple were spectacular .
they had a good selection of beers and something i 'd never seen before , jameson on tap . i 'm very curious as to how liquor on tap works ( and why a mexican restaurant had whiskey on tap instead of tequila ) but we did n't have the time to stay and investigate .
the first time i went to tottie 's it was for my favorite bear 's birthday party .
it was as delicious as it sounded and being a pesto lover , it made the pizza just perfect .
none of the food was like horrible.. but some of it did look horrible .
but it was n't , it did n't have any sauce on it and i was a bit concerned , but after taking one bite , i was sold on this no bbq sauce , bbq chicken .
good concept but inedible food .
the building was surprisingly large but very welcoming , with wonderful pottery and murals . the staff were helpful and humorous .
good quality , fresh and good prices .
the service was n't bad , but when i 'm spending $ 30- $ 50 per entree i expect a little more .
i do n't like eggs without adding ketchup and salt and pepper , but these cheese eggs were good without adding anything . the pancakes were delicious and had no complaints whatsoever .
everything was fantastic . ambience , service , music , food .
as a chicago native i was so excited when i learned that francesca 's had decided to open in the valley , especially since they are so close to home .
our server did n't come around for a good 10 minutes so we finally had to wave someone down so we could order .
the lighting was totally off - it was way too bright .
friendly staff ! literally everyone was cheery ( rare to find anywhere ) , knowledgeable and quick ( bussing tables ) .
every table was dirty , the floor was disgusting with trash and food everywhere , and the men 's toilet was overflowing all over the floor .
split a bottle of rose which we all loved .
the chicken and waffle dish is one of my favorites .
somewhat full bar not just beer and wine they do have liquor as well .
the chicken was kind of interesting and was good as a `` filler '' roll . the ikura and the saba was also average .
the attention , the sparkling sangria and tapas are great . highly recommend .
we had a $ 25 off coupon if you spend $ 35 or more , which is n't too hard to do in a vegas restaurant .
pricing is very reasonable .
you do n't even have time to ask for a fountain cup before they blurt your total and stick their hand out for payment .
we had margaritas and beer , and the beer was the only thing with any alchohol content .
the food is delicious and the plates are huge ! my husband and i shared the tractor driver combo and still could n't finish it !
good prices . good service .
we did n't drink , but it looked like they had 32 different beers on tap .
good drinks . and good prices .
the drink selection was so lame .
it is very nice , fun place to hang out , have drinks or dinner .
beer , old soggy fries and cold food , sticky ( ! )
the sangria tastes just like sparkling water with a hint of alcohol lol .
it was a warmer day and a corona sounded good , however , they had a decent craft beer selection and full bar .
cheap ok wines by the glass .
my friend had a salad that looked pretty much plain and basic - i would 've been disappointed to be eating that !
its definitely a local spot to visit the staff is nice and fast check it out
makes me uncomfortable and i find it tacky .
they recommend the queso and some awesome drinks ( kiwi , mango , house margs and the paloma ) .
`` sorry , all the tables are reserved . ''
beer and wine was unlimited , but they were serving only one type of beer .
very tired buildings and decor ( some patches and repairs make you go , hmm ? )
prices are very reasonable .
although this restaurant has amazing dishes , i started to notice the chicken in the chilli chicken had more crispy and crunchier pieces and some did n't even seem like proper chicken pieces . what a rip off and the fried rice had a burnt taste to it .
the restaurant itself is gorgeous with modern decor and outstanding views .
prices are reasonable if a bit high . food is decent .
we went to this location and was treated horrible !
i ordered another drink as the beer flight was hardly anything .
the house sake was delicious .
their tiger 's blood is my favorite flavor .
great atmosphere , prices , and quality .
that nasty smokers scent is ingrained into every piece of furniture , walls , rug , etc .
i 'm in love with their mango mojito ... fruity , but not too sweet .
i 'm so glad my friend suggested this restaurant because i 've been in this complex a dozen times and ca n't believe i totally missed it .
very reasonable prices as well .
many of the pieces were more batter than actual chicken .
everything was delicious , especially the fresh bread and salad that comes with .
great deal for the price and very tasty !
they have a fantastic bourbon selection ( my husband 's drinks of choice ) and delicious bloody mary 's for the rest of the family .
they have a full bar with decent selection of beers on tap , by the bottle and wine .
t-bones is a very attractive restaurant/bar that features music , quality service , and an elegant atmosphere .
the dishes presentation was nice and the food did arrive quickly , but the server for some reason could not remember to refill our drinks but was quick to give us the bill to pay and leave .
great atmosphere , clean , modern .
chicken salad - pretty plain , just a tiny bit of mayo and some lettuce turkey sandwich - i didnt try .
very bland , under cooked .
even one of the draft beers was bad !
both were very creamy and delicious .
and they have some good beers for the pitcher not .
the inside is decorated wonderfully - lots of color and interesting things to look at .
just perfect . design , layout , service and food we kind of amazing .
had the chalkboard portobello mushroom with veggies and spinach gargonzola ... ..it was delicious . with the salad it was a perfect meal .
the vibe is relaxed and the decor is fantastic .
i have been going here for about 3 years now . i love it .
we also got a carafe of coffee , which was very weak .
i thought the tap list was great even though i did n't have a beer .
neither of my beers were apparently classified for happy hour .
since i started eating here i have introduced more than a dozen of my friends and family to the food here and every single one has loved it .
the price was reasonable .
ridiculously massive portions , expensive , slow service , dirty , ugly environment with fluorescent lighting , and the food just was n't that good .
the hallmark is usually mediocre food for expensive prices . the prices are still expensive here but the quality of food allows you to justify the price .
the food was n't that great and the customer service was n't outstanding although delivering food to our table was at a decent pace with a few wrong orders .
for the price , you certainly get what you pay for .
the prices are ridiculously low and the food is outstanding .
this place is pretty good . do n't let the chipped paint on the walls make you think otherwise .
the prices for a chain restaurant with mediocre food at best are exorbitant and totally unjustified .
final price was just under $ 9 , which is n't awful but kinda expensive for what you get .
was expecting to feel sick from the chocolate but it was actually good in that respect .
it costs $ 36 but it is totally worth it , the amount of liquor in the drink you only need 1 !
it is an extremely thick cut -- a good 2 '' .
at first , i thought the price was expensive because it was in vegas and in vegas , a bottle water from starbucks costs $ 6 .
tried just about everything on the menu and always feel satisfied with the quality and portions .
this place is awesome !
super pricey martinis for the small pour .
they have a large amount of both indoor and outdoor seating , and the servers are very attentive .
it 's always exceptional food and service . all of the rolls and sushi are delicious !
thank you black men for providing great service and great cuisine !
wine tasting and teaching . good wine .
every employee i have been in concord tact with there has the worst attitude .
the staff is always nice .
only thing is that the bathroom there is kind of ghetto .
love this place and wish it was closer to home but i can see myself making a special trip to return .
good for cheap food .
such a great restaurant !
the restaurant itself is beautiful . very opulent .
to make matters worse , the wine portions were tiny for the price .
it 's a shame that the experience was so terrible because the food is quite good , but i ca n't imagine going back .
i do n't think they were intentionally loud , or any louder than any other hotel , just that the doors and walls were that thin .
but to describe it as a martini is off there was very little alcohol .
do yourself a favor and check it out . you will not be disappointed
not worth the $ $ $ $ ! room was decent , but not spectacular .
that immediately gives the feel of a gallery ( duh ) however the dominance of abstract paintings on that white background becomes overwhelming at a certain point to the point where your mind is begging for anything else .
i love when a place has great service and great food !
not sure if it was the side of the restaurant where we were in but i found the ambiance to be a bit depressing - the dim lighting , greyish walls ( with mysterious stains on them ) took away from my experience at the restaurant .
the only negative is that i wish they had a larger selection of beer on tap . they had 7 beers on tap but they did have a huge selection of bottle beers .
i got 2 drinks just a bud light and they charged me $ 10 .
first of this is a nice clean designed and simple looking place , it feels welcoming , open and inviting walking in there .
i had two tacos : pork and the vegetarian . the pork was insanely good !
i absolutely loved the atmosphere , especially the outside tables which were very romantic .
the portion were chincy for something that cost $ 8 . it tasted okay , nothing special .
decent food . good lunch price .
$ 12 for such a measly , mediocre tasting portion .
creative appetizers , craft beers and a nice wine selection help start a unique dining experience .
good pricing and good lunch specials as well .
eat it fast before the noodles get soggy and just order another bowl .
it 's cheap eats for high prices .
the layout is also completely awkward .
reasonable price and good quality .
the only negative thing i can say about toast is that for a weeknight , the parking situation sucks .
the service from everyone here was great .
the pub burger was tasteless and not that hot .
great pricing for their sangria ( passion fruit ! )
i highly recommend the malbec by the glass .
service is awful , i was checking the menu - was my first time there - and a short lady asked me what i wanted , when i replied i was still checking she replied with a sarcastic comment 'take your time my friend , we are open until 1am ' .
but anyway , the wonderful manager scott lancaster ending up comping our entire bill and we were not expecting that at all .
i think the masala on top was the chickpea one and it was a good compliment .
do n't use the bathroom and do n't expect a clean interior .
so much potential , yet the result is awkward and kinda drab .
great place to buy a drink and an appetizer .
there 's loud music , so i can understand .
she also considers their cosmos to be very good and potent .
i had a tall beer on draft , and some nachos which were actually pretty good .
i love the full bar and the specialty cocktails too .
i really like hockey sushi , the prices are very cheap and the food is excellent .
it was a nice size but $ 15.00 .
i do n't know if he knew how audible he was but it set for an uncomfortable setting knowing that perhaps your phone conversations etc are not very private knowing how thin the walls are ... .other than that the hotel does have a personable setting not being on the strip .
i enjoyed every piece of it fresh flavorful . the fries , rice , and beans are all good too .
this was very disappointing .
the decor was very nice , but cluttered with flags and other strange things .
unfortunately , despite having a patio , metro does not allow dogs .
the sides ( fries ) were great the thick piece of half raw tuna on a bun was weird .
food is okay . prices are reasonable .
then the decor and color is so plain and unwelcoming . not particularly clean and bright .
however , everything i 've eaten has been great except fish & chips ( grease & chips ) and i 've had about everything on menu , breakfast lunch & dinner .
they offer a lot and the staff is courteous and friendly .
not only was the service slow the entire night but when they chose to be attentive they did it the wrong way .
beers were not even close to full and wine poor was average .
i believe after a certain time it becomes more like a lounge with a live dj .
i 'm a sucker for anything with bubbles , and the orange pomegranate champagne cocktail definitely delivered .
i can eat in silence but the combination of the poor lighting is straight up awkward .
we 're not loaded by any means , but $ 50 seems like a fair deal to me for high end fare .
although i do n't drink beer , i was impressed by their incredible selection of beer on tap .
prices were very reasonable .
it was so chocolatey and rich , could have paired well with a tall glass of milk .
the draft beer was totally flat . pretty awful .
love their sake and beer as well .
we also had 3 different glasses of their pinot noir .
i waited in line for over 5 minutes with only 3 people in front of me .
also the bathroom had torn wallpaper off the wall and the counters were not as clean .
dinner arrived , but tasted nasty .
we ordered fancy wine , cocktails and huge appetizers .
i had the pulled pork sandwich and tamarind fruit juice . it was very satisfying and filling .
great food and drinks . love their sunday brunch and drink specials .
chicken was cold.. so that was a lie .
but hey , that 's part of its charm , right ?
i also ordered a gyro sandwich with fries also huge portion and very hot fresh fries !
food had awesome flavors and presentation .
my husband and i got pizza here about 2 weeks ago . the pizza was just ok. there did n't seem to be enough sauce so it had a dry taste .
the much anticipated chicken parm was a little on the dry side but nothing a little more sauce could 've helped with . it was just the right amount of food .
great italian dishes with homemade pasta and wonderful sauces .
it was ok. chicken was foot .
there was not a great selection some of the food was cold , the bread was like bricks , the `` fresh pasta ' was terrible .
not only is their wine list satisfactory , the cocktails and beyond awesome too .
however , neither tasted good on their own ; so the combination of the two could n't possibly be good either . multiply that example across the rest of the food there too .
this place is really very cute . i absolutely love the quaint , cozy feel .
prices were cheaper than ca prices which was nice as well .
first off , the decor is awesome .
also the bathroom stinks and is kinda dirty .
they have pretty cheap lunch specials ( $ 7- $ 8 ) that are good in quantity and pretty tasty .
the good beer was n't on special at all , and their `` domestic '' beers were all pretty much the crap i wo n't drink .
wine was great too .
she looked at me like i was being rude asking her to run my credit card .
the whole thing just feels ... dirty .
lunch specials were generous portions and a decent price too .
look , i get it , service is fast here ... but let me get in the door before you start asking me what i want to order . it 's annoying to be asked `` what can i get for you '' before my body is even fully in the building .
the imperial beef was extremely disappointing , sounded great on the menu , but again the beef was chewy , tasteless once the sauce was all gone and then you can feel and taste the boiled meat .
the lunch buffet is amazing ( especially considering it 's less than $ 11 per person ) .
great place to get refreshed in vegas .
server was slow but you 're at the airport food was decent ! but something happened after wth the server that was not very pleasant ... soooooo they only get 3 stars lol
the one thing i noticed is that the decor is either intentionally older or very outdated .
crowded and loud but great for adventuresome eating .
they were incredible ! the sweet potato fries were on point as well .
i do n't drink beer but the waitress said they had a good selection .
loud ass hell , laughing off the top of their lungs , and just hanging out in large numbers blocking walkways .
almost forgot about my terrible coronarita ... cheap margarita mix in a normal drinking glass with a corona sticking out .
i love mama lola 's . probably order from them once a week it seems .
also , the bartenders are awesome - joined me in some whiskey shots to ring my birthday in !
that immediately gives the feel of a gallery ( duh ) however the dominance of abstract paintings on that white background becomes overwhelming at a certain point to the point where your mind is begging for anything else .
the whole meal was delicious .
my coffee was terrible i did n't drink any of it .
choice of beers was n't to bad .
prices for the drinks are n't too bad , mostly ranging from $ 2- $ 4 , however the dessert was a little pricey , $ 7 for a square inch piece of chocolate cake .
friendly service , nice decor , very relaxing .
the food was delicious .
pretty decor , but we found the lighting odd .
they have a full bar with decent selection of beers on tap , by the bottle and wine .
i did n't see one decent beer on tap or in the coolers .
always came to our table to make sure we were okay or needed anything else .
the bad and the ugly : all-you-can-drink wristband with several craft beers ( mostly ipa 's ) on draft as well as wine and well drinks .
2. the menu , way too cluttered , font too small , very hard to read compounded by the poor lighting .
a sandwich costs around 7 dollars which is n't too bad compared to most other places .
it was a little creepy .
it was n't even bottled , pretty sure it was tap .
we got the stone crab appetizer which was incredibly delicious and probably the best deal on the menu .
you 'd like a margarita ? you 'd like a happy hour margarita ?
stayed in the terrace one bedroom . fantastic view facing the strip .
the corn dip was good but not great , or lacked some depth of flavor and the pita-like chips were neither soft nor crispy , which did n't bother me but i can imagine some might dislike .
my total was like $ 12 .
it 's small , rustic , in a quiet corner of town , and we loved it !
some of the machines are 25 cents ( much older ones with the old sounds -- very nostalgic if you ever played them then , i did n't ) , most are 50 cents per play , some of the newer ones are 75 cents .
the only negative aspect was the loud atmosphere due to a lack of music : i could hear the entire conversations from the table behind me and the one beside me .
impressive impressive ... this is rock solid italian comfort food for sure .
having said that , the service was lacking . although our waitress was nice , she was for the most part nowhere to be found .
i love lolo 's ... i live in ca and i want them to open a restaurant in los angeles .
lots of food for a good price
maybe it 's the whimsical decorations that filled the interior .
the price for admission is not too bad .
our waitress ( who was the only server ) looked like she was bothered by the fact we came into this restaurant . she was not very friendly .
the food was good and reasonably priced .
this place has a nice atmosphere and is quiet but tables are so close to each other you could hear other table 's conversation .
i got a moscow mule , which was served in a classic copper mug ( as it should be ) , and it was delicious . i was pleasantly surprised with the balance of sweet , spicy , and sour as i 've had some bad moscow mules in my time .
awesome food , service was fantastic . waiter was great and recommended a great bottle of wine .
it does n't need much , just a new paint job , lighting update and some carefully placed decor and it would look 100x better .
finally someone brought our apps out , which were good , but no waiter . after a total of 45 minutes i asked the manager to just get us our check .
the price is also very reasonable .
so good ! beware , the mojitos are really strong .
i was visiting my parents here in vegas when they suggested a place for great fried oysters .
prices were pretty reasonable as well .
it may sound stupid , but in a world of everyone rushing , it was nice to receive some patience .
yes , you 're eating in a strip mall , so it is n't very fancy and you 'll look pretty cruddy under the fluorescent lights ... but who cares ?
the food was bland and needed seasoning .
sadly it did n't have any flavor and was very bland . really over cooked .
they were n't even smart enough to have the two differently priced menus separated .
the house margarita was n't bad either .
the worst part is the dish cost $ 34 , insanely expensive for a small steak and a small portion of potatoes .
they have a pretty good beer list , though nothing on draft .
the food was great , prices very reasonable .
the waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were .
good food , fair prices .
they did have a pretty extensive list for beer and cocktail options so it 's not all about crappy beer .
in defense of the poor young waiter that was attempting to do his best , they were understaffed and we were told that there was only one sushi chef ( the owner ) in the kitchen .
our server then told her to `` be nice then '' . we decided to leave .
the sauce is very bland .
i assure you i 'm neither demanding nor rude .
ticket prices vary but are n't as outrageous as other venues with sky rocketed fees .
we received one of two tables that did not have umbrellas , but , being that it was n't melt you down hot , it was fine .
the beer glasses are n't cold .
i wish they still had the byob option ( corking fee applies ) because i had tasteful bottles of wine i would have loved to pair my meal with .
we were seated promptly and everybody was very attentive .
typical moxie 's night club atmosphere with dim lighting , coupled with waitresses in revealing outfits which some people might appreciate but i just find it uncomfortable .
what bar does n't have coors light ? did not have it in bottle or draft .
the food was a little more expensive than i expected , i paid $ 65 canadian for 3 courses , which is not bad at all , but slightly more expensive than some equivalents in montreal .
i felt that the place was a shithole disguised with nice decor .
but you 'll have a good time
it 's pretty cool ( i know , weird to write a review about restrooms ) because it looks like a spaceship inside .
the scenery is amazing . you get a great view of red rock .
i rarely go to dairy queen but i was feeling nostalgic so we decided to have lunch there and i 'm glad we did .
this place has horrible customer service .
the staff is friendly and courteous .
it 's a cute little place with a nice patio to sit out on during the summer .
nothing in the sandwich only rice and few pickles and a little bit of dry meat .
staff is very slow , it took more than 25 mins to make 4 simple cold sandwiches and there were n't too many people in the shop . currently 6 people in line and are not being helped , definitely understaffed .
the best part of the evening was the bananas foster ( terrific ) and a great price for a bottle of wine .
the menu is pretty comprehensive and the prices are fair .
walking in , i felt a little intimidated by the overwhelming presence of stuff on the walls and trophies everywhere .
pasta is made fresh in house and flavors are balanced and delicious .
we ordered a half bottle of chardonnay only because we did n't want to drink too much since we had gotten a free bottle of alcohol with our room reservations .
not having beer descriptions in a beer bar is just wrong .
the prices are a little high but not crazy considering the restaurant 's location .
everything on the menu is a decent price .
the wait here is ridiculous .
the food is presented nicely and it is delicious .
the absolute worst chicken wings i 've ever had in my life ! old crusty overdone and dry + disgusting flavouring .
there 's a check-in for a free glass of wine .
our waitress was friendly , cheerful & attentive .
awesome view of the kitchen at the bar area .
the atmosphere is nice but really loud .
the staff are courteous , efficient and attentive .
prime rib chewy and while admittedly we were a larger than average party to serve , a cold piece of prime does n't cut it .
whatever ... i mean , there was nothing bad or wrong with the pizza , but it was kind of bland .
she recommended a great bottle of wine .
i know the reviews say price is $ - that is wrong . the price is $ $ - and that is my only reason for not giving them 5 stars .
drinks were a little weak but draft beers worked well enough .
saturday night and only 2 waiters 1 1/2 busser and a hostess helping to wait and buss is absurd when there are 6 empty tables i can see ( presumably more ) , and a half hour wait .
you can get a great meal for about $ 10- $ 15 ?
do n't get to know them too well , you will be sorry . in las vegas people can snatch and grab shit , no questions asked , but if you have a dispute of the most minor you will pay .
i was very happy we tried tessaro 's . we were seated right away , the kids and i had great food and the service was fast .
and the prices are very reasonable about 1/2 of what a sushi bar charges , and frankly better quality than some .
the prices were more than fair .
the pour was horrible and the beer was flat .
unfortunately , the chicken meat seemed cheap and i ended up not eating parts due to the unpleasant texture . also , the katsu sauce was not what i was expecting ( not bad - just different ) .
we asked what was in the margaritas as in what kind of tequila and the bartender responded `` everything is tequila based like every margarita '' .
i inquired and the guy rudely replied that if i had 2 salads or not .
i have been here many times , have not been disappointed yet .
the atmosphere is pretty cool and it 's a hip place to be .
the bathroom was disgusting and out of paper towels . the floors were dirty and it looked like the toilet had been leaking making the floor wet .
bland , vanilla food void of ingredients .
over all not impressed at all
it was a lot of fun to drink , and got us pretty tipsy .
awesome with spinach pumpkin seeds with a touch of the most tasty tomato sauce .
the lunch menu is very very well priced , even if the extras are expensive .
very fresh . reasonable prices .
people were stabbed at the hotel walkway during our stay and the view is not all that great because no one gets a view of the strip .
it 's a nice place to sit , eat and talk to your friends .
the decor is so bad it 's bad ; a nightmare of plastic plants covering every available surface lit by dim but still remarkably gaudy neon .
we also tried their prawns , and wow , this place has the best fried prawns i 've ever had in the valley !
really enjoyed the quinoa stuffed avocado and all of the sauces . definitely recommend !
the salad bar was good- i loved that they have a huge bowl of crispy bacon : ) i eat my meat well done .
it 's a shame of such great restaurant 's quality have dropped , especially when you 're paying over $ 600+ for a meal .
i will say , $ 32.00 for a double shot of a medium quality blended scotch ( that 's the cost of a full bottle ) was pretty ridiculous .
our waitress appeared to be the only one running around working . took about 20 minutes to get our check .
thought the name meant beer or good drinks . beers were pricey .
great lunch at good price .
we did n't drink , but it looked like they had 32 different beers on tap .
my trash can had a woman 's makeup debris ; i found a hair on the edge of the bed . the room itself just looks `` rough '' , chipped furniture , dirty cracks , oh and the patched wall in the entry !
terrible experience . worst customer service i have ever experienced .
i was n't expecting to spend nearly $ 20 on lunch , but the price is my only negative .
stopped by this morning and waited over 20 mins for my order , then it was wrong .
always will be a family favorite because of the atmosphere and memories ! totally cute place to go with the family and really good desserts !
no margaritas . just beer and wine : -/ what 's a girl to do .
we 're so lucky we did !
the special sandwich did n't taste good either .
and at the end they charged us an 18 % gratuity , but we were only party of 5 and that 's for parties of 6+ .
the bar itself is nice but not worth the money bathrooms ... atrocious ... they stink ( pee and mildew ) , walls are falling apart , out of order ( photos attached ) ...
nice atmosphere , relaxing , great time having a drink .
pretty cheap meals for a pretty large quantity !
not bad for the price around $ 66 tax in .
good value for the price
one of our favorite restaurants in the whole area .
i am pretty boring and order the old school roll because i like it simple .
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
the beer is cheap but the beer is also awful ; my boyfriend drinks a lot of beer and we went on national beer day .
a bit tough because the crab was n't broken open as much but nevertheless good .
unfortunately i did not like it and ordered a bottled domestic .
the chicken was moist and perfectly grilled and the house dressing just finished the product perfectly .
i did n't eat any of it , honestly i was worried the meat was bad .
no draft beers which was a bummer , but still a decent selection of bottled beers .
i had a blackberry cocktail it was strong and good .
good bbq , the corn cakes are off the charts , and cheap pbr is always on the menu !
this place is great for work or to have a casual business meeting . great staff and great atmosphere .
highly recommend coming for dinner .
good bar to drink at ... but maybe not eat at
i do n't even care about the bright lighting or off decor ( or there lack of ) .
the best part is that their beers are very cheap .
from the drink menu , i recommend the coconut cloud , the mojito , or the crazy cuban .
the entire bathroom was filthy : no soap , no paper towels and the locks on the stalls are missing .
the prices are not pretty fucking good .
the pizza sits on warmers waiting to be thrown in an oven and re-heated . end result is a bland , watery attempt at new york thin crust for $ 7.00 .
staff is very attentive and well trained .
they are pretty large in size and there are great flavors to choose from .
the draft and bottle beer selection is legit , but mostly focused on regional selections which was disappointing .
they have a nice selection and decent prices for what they serve .
ok , but not great . food was good , but at $ 40 per person , why is there no free bread if you get a steak ?
i believe the special pricing continued until 7:00pm .
horrible pho , meat was chewy and they barely gave me any meat in the soup . after giving the soup a try i thought maybe there coconut macaroons they supposedly make from scratch would make me change my mind about this restaurant lol they were dreadful as well .
price wise it 's probably like between one and two dollar signs . figure $ 12 each if you get a drink .
super tacky in my opinion .
love all the choices here , and the ahi is super mild and tastes fresh !
the food was very reasonably priced .
you can take a city girl here and she will instantly feel like a cowgirl .
the place is pretty small , and not much room to sit and eat .
super expensive . this is more about quantity than quality .
the food is great and reasonably priced .
i got a refund but was so close to blowing up on them for their negligence since they saw me impatiently waiting around the counter with out checking on me .
only thing is that it 's pretty pricey ... $ 20 per person .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
we love the happy hour they have and the drinks always come out perfect .
i love the model where you basically pay $ 35.00 for three courses , $ 45 for 4 and $ 55 for 5 so creative .
service was good too . we got our food reasonably quick , and our waiter was very courteous and attentive .
the pork bbq is my absolute favorite and the spring rolls are delicious .
the only drawback would be the price .
ok , i love this place . their happy hour is a great deal and it goes till 7. everyone who works there is super friendly .
i also went for drinks here and am obsessed with their red sangria , so good .
ladies , do n't skip the white wine sangria for a refreshing , light drink .
the price was reasonable .
prices are crazy cheap too .
the presentation was awful .
the interior of the restaurant is bland , needs some decor to brighten it up .
great vibe , nice and relaxed . the staff is really good , very friendly and mellow .
i only had beer .
my favorite is the shrimp with onion rings but all food is really good .
the cocktails and non alcohol bevs are perfect to go with the food .
i 'm not an expert on interior design or anything like that , but it just did n't feel comfortable in there .
place if spacious and clean , staff is friendly . i will definitely come back for another shawarma : )
the cauliflower appetizer was delicious and the chicken tika masala and eggplant dishes were excellent with many levels of flavors .
i do n't feel totally comfortable tipping before services are rendered .
the cool thing was , it came with a glass of wine on top of the 3 course meal .
overall a trendy and comfortable place that may be better suited for cocktails and appetizers before the show .
i love that they do n't skimp on quality with their inexpensive prices .
he got the lasagna which was absolutely heavenly , and my spaghetti was delicious as well !
they have a good draught beer selection and wine selection as well as a full bar but i was not drinking tonight so i could only notice the selections .
inside , there were tables and some casual seating areas .
they always make sure we are happy and our water glasses are full ! great service and food !
we have been coming to the veggie house for a while now and we love it .
oh , and the cocktails and beer are amazing too .
if you get a cocktail try the bramble it was delicious and recommended to me by the waitress .
we only do wine and beer at the bar . ''
this place was nice and clean with lots of seating areas . there is also parking as it is located on a plaza .
not too expensive either .
the only downfall is it 's cash only but that 's a small price to pay .
for that , i should have a server and not have to get my own utensils .
shiraz wine was great , no issues with that .
awesome neighborhood place . beautiful patio , cozy atmosphere , and , most importantly , great food .
it is located close to parking garage , which was really nice .
i usually love the restaurant although this morning i was disappointed .
the calamari was delicious and the breeding was nice and crispy .
the `` hippie '' ( blond haired guy with glasses ) that handled by order did not even offer an apology for the dismal ( and that is being kind ) service .
the drinks were creative and an extensive wine list .
unless you count dust on the tables as decor . only upsides ?
not only was this place gross and dirty and had horrible service , they did not seem to even care .
so if the server is having a good shift and sells $ 1,000 ; they have pay the business $ 60 !
i did n't see the bill , but my understanding is it was reasonable even for a party of 25 people which included lots of children .
the food is always excellent and the portions are enormous .
a nice meal is about $ 18 and a good sandwich is like $ 12 or so .
this i totally respect .
and they also provide a free glass champagne . excellent service as well .
disappointing draft list . with a name like pints on penn i expected a great beer choice ... of the 5 or 6 selections offered only 2 were available , bottle selection was lacking , not even local brewery selections .
a perfect ratio of chips to toppings .
what i thought was cool about it is there is a ton of rooms , if you came with a small group you could almost have your own private dining section .
creepy bathroom all the way up the tiny staircase .
the the dim lighting , grubby decor , and bland menu offer little reason to be nostalgic .
would come often , but expensive though : ( $ 15 lb .
i got some takeout chicken seekh kebabs , and i found they were overly spiced but they were definitely a good portion .
the only complaint was the hallway decor made it seem like the walls were moving ... kind of trippy but that may have just been me . haha .
for $ 20 dollars , i could get a decent family style meal with some friends .
2. i did recommend to the super nice woman taking my order that they might want to put up a couple signs directing people who want takeout to the takeout line and people who wanted to dine-in to either seat themselves or wait to be seated , as the case might be .
beer and margaritas available , not sure about any other alcohol .
i am not a huge fan of cocktails so i ordered a margarita .
very cool little spot with lots of sammy hagar memorabilia . nice clean dining room with friendly waitstaff .
the 2 waters bottles in the room cost $ 4 each and 3.50 for each cup of coffee and the manager was worthless .
their mini desserts were also delightful .
the wines were great as well .
nice wine by the glass !
prices are good too .
the service is quick and our server was very friendly .
they have a great outdoor eating patio , which is private and secluded .
i love the fact that the appetizers come with a little side of fries , so each person can have their own appetizer !
my only complaint was that their `` mystery beer '' , which appears in the draft beer pages , was a bottle of an octoberfest beer .
i opted for the creamy one and it was delicious .
i opted for the soup instead , a tomato bisque , and it was pretty disappointing .
the waitress comes over and says she forgot to put in our order , places an ice cold loaf of bread on our table and apologizes .
i love the squash blossom quesadillas and the fresh , bubbly , homemade tortilla chips .
excellent muffins . their muffins are large , dense and tasty .
the bacon had a little bit of a sweet hint of maybe brown sugar or something all i know is it was incredibly good .
delicious warmed up bagels of every kind for a decent price .
never in my 9 yrs of stay have i been yelled yet by a restaurant receptionist ( they have been rude , yes and indifferent , yes , but never ever yelled at ) .
the drinks are wonderful and if you are looking for a non-alcoholic drink , you must try their arnold palmer , it 's the best i 've ever had .
it tasted good , was n't anything super memorable .
i 'm tempted to tell you all that sambalatte is terrible so that you 'll leave it all to me , but that would be almost criminal .
a couple of glasses of wine and some beet salad and we were full .
beverage wise , margarita selection is great and a great red sangria .
not only did orders take a ridiculous long time to prepare , but my order was essentially pushed below two large groups of people .
the restaurant is on the smaller side and it 's a bit loud due to the number of people in the small space .
the lights were dimmed so not bright enough to read the menu with using your cell phone flash .
this is 6 $ and can feed 2 to 3 people for sure .
drinks are decent but overpriced . $ 14 for a margarita ?
it 's very authentic and decently priced .
i also felt pretty queasy after eating the shrimp .
they even added salt and pepper with out realizing they had the wrong meat .
fantastic food and menu . prices are super low .
unfortunately , the bacon on my sandwich was hard to chew and the egg was a little overdone .
also , they have a ton a healthy , interesting salads that i just loved .
maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we wo n't care that the food is bland .
excellent food ! the spinach dip is simply the best appetizer you can get anywhere and everything on the menu is delicious .
they have a lot of options but i did n't think either my fiancé or my burger tasted great .
the combo even comes with a choice of a side , which was tremendous value in my opinion .
i 'm just not a fan of shared bench seating with your neighbors right on top of you .
the music is a bit loud all over the restaurant , but they were good songs playing so i was okay with it .
they also have some of the best chicken and tuna salad i have had anywhere in the country .
this weekend , i entered the dark and mysterious restaurant hidden on 40th and camelback .
careful ! they tack on an extra $ 17 per night for a bogus `` service fee '' .
inexpensive and pretty good .
i am so lucky they are not on my side of town or i would be here every day .
when you pay an arm and a leg for food you expect a high level of food and service .
crowded but the wait was n't unbearable and the live musicians created a nice ambiance .
slightly more expensive than i would expect .
the worst part of this all was the food came out lukewarm and dry .
price was more than fair for the menu .
reasonably priced and good food .
excellent service and very wonderful staff .
nice pool and grounds can not make up for very bad service , rooms dated .
usually it 's cheaper per ounce as you go larger , right ? weird pricing .
the wine list runs on to great length , we settled for a couple of glasses of a malbec , leaving investigation of the list to another time .
order a miller lite and was given a draft beer even though i said i hated draft .
jameson at my bar is 9 $ and even that is pretty high but 11 $ for jameson in plaza midwood is absolutely ridiculous .
i can eat in silence but the combination of the poor lighting is straight up awkward .
prices are really good as well .
decent food that is priced well .
only negative thing i 'll say is the bathroom area was dirty ! the hallway to the bathroom was pretty gross .
very slow we waited about a half hour to get food and when we got it they made it wrong and inedible .
buffalo wing sauce had good flavor , but was a little thin . fries were n't bad , but a little soggy .
she should go work fast food because service industry is not for her
fresh rolls were ok. vermicelli meat was very bland and the usual sauce did n't add much taste - most disappointing dish i 've had in a while .
i love this place .
only negative , not many beers on tap , we ordered three times before we got a beer listed that they actually had on tap : (
its casual setting and quirky decor make it a comfortable place for catching up , although you may find yourself backing into the person behind you if you 're seated along the wall .
the waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were .
i made a mistake , the food was tasteless ! they get two stars for the service , but it seemed to be almost too fast ... as if it was already prepared somewhere and had been waiting an hour for me to show up ... never again !
pizza was pretty good , the deal on mondays is great , $ 10.99 for an 18 inch ( up charges if you do a half/half specialty pizza ) .
a 5 star rating experience except for when they 're slammed and even then it 's incredible .
service is decent , not amazing . and drinks are a bit over priced .
fair prices and great food .
waiter continued to be rude and inpatient the entire time he dealt with us .
it 's affordable ( under $ 10 ) , fast and always tasty .
the food is pretty good for the price .
based on the price $ 36 the portions size for the fish was ridiculous , there was only one filet .
beer menu is severely limited with only one or two decent beers not made by budweiser .
i started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila .
the outdoor area looks really cool . they have comfortable seating and a fire pit !
4. restaurant row has so many great places to eat .
and the prices here are at such a good value .
and the price is cheap especially for all the food you get .
tasty food for a reasonable price .
it was a place to go to have a great time with friends .
this would be a great spot for a date !
i 've only been here during happy hour for the $ 5 burgers , $ 4 shakes and $ 3 sides .
looked dark outside and parked on street a block or so away , but realized they have their own parking lot and it was fairly bright inside .
the only good thing was that the buffet was clean and the extra $ 13 dollars per person for unlimited wine or mimosas and our server was great !
definitely give this place a try you will not be disappointed . returned yet again , every chance i get i take the opportunity to enjoy some great food .
the food is not fancy and its a bar atmosphere ( no kids ) . the prices are very reasonable .
portions and quality are good . prices ( including sake ) are reasonable .
i enjoyed my dinner with the cucumber cooler , which is a mojito with a cucumber twist . delicious and refreshing !
like many others said , the wait was not the greatest .
i thought the tap list was great even though i did n't have a beer .
our server , sebastian , was very attentive and so were the assistants .
it was well-seasoned , perfectly cooked , and the hush puppies reminded me of corn bread , which i love .
we went with wine over beer because they do not have beer on draft - there 's a large bottled beer selection but it would be nice if there were beers on draft .
we enjoyed talking to the wait staff and our complex food requests were welcomed !
higher levels get a better deal , as cheap as $ 18 for dinner .
the only thing is its rather pricey , so be prepared for a hefty tab . it is summerlin after all .
still , this place is very enjoyable and reasonably priced .
delicious food . reasonable pricing .
25 $ for all you can eat dinner , not bad .
the pool was great .
( not so good ) kinda creepy .
soup a bit rich but very tasty .
love this place . was there for a girls weekend and we wanted go hungover food .
food is amazing , and the service was so helpful . i had a salad , a pizza and a dessert , with 2 cocktails and everything i tasted was delicious .
we had the sev puri , all the ingredients tasted very fresh with just the right amount of spice . i also had the chicken tikka masala and it was also very good , they made it spicy to my specific request , even the nan was great .
the casino is large and has everything you would need without leaving the building ( movies , bowling , etc ) the buffet i ate was very good . the pool area was nice and large , large enough so you felt comfortable and relaxed .
great food , friendly wait staff .
a bit $ $ but good for a now and then dinner out .
stuffed peppers = delicious ! of course the sandwiches are good too ( just read the other reviews ) .
the service was horrible .
not too over the top and very reasonably priced .
good food and drinks .
only $ 10 bucks ! - not bad , right ?
service is super quick and prices are cheap .
i love this place !
i 'm willing to bet our margaritas had no tequila in them .
i love love love eating here !
we have been coming to this restaurant for years and it has always been a great experience .
the chicken thighs were okay and the waffle a bit soggy .
pairs really nicely with a cocktail drink .
the portions are huge and the wine list is priced competitively .
if you are spending $ 300 for dinner for two you expect decent service .
the portions for the entrees are pretty small as well .
bit small for bands - the live music was too loud so we had to rush our meal to get out , even though i love live bands .
... oh , and the starter soup is simply awesome !
the staff at this place are all super nice and make sure that you have what you need .
the whole bill with 4 beers was only $ 52 !
i had the cajun tortellini , it was decent and the portion was pretty solid but it did not meet $ 20 expectations , i would say the same of the lobster mac and cheese though this is the dish i would repeat if pressed . calamari was also okay , not bad , not great .
they have a full bar but i was more impressed with the 20 or so craft beers on tap .
this version was amazing . i also tried a chicken and shiitake bun .
there was n't much of a tap selection . also i do n't know if we picked 6 bad beers or if the taps were bad but none of the beers were good .
this is n't a $ 400.00 strip ultra high end joint .
the scene was chill and it was n't as loud as it was upstairs .
their lunch specials are a good deal considering the price point ( $ 9-10 ) .
great food , great ambiance and love the look of this place ! mr brews has upgraded their interior and it looks amazing .
it is not too fancy , hence the prices are not too high , which makes it an affordable place to eat .
publicus has set the bar and set it high .
i 've been wanting to check this place out for awhile now , and tonight i finally had the opportunity to stop in for some take out .
this cost $ 29 which was also a sad part .
in fact , i think the most expensive entree on the menu is around $ 9 .
only thing i wished was that they went lighter on the salad dressing . overpowered the dish .
this place just screams adorable .
recommendation for wine was amazing .
while it was n't dry , it definitely had sort of a chewy texture .
the interior does not get proper design and some furniture get placed in some awkward places .
the ground pepperoni and sausage are unique . awesome !
pretty good pizza ! great crust , loads of cheese , and great thick cut pepperoni .
all the flavor notes hit perfect , and the spicy diablo potatoes were spot on .
we did n't even eat because the service was so bad . we were asked if we wanted inside or out , we said it did n't matter .
i recommend asking the server for a good suggestion on wine pairing .
we wanted something with `` chips and salsa '' and a decent beer selection .
service was not to par , bordering to poor .
things like the establishment being too loud or having `` outdated decor '' wo n't ruin my meal .
i then switched to beer - they have a pretty good beer list available , too .
if you 're looking for a place to go that has a terrace and sun , this is a great place to check out .
that is to say , a typical vegas price for rather mediocre food .
when you want to spend under $ 5 on a ( decent ) meal , go here .
but it is a high energy type of music which gives this place a special vibe .
the only real flaw it they should put padding on the ceiling or wall to suck up the loud noise from the plastered customers ..
the wine selection is pretty extensive .
highly recommend to visit this place , especially good for a special occasion .
they make sure we feel welcomed and are food is always hot and fresh .
bad idea ! margaritas were ok but not booze in them !
poor planning on the hostess part .
4. this may sound weird , but there are heavy plastic coverings on the tables that make the dishes stick to the table .
oh , i almost forgot , they have very creative ceiling details and strange paintings of dogs everywhere too .
and sometimes the lighting makes me feel like i 'm being interrogated ( it 's a little dark and creepy ) .
i opened up my side salad and was n't at all impressed as it looked like something i would 've put together , boring .
we feel obliged to warn people about this terrible place . do yourselves a favor , and go elsewhere .
right off the bat the staff was super helpful .
considering i went here twice within 3 weeks i would say that i really enjoy this place , especially this location since it 's near my house .
we were also surprised to be given fried rice ; seemed like an afterthought but it was not even good .
they are very expensive in comparison to your average burger joint . i paid $ 24 for the burger , onion rings and fountain drink which is way more than what you should pay for a burger that 's decent .
first time here and we received terrible customer service . i usually do n't write many reviews but as a marketing major i was in shock .
i love the vintage and 80 's feeling it has .
the food was good and prices are reasonable .
the food was delicious .
i ordered the pb & chocolate and was shocked at how watered down it was . i was unable to finish it .
the only reason i am rating 4 stars and not 5 is because the price is high compared to the portions - $ 70 on lunch for two is steep even for summerlin .
both were great ! sampled four of the house beers and a cocktail , all were delicious and well-crafted .
been to kfc all over the world . germany , dubai , etc ... this chicken was bland and completely void of the signature flavor and texture you expect from kfc .
while during my stay i saw many attendants in this area , but not one time did i not smell musty old urine soaked floors , dirty tile walls and disgusting stall walls ... .gross !
this is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat .
i ordered blackened chicken parmigiana which took forever to come , and it came with a rubbery texture absent of any desired flavor .
the waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were .
the patio setting on a nice night is not pretty .
not too fancy , not too cheap looking .
we did order some margaritas and again they were n't bad just your typical margarita .
i would of asked for a refill as she walked by except for the fact she disappeared the entire time .
food was amazing and served in generous portions .
our room was dirty , mostly the bathroom . the counter was dirty , there was hair in the tub and pee on the toilet !
and of course , the name long wong 's is a funny name that conjures up a lot of snickering and off color jokes .
the walls are brightly colored , which i enjoyed a lot , but along one side was a series of illustrations depicting ... a person ?
drink wise i love their ice blended drinks .
the sangria is sweet and thankfully sold by the pitcher .
they do n't carry hard liquor , beer and wine only , so no cocktails .
we ordered the mojito and it was good too .
full bar and a great wine list organized by price .
yes its kind of scary ; but omg .
just spent $ 55 and got charged $ 1 for a cup of water ! thanks for running such a classy place that i paid $ 10 for a frozen hot chocolate but ca n't get a cup of water .
both are good quality and about $ 50-60 for a meal .
great noodles ! the spicy peanut is delicious !
we just enjoyed another fabulous meal with a nice super tuscan bottle of wine .
the wine list was also very good and impressive .
only tried the calamari in that dish but it was easy to chew and the batter was light .
this place is horrible .
they have huge beers for 4 dollars which isnt bad at all .
during happy hour with 1/2 off drinks , it 's a pretty awesome deal .
highly recommend to anyone ! the guys working were super friendly and funny !
only downside is the wait of 25 minutes for take out .
i mean sure , there are one or two things that are good but not good as to pay $ 28 dollars .
service is good but not great . prices are really affordable .
service was top notch and the food was really good . we got the calamari appetizer , which was delectable .
also the fried green tomato and deviled egg was awesome .
also , my rendang dish tasted so mediocre that it tasted nothing special .
price is more than fair and the environment is very friendly .
in their defense , the bottled beer was good .
the restroom was pretty nasty , urine on the toilet seat , on the floor , trash filled up , trash on the floor , and only one restroom for one customer .
a good steak does not need oil and butter to taste good . a little salt and pepper is all it should take .
delicious , fresh , no complaints at all .
dining companions tried the gyoza ( dumplings ) and enjoyed them .
it was $ 9.75 plus tax for a very mediocre meal from a storefront restaurant .
prices for food are good .
they have a full bar but i was more impressed with the 20 or so craft beers on tap .
our meals came with a salad option and we got the kale salad and the potato salad . both were so good !
they only had a few beers on tap , and none that were particularly exciting .
david at the bar is awesome ! very professional , attentive , and knowledgeable .
grape street has a cool atmosphere at night .
it was too loud as far as ambiance goes , but it was n't too invasive .
the drink selection was so lame .
enjoyed the diamond perks of one free alcohol drink and served drinks .
the staff is friendly and the environment is easy , clean and welcoming .
the food quality was good and reasonably priced .
anyway , this was not the first time i 've had this beef but it was nothing to write home about and the fries were quite mediocre .
we did n't have to flag down a server - we were addressed pretty quickly .
not even someone saying i will be right with you just to acknowledge a table .
ca n't say much for the decor- tables and chairs are rickety and the decor bland .
only gripes are the little details in the room were overlooked ... loose faucet handles , disgusting bath mat , moldy looking grout between bath tiles ... these really kept me from giving it 4 or 5 stars .
the el diablo cocktail with ginger beer was refreshing . the blood sangria was sweet and has a strong cherry flavor .
finally , the interior lighting is a bit odd .
we ordered the pork neck congee with preserved egg , the beef and the shrimp rice noodle roll , and the pan fried dumplings . everything was delicious !
i love this place but hate hate hate the crappie scribbled on walls for decor ... .
the only knock is that there was no beer on tap ; bottle selection was good though .
very bland food , basically a take out place . they have beers listed on the menu board but they were out of drafts , out of modelo , and the corona was n't cold !
the soup came out cold . the meat was also cold ( as if it had been partly thawed ) .
it was so bad , we finally got up and tried to speak to the manager .
good service and reasonable prices .
the decor looks like someones grandmothers home - who was blind - and had bad taste in wallpaper .
all were very good , and reasonably priced .
they bring in a nice sized skating ring with lots of fire pits , and have a free train ride that goes thru out the property on a tour if their amazingly decorated grounds .
we only do wine and beer at the bar . ''
the decor is modern and classy .
it was pretty damn good and very fairly priced .
i chose to drink a glass of the super tuscan wine .
the only real flaw it they should put padding on the ceiling or wall to suck up the loud noise from the plastered customers ..
not cheap , but reasonably priced for what you get .
avg price is about $ 12 and the most expensive item , the chix and rib combo is $ 21 . for kids under 10 there is a duds menu .
i got the muscles and they were n't bad but the fries were too soggy .
the lobby looks good but get any further and you start to see the nasty ceiling tiles , cracked and stained drywall , broken faucets , moldy grout and broken furniture .
the staff are attentive and the prices are more than reasonable for the quality .
everything from the food to the atmosphere to the owner to the cleanliness of the restaurant was a great experience ! staff was very knowledgeable about the menu .
that would be the beer selection . the wine selection looked pretty good as well , but we did not see anything other than beer at every table .
nailed it ! i 'm excited !
awesome service and drinks - definitely give them a try !
they have a full bar but i was more impressed with the 20 or so craft beers on tap .
bang for your buck is pretty damn good , well seasoned , generous portions for the $ 6 price tag .
i was disappointed that they have no draft beers .
we ordered beers and were served some beer cocktail they were n't bad but i just wanted the beer not a cocktail .
love this place ! i will be frequenting often .
add in fries and a drink and my lunch total came to almost 14 bucks .
expensive . should definitely be 3 dollar sign .
1/2 off steaks ( and a gnocchi i just could n't pass up ) the vibe is straight up sexy , ( i never use that word because i feel awkward saying it out loud ) but its just dark , sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie .
ambiance : super casual mom and pop feel with open seating .
if it 's a beautiful cool evening , ask to sit outside and watch the downtown phoenix life .
ridiculously over priced when you considered the service .
the most annoying part of our experience was the lighting .
great wings ! crispy and fresh meat .
i honestly would have rather had a frozen pizza .
i got the basic chicken sandwich ( $ 5.95 ) and although it had a good flavor , it was very tough ( see picture ... and the sandwich itself was $ 5.95 with no sides ) .
smaller beer list with only 2 beers on tap , but some bottles to supplement it .
40 minutes before any food was brought out , small portions and expensive .
that 's right no water , no greeting nothing .
i did n't like the beans too much , they had a weird texture to them but did n't taste bad .
my best guess as we ordered different items was a dirty kitchen grill .
the manager was an idiot , just yelling at the clueless staff who all seemed like this was their first day on the job .
the drinks were good !
the fries look good but the 5 pieces of scallops are way over done .
i started with the blueberry mojito ( yum ) and my husband had the warm house sake .
i enjoyed their fried pickles , as well .
we were shown to are table which was very comfortable and had a great view of the tv !
the only reason for the 4 stars was because of the `` corny '' attire for the waitresses ... but some guys like the school girl look ( short plaid skirts ) .
there are very good alcoholic drink preferences here and i would return .
the meat was dry and not worth the 12.00 for the sandwich . also the fries were cold .
drink menu , great .
i was told to seat myself , the waitress took the order , somebody else served the order , after i was done i waited a while and the finally got the check . so , all the waitress did was take the order and give me a check .
the view , the wine list , the attentiveness , the renovations they 've done so carefully , the ducks ... but am a little frustrated .
the inside decor is nice too !
we shared a salad and it was excellent .
the bathroom was kind of dirty and there were n't any paper towels .
fish special was horrible and soupy with a weird flavor to the fish .
the presentation looked nice ( aside from the melting ice cream dripping off the cup ) but the way it 's assembled makes it impossible to eat .
not many beers on tap , but what they had were pretty good .
to be fair , the food is not bad . but would you like to wait forever and feel mistreated to have food that 's just okay ?
i recommend this place very strongly !
server was friendly and the chef came out to say hi and make sure we enjoyed our meal .
we went with wine over beer because they do not have beer on draft - there 's a large bottled beer selection but it would be nice if there were beers on draft .
it is served hot and fresh .
had oysters as a starter which were very good .
this is my new favorite brunch spot .
now mind you i was nice about it and even offered my receipt to show it was paid for and all i wanted was my food .
the prices are reasonable as well .
trying to introduce `` the cool '' factor in the design only detracted from the overall readability .
feeling overwhelmed with all this deliciousness , i started with a true ginger cocktail .
only 2 balls the size of a child 's fist for about 14 bucks .
prices are very reasonable .
they only had sapporo on tap . there is a pretty nice selection of bottled beers but they 're terribly overpriced for a bottle .
so bring your $ 60 and have a nice night .
sure , it happens , but this little gem is a must stop .
not bad , but they could definitely add some taps or bring in some bottled beer .
the food is stupendous and reasonably priced .
however it is a bit overprice ( around $ 8 ) and average wait time is around 15mins .
great desserts . food selection great .
everything tasted delicious - absolutely no complaints . even the portion sizes were perfect .
another 30 minutes for our food order on a to go order and the order was wrong .
a friend ordered their pomegranate ginger fizzy drink which was delicious . it had some lemonade which gave it a little tang and is very refreshing for a warm day .
as for alcohol it 's bottled beer and a few selections of wine only here .
stopped here late sunday for a burger .
their decor is lovely and spacious .
40 minutes after i ordered , i got my dumplings , and they taste bad , worse than the $ 5 per bag frozen dumplings from supermarket .
nice selection of after dinner drinks .
not bad , but they could definitely add some taps or bring in some bottled beer .
one of my friend had the watermelon cocktail and it 's the perfect summer drink : lightly sweetened and refreshing .
our server was very friendly and funny .
they also have a nice patio if you would like to sit outside .
its not great but pretty damn good especially when you consider the price of $ 3.95 . chinese food selections and apps such as hot wings are a notch lower in quality but still pretty good .
the floor was wet and dirty , and no tp or paper towels in the women 's room .
they have an amazing seafood salad .
prices are good - food is good .
it 's fun to experience the loud izakaya atmosphere but not a pleasant dinner experience when you ca n't hear the people you went to dinner with .
decent wine . good prices .
the server was attentive and was on top of the drinks for the table and the pitcher of beer !
it was n't as creepy as some people made it sound .
plus , the prices are super reasonable for the amount and quality of food you get .
portions are decent for the price .
portions were all small and obscenely expensive , probably 50 % more than i would expect to pay in the lower reaches of the top tier of sushi restaurants ! which is where i would place the quality of the food and freshness of the fish .
it was highly disappointing to discover on our bill that we were up charged for top shelf bourbon that we did not ask for nor given the option to request .
firstly , the prices were outrageous .
chacuterie and cheese was great , shrimp , breakfast items , salads and dessert !
the patio is nice and it 's an enjoyable atmosphere but my interactions with the staff just make me never want to come here .
the donuts were $ 1.50- $ 3 each but they are huge so that justifies the cost .
just a nice setting , cool older building , busy hip crowd , and great pizza that comes super hot and fresh out of the oven .
food : as a party of two , we ordered chicken tikka masala and shrimp vindaloo with naan . the dishes were tasty and we were well warned about the spice level .
the broth was bland , the flavours were hard to identify and it was even lacking in salt .
the flavors are full , bold and most importantly fresh .
i ordered an iced latte , which came in a nice and tall glass .
the ambiance of the restaurant is excellent with decor , furniture , lighting and general mood . the service was great and relatively quick as well .
the fries were over fried and burnt and a little cold and soggy .
anyone with common sense knows that cold and luke warm foods that are supposed to be hot are not within health standards and guidelines .
delicious and fast ! unique flavors on traditional wraps .
food is fantastic and the staff - totally customer oriented and ultra friendly .
the food was good and the prices reasonable .
i was n't really pleased with the ambiance either because it had a gaudy interior design .
the price is super affordable , too .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
the floor is n't the greatest , bathrooms ... let 's ignore those .
tequila selection was pretty good but the bartenders were clearly hired for other credentials than tequila knowledge , if you catch my drift .
it was quite expensive for the two meals and one beer.. around $ 50-60 !
this place is so cute and has a nice vibe . they have signature drinks that 's are made with lots of love .
great food and affordable prices .
the prices are really reasonable , and the service was pretty good .
oil was splattered to try and mask the low-quality , dry pasta .
my sister is a waitress so i understand how tough the job is , and i usually tip more than 15 % because i know being a waiter/waitress is a demanding job .
there is a minimum you need to spend to reserve the room , not sure of the price , but price per person ( sans vin ) came to about $ 100 each , not including tax , tip and all those other extras that can get tacked on .
we ordered a small order of oysters ( just two $ 5 each ) to me that seems a bit extreme as i have gone places where i can get a half or a dozen for a better price .
beer was just not good .
this place is really cute and has a great view , great for a fun , affordable dinner .
that cute waterfall by the stairs , the overcrowded dance floor with more guys than girls , the `` secret '' nook where the skeezy guys would drag their drunken dance partners ... and the bathroom !
seriously lacking as a beer bar .
the only beer they had was budweiser .
worth noting it is very loud inside so you should come expecting that kind of an atmosphere .
their vegetable dish was very good as well .
nice decor and ambiance .
my favorite is the koi martini made with absolut peach , fresh lime , mango puree , fresh sweet and sour ... wow !
the service was good , polite and attentive .
it 's cheap and quick .
happy drinking and eating : )
you will not be disappointed .
the cocktails , wine , food , and service were all outstanding .
this is a good place to get a reasonably priced vegas lunch .
the creamy crab puffs were so delicious & the yellow curry was full of flavor .
what i liked the most was that they were n't your typical rolls , they were ones i had n't had before .
fresh , high quality ingredients , incredible marinara , homemade everything ... there 's love on that plate .
it 's not everyday you see a church that serves beer but this place creates the illusion in a spectacular manor .
incredibly tasty food for a reasonable price .
the server was awkward and never checked on us . while my friend was waiting for his food , the server kept asking if we wanted more chips , not our actual order .
the restaurant is clean , well lit , has some good music , and the people are nice .
you guys trust me right .
everything that hit the table , including the dessert , was delicious . the fried rice and massive vegetable medley was awesome as well .
we also had margaritas which you could hardly taste anything but a pre-made margarita mix .
nice spot for a lunch or afternoon beer .
as far as the dining room it is clean and spacious and modern and comfortable .
they do n't serve hard alcohol , just beer and wine .
i had the patron xo tiramisu and it was pretty good , i 'll try something else next time . we drank the $ 15 sangria pitchers and it was pretty good .
speaking loud and talking about things that should not be spoken of in a restaurant .
the service was nice and the prices are cheaper for the value .
prices are reasonable , considering the quality of the food and beverages .
but hey , that 's part of its charm , right ?
good food . good prices .
we have n't had the food yet but this is a definite keeper so far i 'll keep you posted
potential customers , please do yourself a favor and stay clear ; the only valuable thing you 'd be ordering here is a life lesson .
i left a lengthy , detailed message and made sure to let them know that no , i do n't want any more free this or that to make up for your extremely unprofessional , possibly racist service and establishment .
to be honest , the entrance and bathrooms are actually kind of scary .
but i 'm guessing only because the restaurant was so empty and the servers were bored .
shawarma had a lovely cardamom flavor , and was cooked perfectly . the rice and humus had a nice balance that perfectly complimented the shawarma .
we are planning to return this week and take advantage of some fabulous happy hour food and drink specials . enjoy !
plus , the hummus with grilled chicken appetizer is now over $ 8.00 when it used to be about $ 6.00 ... .i understand inflation , but the timing seems off .
i had a chance to try even more of their great food at the appreciation gathering for the 2009 pride volunteers .
i think the total was over $ 50 for us all .
good prices . decent service .
the beer was good and cold , but i think i would rather have a draft house beer .
not sure about the decor .
the end of the world gin cocktail was refreshing and intoxicating .
the seating is a little close , but i still loved it .
walls are chipped up and needing attention and the lighting is just too bright .
the prices were reasonable enough .
the food was great per $ .
beer selection was good , but a gastropub should have unique vessels for drinks . cider in a guinness pint glass is just ... .wrong .
it was the perfect size !
the food was top-notch and the portion sizes were good . the presentation was also beautiful .
we still go there to sit at the bar , drink and play trivia , but not for the salsa , cold chips , cold bean dip and blah food .
great space for seating , the vibe is chill and a great place to get together and hang with friends .
food and drink wise ... i ordered a watermelon cooler .
only real negative was how dark it was ; jet black walls and ceilings , dim lights , but that was n't a big deal .
the prices are a great value .
everything is good here , impeccably done and impeccably presented .
potatoes greasy and not cooked , eggs had a strange flavor , biscuit dry . gravy was just ok. one of the worst breakfast i have ever had .
the prices are pretty decent too .
super healthy food in a very cool , rustic setting .
the grounds were beautifully landscaped and once we arrived the view of the golf course was a surprisingly wonderful view ( i 'm not even a golfer ) ; the weather was remarkable .
the sprite was good too , nice and refreshing .
service is great . pricing is a good value .
price is around 26.00 for dinner , great value .
i am here for business and this is my favorite restaurant i have eaten at so far .
flavor ! that is what you can expect , not bland .
i 've never heard any atmospheric music being played , the carpet is ugly , the furniture is boring and dark , and there is no privacy offered by the interior design .
it 's a lot of food for a decent price ( under $ 9 ) and , better yet , it 's healthy !
would advise coming and an extremely off time just so the wait will be shorter .
i got the chili and rice and it was the most delicious thing i have ever had from a vegan restaurant ! the staff was very friendly and courteous and the food was hot , cooked well and very tasty .
amazing meat and other sorts . definitely do n't be a vegetarian ( the meat is tempting ) .
looking to spend no more than $ 7 on some tacos and rice and beans , i was n't thrilled when i saw entrees for $ 12- $ 15 .
they have a happy hour menu with appetizers and drinks .
also very reasonably priced .
it has very limited seating , but it has an open kitchen ( which is pretty cool to see them making the hand pies . )
they also provided us with deliciously fresh bread with oil and pesto . everything tastes incredible and the white sangria was very refreshing .
is it just me or is lighting just crap at every hotel ?
4. the entire place was out of all draft beer except some shitty orange something .
excellent mixed drinks ( long island ice tea is what i had ) .
the beer was good , but the margarita came with no more than an inch of the glass rim salted ( `` is n't that bartending 101 ?
waitress took 5 minutes to get our drink order and did n't even know which beers on tap were craft beers , which for a bar that boasts that they have 50+ taps is really sad .
the price was right around $ 25 .
for 20 bucks , you 'd think breakfast would be fantastic .
they had a pretty good happy hour deal on drinks .
we both thought the beans were flavorful and delicious .
my burrito was decent at best , and the customer service was horrible . just walk away .
always have a great time here.. sexy ladies !
kind but like all salesmen trying to get you to order tequila , drinks , ( at 11 am ) beer , margaritas , dessert ? anything ?
new favorite spot . huge open space with games , live music and awesome menu .
people are super friendly and the ingredients are high-quality . do n't expect super cheap taco truck prices but very reasonable for the quality .
there was no beer on draft , and the waitress was inexperienced .
i expect customer service to be just as great as the food and that server ruined the experience for me .
the bill for the two of us was about $ 70 , which is a little pricey , but sushi is expensive to begin with , and my boyfriend does eat a lot of sushi .
many better places than this that will not cause awkward moments in front of business associates .
would recommend . i tried the berry mule drink and i was great .
thought the name meant beer or good drinks . beers were pricey .
for alcohol it is just wine and one kind of beer .
little disappointed it was in an unattractive shopping plaza but the inside had nice decor of local art .
got the almond crusted chicken tenders with truffle fries and the fish and chips . everything was good - my friend especially liked the sauces that came with the chicken tenders .
also the food is great and love the drinks and shots .
the good beer was n't on special at all , and their `` domestic '' beers were all pretty much the crap i wo n't drink .
the service was fast , but the bagel was tough and unappetizing .
the flavor was excellent , as well it should be , given the $ 16 price tag .
after such a bad experience you would think they would also cover the one glass of wine and pint of beer but nope !
tasty okonomiyaki fries ! great for after work `` happy hour '' with some cold , refreshing beer .
the beer selection was good and the cocktails were well made .
the draft and bottle beer selection is legit , but mostly focused on regional selections which was disappointing .
chicken and waffle with honey butter is to die for .
the service is nice and the prices are reasonable .
the service was stellar and so was the food ! we travel and dine out a lot and the entire family was happy here .
on top of that , the chicken was shredded into fine pieces .
ironically , even though the soup was not hot , the beef was already fully cooked ( if not overcooked ) when it came out - it was chewy and tasted like it had been cooked hours ago .
four of us shared a bottle of chianti ( $ 55 ) which we all enjoyed , but it was a tough decision with such an extensive wine list .
the parents can relax while the kids are having a good time playing in the back yard . adorable place !
every weekday they offer five for $ 5 . that means , they offer different appetizers for $ 5 , the burger for $ 5 and several drinks for only $ 5 .
great selection of retail as well which you can buy and drink for a $ 1 fee
i only had beer .
for less than $ 20 get you a nice dinner for two .
good beer list , but the waitress literally knew nothing about beer !
very expensive , not worth it .
if youre trying to have good food on a budget , this is the place for you ! this place is a pleasant surprise .
it 's pretty expensive compared to other ayce ( $ 25 weekend dinner , if i remember correctly ) .
pad see ew ( 2.5 stars ) pretty bland , not much flavor .
i was told they have a good selection of beers on tap .
and the prices are reasonable .
el diablo had the perfect bite on a super thin crisp crust .
great location for business and school .
got ta love the location !
pretty disappointing . at least it was a good amount .
this is the most expensive item on the menu ( $ 21 ) , and i would n't order it .
you chose a protein and two sides so i got my baby chicken with cucumbers and roasted sweet potatoes .
when we spoke to the man at the front desk to ask what time we were allowed to check in , the line had been extremely long and i guess their patience also ran thin .
the decor is pleasant but the darkness in the restaurant ( 7:30pm ) , reading the menu requires night vision goggles and makes the decor nearly invisible to appreciate .
beers were good ( even though they didnt have any beer specials ) ... hmmmm .
i do n't know if he knew how audible he was but it set for an uncomfortable setting knowing that perhaps your phone conversations etc are not very private knowing how thin the walls are ... .other than that the hotel does have a personable setting not being on the strip .
the beer was cold and the min bottle of champagne hit the spot .
great service . the prices are reasonable .
anyway , i took advantage of the happy hour beer specials , but unfortunately i really hated the second beer ( something by deschutes that i think might have been skunked ) .
the dining room is small and intimate and nicely decorated .
this is the largest indoor play area i 've been in by far .
for what you pay it 's a good deal .
beer choices were weak , wine choices were fine .
make sure you check your food before eating here . also , they do n't offer a discount or refund for the food .
this dish was disappointingly mediocre .
no draft beer , but a decent choice of cans and bottles .
the place is attractive , but neither upscale nor particularly intimate though we required a flashlight to read the menus .
the price is ridiculously cheap .
lackluster food : dry bread , bland sauces , boring steak .
sucks for pictures , pretty dark .
this is a great place to take a ditzy first date because they play the music so loud it 's impossible to have any kind of a decent conversation .
its a bit overpriced , but normal for vegas .
not the way to treat guest spending good money .
and the prices are great .
the hookah is $ 30 , i think that is a little over priced , i usually you only pay about $ 20 .
waited forever for a waitress to take our drink order . she did n't apologize for the long wait and wage was kind of cranky to boot .
not too shabby and their prices were pretty good .
try the bulgogi dupbap ( seasoned beef with rice ) or dak balls ( fried chicken ) for a delicious meal !
nothing fancy , cheery interior , decent food ... four stars .
and not to expensive either
the scenery at the wigwam was very elegant and there were plenty of beautiful butterflies around .
unfortunately , no bud light lime on tap so we just drank regular beer .
the price is high , but you pay for not only the drink , but also the presentation .
they have a good tequila list though i was n't drinking tonight .
this place used to be some retail shop and on either side of the door are these nice tables in display windows .
this was like a fruity club soda with a super refreshing taste .
the baklava was obviously home made and very light , sweet , and fluffy .
the linens were neat , no ugly 90 's geometric pattern on the comforter , unfortunately it was on the curtains and on the carpet . the bathroom was small , but clean .
my only suggestion would be to have regular lemonade to mix with the selection of iced teas .
i 'm not sure what the magic ingredient is to achieving a `` retro '' rather than `` old and neglected '' ambiance , but fresh floor tiles ( or , you know , something sensible like laminate ) and seat cushions that are not held together by duct tape would be a start .
horrible service . the waiters/waitresses take a million years to get your drinks and to get your food , expect to be waiting 40+ mins when it 's not that busy either .
i think for the price we paid it was a very beautiful hotel for a cheap price .
i love to mix their regular and raspberry lemonades for the perfect drink to compliment !
i was a little disappointed . the chicken was quite good and the burrito itself was n't bad , but i was really hoping that the goat cheese would be more prominent .
agree with other reviews here who have eluded to the `` chill '' vibe . given the neighbourhood , definitely not pretentious .
decent margarita , but in the wrong glass .
i would say some items were just a bit salty but i think that 's the nature of the food itself so not a huge deal .
they have a full bar but i was more impressed with the 20 or so craft beers on tap .
they run for like 2-3 minutes , then they 're off for 15. again though , when they were actually on , they do look absolutely stunning .
erin had a very confusing sunday yesterday .
our favorite dennys . we love mary who has been here for several years .
to be fair the food was really good , however guys the portions are so small that you will need to spend about $ 50 to almost feel like you had a meal .
the place was clean and staff were attentive .
it 's just an awkward setup .
6 beers on tap and only one watered down version if a beer , so that 's a plus .
not the cheapest lunch but high quality food and filling portions .
we enjoyed every cocktail we got ( ) .
the food is cheap .
however , the lack of entree options and food was disappointing .
prices are cheap and food is good !
they have a decent draft beer selection , and even more in bottles .
did n't feel uncomfortable and parking was plentiful and good lighting .
their whiskey selection is quite large and the server did a great job every time of letting us know which glass was which as they are brought over in three glass flights .
the bathroom is n't necessarily dirty , but it is very rundown .
not sure who came up with the whacked cocktail menu but fortunately they have a good selection of craft beer on tap .
i have also explored some of the shops and saw the beatles love show the year before .
this place can not afford to compensate fish much worse any apologies whatever happened to good ole customer service ?
they do have a great list of sake though .
the decor was warm and has a lot of character .
the men 's restroom was filthy with water or something on the floor .
felt welcomed , tried their bbq combo plate and it was great . mac salad is amazing !
nothing was bad per se but i found everything to be rather one-note in terms of flavour .
considering the quality of the food , the price seemed a bit high for me ( tip : use your total rewards card to save $ 1-2 on each dish ) .
my hubby had a drink with bourbon and berries in it that was also refreshingly tasty and i do n't usually care for hard liquor . the butterscotch pudding was also amazing .
the prices are more expensive and it seems a bit smaller .
delicious ( and strong ! )
i fished out a 3 inch strand of hair out of the mouthful i had right in front of her ?
highly recommend . nice area , quiet , and with a lovely patio .
it was a bit loud , but the music was great and upbeat , and it was not so loud that we could n't carry on a conversation .
a glass of canadian wine was also quite nice .
they had about 15 beers on tap and they were pretty impressive .
the flavors were good , however it was a bit dry .
it was 17 dollars a person which is n't bad for a vegas buffet , but the buffet is tiny .
they were all very attentive and informative .
not only that but then we saw a family of 6 get seated right next to us basically blocking our way making them get up every time we wanted to go get food .
yes it is `` dated '' and lovingly cared for , no it is not the hip painted concrete floors , pin lights , and open ceiling ... get over it , it is part of the experience .
the service also extremely pleasant and professional .
but she did n't seem to care that i would be paying for a meal and only had two bites and clearly did not enjoy it at all .
the tuna melt i ordered was superb !
did n't drink , but good draft selection . reccomended .
it was a group of 6. we were told it would be a 40 minute wait but we only waited about 20 minutes .
very bland food , basically a take out place . they have beers listed on the menu board but they were out of drafts , out of modelo , and the corona was n't cold !
entrance is kind of odd , just a heads up .
atmosphere was light , great view of capitol , though loud .
prices are on the high side , but the quality is great .
great idea in theory , but undercooked ( and i do not mean al dente , i really mean undercooked ) and oversalted .
the prices were pretty reasonable as well .
and a wonderful selection of drinks ( try the bloody mary - it comes with a beer chaser ) .
